__label__0 That ' s OK &mdash; my pleasure. Have you tried the IMDb ? __label__0 Hello Erin, and welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which Drupal version are you interested ? __label__0 A regular `<img src="URL" />` worked for me, but it was an image that I hosted off - site. That doesn ' t work for you ? __label__0 Your example above works for me. What kind of output are you getting ? __label__0 Sorry to up this, I found it via google, but it seems to work when the private static final field is a primitive type. Does anyone have an idea why ?__label__0 Understood, been there. ;) Maybe I ' ll check out Carrierwave (HVAC?).__label__0 Out of curiosity, why would a user choose to disable multitasking (i . e. what ' s the tradeoff)?__label__0 Can you please paste the code where you read the integers? Also, what compiler are you using, and on which platform ? __label__0 Yes, I apologize, my friend (I guess I have some kind of a phobia that you will forget about my posts :) ) I will wait as long as you want me to. Could you read Mir Harven ' s posts on talk page ? __label__0 Hello, our project has begun to fall a little bit behind the collaboration / organization department, would you, as an experienced editor be willing to help us revamp how we deal with issues? The template is a little behind because of this, but it points to some good places:) Do you have anything in particular you would like to do with us ? __label__0 That was nice work you did improving the reference I added. I still have to learn that, can you show me ? __label__0 Thank you for your answer. What are the sources for region 4 (Australia) release dates ? __label__0 Thanks. BTW, should I mince the parsley before frying it ? __label__0 @Micheal- Thanks . Could you please elaborate on how I could set this up ? __label__0 Congrats! I thought you were going to be away today ? __label__0 Hi - how ' s it going? Do you need more time ? __label__0 ok thanks. Any help I can get ? __label__0 Hey thanks for reassessing the <url> article to B class. So what ' s need to be done to make it GA ? __label__0 It seems you have been investigating this administrator and have brought up several incidents in your evidence based on that. If possible, could you please link to the feedback that Dreadstar has received as an administrator during / after each of those incidents (and if there was no feedback to any of those incidents, could you please let me know in reply to this)?__label__0 Please can you show the exact code that fails, for example, if this is in a view, paste in the relevant part. Is it "<%= sanitized _ text ( truncate ( msword _ text)) %>" that fails and "<%= sanitized _ text ( msword _ text) %> that is okay ? __label__0 Hey, Another editor and I are confused by your resent edit. "Should the non - AQ qulify for the BCS Championship, and face either the Big Ten or Pac - 10 Champion, the Rose Bowl may replace that champion with a team from same conference, so long as it is in the Top 14 of the final BCS Standings" Could you please clarify it for us ? __label__0 I have just put the article to peer review. Would you care to take a look ? __label__0 Thanks for readjusting the <url> remarks on stationsby - I must confess I ' m not that much into Danish history, so my edit contained some guesswork.. thanks for correcting me. Do I understand correctly that a Stationsby would not be the station that originaly is intended for a town further away, around which then a new town grows up ? __label__0 I have seen 'webform - revisions' module, but it solves nothing to me. Have you got that functionality working ? __label__0 I don ' t want to be your enemy. What can I do to help this situation ? __label__0 @Lukas I ' m faced with a similar problem at the moment. Did you ever find a good solution ? __label__0 Thanks, I forgot to add this . Where shall I add it in the list ?__label__0  [ nvidia - 96](http://apt . ubuntu . com / p / nvidia - 96) should be what you need. What is the output of `dmesg | grep -i nvidia` and `grep -i nvidia /var / log / Xorg . 0 . log`?__label__0 Thanks for pointing out that "undiscussed moves" discussion, I hope something comes out of that - but it doesn ' t really look like it will. I ' m not sure what I ' m looking for on the discussion page for <url> about this, what am I missing ? __label__0 Hi, thanks for the bounty. I wonder, did things turn out OK ? __label__0 thank you for that. Do you think it is possible it just is the limit screws ? __label__0 Thanks for your prompt action at AN / I and on behalf of NawlinWiki; as you gathered, I wasn ' t sure what to do but it ' s clear that you did. Two questions: is there any policy of which I should have been aware that governs this situation, and what (if anything) needs to happen to notify NawlinWiki ? __label__0 sorry, wasn ' t really thinking about a definitive question. could we just say that my question is: is my interpretation valid or does it contain some problems ? __label__0 On the WP : Football discussion you mentioned that Man City had 150 , 00+ views more than the seasons article. Please could you tell me where I can find page - views for wiki articles ? __label__0 You ' ve contributed a lot to Puget Sound area articles. Would you be willing to take a look at the debate I ' m having at <url> and do whatever you think is best ? __label__0 @cb Please note that some angles are not cyclic: the approach angle in the original question is a good example. If you have a specific follow - up question, why not post it ? __label__0 Hey, Rcej! ;) Would you be up to reviewing <url>?__label__0 Thanks Cameron. That makes sense, but then why isn ' t this access restricted to only copy constructors and assignment operators ? __label__0 Thanks for your input. Would you mind voicing your opinion in the GMC ' s talk page ? __label__0 Yeah I ' d be happy to look at the list, however can ' t promise much! Shall we discuss it on the article ' s talk page so that any comments are in the relevent place ? __label__0 I am happy to rewrite it but please explain to me how it is any different from the Warrior Lacrosse and STX pages? They don ' t have any links except to their own websites ? __label__0 Dude, awesome planning. Also, since there ' s at least two ways to do pretty much anything, how would you know if they are right or not ? __label__0 Oops, this was meant to be on Stack Overflow. Can someone migrate it please ? __label__0 Thanks for the help! That info should be on <url> in easy to read form, no ? __label__0 I also found your audio uploads at <url>. If it ' s not a burden, would you mind recording more Hungarian town names for WP ? __label__0 I know `in` is a keyword, used in loops, is it a method too? If so, can you give us an example of usage ? __label__0 Yes, my feeling is to err on the safe side here. Thanks for your comment, is it okay if I quote you on the commons thread ? __label__0 Should be "expect" instead of "respect". And also, please see my added question "Do I have to know about Escher and Bach?"__label__0 That example sentence doesn ' t really feel right. You sure you don ' t mean to use the past perfect ? __label__0 Thanks for the detailed reply. Can a random admin who notices the image with the speedy tag do something useful to fix the situation ? __label__0 I ' ve restored the histories of the userboxes; however, I would think it better to move them rather that cnp - move. Do you mind if I migrate these to your userspace for you ? __label__0 @marc thanks. how can i fix it ? __label__0 thanks dana-- that ' s really great! any way to add a slider to control zoom level ? __label__0 Many thanks. I ' m afraid I don ' t know the reel - is it played in your part or the world ? __label__0 Hi, I noticed that you ' ve pointed out an accuracy in the restoration of <url> used in the article. I ' ve just started up a review page for paleoart here, and started a section for that image: <url> Would you mind commenting on it so it can be fixed ? __label__0 putting the keyword (with special character) in quotes does not work. is there any other methods ? __label__0 Are you looking for something that gives you a global view? For instance to see the difference in load time from Texas and Tokyo ? __label__0 Hello, it was requested that some of the details be removed so as to make the article a bit more general. Is that ok ? __label__0 Hey just wanted to say thanks for giving me the Autopatrolled thing! Just curious though, what did I do to get it ? __label__0 Please be a bit more precise. What language are you developing in ? __label__0 Hey Sai - I ' m having trouble picturing it my head. Any chance you have a design or a sketch for it ? __label__0 @OMG Ponies: I believe you. :) So, am I misunderstanding that I should be able to access the information from within both tables or am I horribly misunderstanding *how* to set up the tables ? __label__0 Sorry for not replying sooner. What would you like done with your page ? __label__0 Thank you. Do you have any tips on the Kathy Dunderdale article to improve it ? __label__0 I know what KMP stands for but not BM. Would you mind writing down what each of them stands for, in case others don ' t know ? __label__0 Thank you. So what did I do to earn the tea ? __label__0 Hi Deb, I created the page which was deleted which I hoped could have been a stub starting point for building up a better and more detailed article about the organisation. Could you offer some advice on how I could have made it better and have avoided deletion ? __label__0 Hey, I just noticed that you are NOT an administator, I had always assumed that you were. I wondered if you would be interested in being nominated ? __label__0 think this is too time localised to be on - topic. Any other thoughts ? __label__0 Can you please clarify, if you only care about the weights, why you don ' t simply do `data [ x] += w`? What do you care about besides the weights ? __label__0 Thanks for the <nowiki>{{For</nowiki> templates on Tkachyovs, they help a lot. Maybe in this case we should use the patronimics in the titles and have Alexander Tkachyov as a disambig ? __label__0 I disagree with your edit of the 21st of November. Would you object to me inserting a new version based around the word 'Notwithstanding'?__label__0 @Charles: Can you elaborate on the idea with the tagged PDFs? Could it be possible to export the annotations from a tagged PDF and then use this to make changes to my original LaTeX sources ? __label__0 I love it. Two immediate thoughts (1) what about mapping the space based on probabilities (2) what would a scheme to try and identify the or incorrect answers look like ? __label__0 Is there any real world current sources? How can I implement a current source from a voltage source ? __label__0 I ' m glad you ' re pleased with the general appearance. Before I label all the streets, is the text size, font style, etc OK ? __label__0 I tried to make some improvements to the article. What do you think ? __label__0 @MitMaro Thanks. Could you please do the math of whether it ' s useful or not? :)__label__0 I would like to first thank you for coding the afd helper app. Secondly, is it possible it could be changed to work with other XfDs ? __label__0 I ' m not really sure what you ' re looking for that pinvoke . net doesn ' t provide. Can you cite an example where it didn ' t give you what you needed ? __label__0 Thank you for taking the time to dig up the references. Are you planning on integrating them into the article sometime soon ? __label__0 Good luck with the remaining time for your nomination. BTW: under what section on <url> do you think it should appear ? __label__0 These are the SC1 hotkeys, but it is tagged and titled with SC2. Which one is the mistake ? __label__0 Hi Royalbroil, I can ' t seem to find a hook I entered in DYK Feb 24, it ' s about the novel <url>, along with suggestions from other eds. Can you find what happened to it, please ? __label__0 High level questions are fine, but this one is really broad. It would help if you could narrow your question to something a little more specific or provide more context ? __label__0 @Paul R: Ok, I have edited my question. Is it better now or something is missing ? __label__0 Nice work. :) Got anything for <url> or <url>?__label__0 What ' s the problem with Gmail about privacy? The only issue I saw recently was Google Buzz but I ' m not sure that affected the Google Apps accounts, did it ? __label__0 yep :-) sorry for the confusion. any other ideas ? __label__0 @cjm: Good point. Are you creating this PDF yourself, or is it from some 3rd party ? __label__0 That is the correct way (AFAIK) for embedding a thumbnail into an RSS feed. What result are you seeing and what result would you expect ? __label__0 Thank you for catching Known for Know. How did you happen to look at the article ? __label__0 I ' m sorry, but I do feel that this is *way* off - topic for a [programming / scripting website](http://stackoverflow . com / faq/). Perhaps [Super User](http://superuser . com/) might be a better fit; or [Doctype](http://doctype . com/)?__label__0 A quick google search shows lots of good free generators. Are you looking for anything in particular ? __label__0 Well, the title may say it all but _"all"_ isn ' t enough for me to understand what you are asking. Can you please elaborate ? __label__0 It doesn ' t increase exponentially (a^x); it increases quadratically (x^2). Can you correct the title ? __label__0 the ability to read and write in Korean. (including in the source) So are you writing this from scratch or modifying an existing one ? __label__0 Thanks for that - very nicely commented code (rare to see)! It seems to need a table to be set up - do you have the schema or sql for that handy ? __label__0 So, if I understand the issue, you need to find the superset of the vertices and get the centroid of each set therein. Then create every plane that intersects every two of those along with the centroid of the simplex.. is that right ? __label__0 Excellent, thank you! Can you also delete the <url> from en and move hooks from the <url> to <url>?__label__0 Just iterating. Though I ' m curious, what would be the difference in approach ? __label__0 Ok thank you so much. How long have you been on Wikipedia ? __label__0 Hello, I noticed you recently did a lot of work on the ''<url>'' page. I was wondering if you know of the origin of the word "Nassarius" - its etymology/ what is it named after ? __label__0 I can ' t parse the For example part. Can you provide a clearer example ? __label__0 Thanks for your work in cleaning up <url> (which is now finished, but for a few hard cases which likely will require the writing of articles to conform to those links). Would you like to collaborate on another section of this list ? __label__0 please provide a more detailed example, because I don ' t understand what you mean by concatenating objects. I know what it means for strings: `"a" + "b"` => `"ab"`, But what should the resulting Object (Person) look like ? __label__0 Noticed you ' ve been holding the fort alone.. again :) Thought I ' d drop by and say hello. Surely your sanity has reached its limits by now ? __label__0 Have you looked at free GUI automation tools like [AutoIt](http://ww . autoitscript . com / site / autoit/)? Maybe it can do what you need ? __label__0 @anony: Nice question! Can you share the site where you found the question ? __label__0 Thanks for continuing to look over the article. Do you know or do you know anyone that knows anything about the <url> or the <url>?__label__0 Thank you for getting to all those WikiProject Canada assessements so quickly! Question, is it ''useful'' what I ' m doing, adding the template even to what I know will be relative low importance articles ? __label__0 Good question! What formula did you attempt, and in what situations was it wrong ? __label__0 Rainer -- thanks. Perhaps you could post an answer with your changes made so that I could see them ? __label__0 Ok! First things first, is there anything in particular you would like me to help you out with ? __label__0 Hey, what do you think if instead of naming surahs like this <url>, we add the surah number to each like : "Surah 1, Al - Fatiha". Would u agree with such page moves ? __label__0 Thank you much! May I call upon you if I make mistakes or need help, then, please ? __label__0 @Nikolay O. : Thanks for your input. What exactly unbrekable space character means ? __label__0 Thanks for the username change. Now, one last thingu2014since the account 'Dalahxe4st' already exists on Swedish Wikipedia and doesn ' t appear to have been taken over automatically, where should I go to take care of that ? __label__0 Please specify the environment / language in the question / tags. Is it .net / winforms ? __label__0 Hi Gareth. I was wondering if you could point me in the right direction for learning about building a wikipedia profile ? __label__0 What do you actually want? Check if a certificate is valid, or force `wget` to connect only if a certificate is valid ? __label__0 Thanks! Do you know why this was held jointly and what was worked on ? __label__0 $N$ is not know? Could you please confirm ? __label__0 Awesome exercise! How do I donate money to this school ? __label__0 Nice work! Since you dug up some information on Fahnbulleh, I ' m curious u2014 do you know what relation he is to Ambassador Henry Fahnbulleh, whom Tubman accused of an attempted coup ? __label__0 There are many factors that influence the layout and size of an ImageView. Are you able to share the layout file ? __label__0 Hi. I uploaded three very nice images in the <url>, can you please tell me what breed could that dog be ? __label__0 Good question. I wonder if it should be migrated to CS Theory (http://cstheory . stackexchange . com/) or Programmers (http://programmers . stackexchange . com/) ?__label__0 Which would be a good addition: "I just did the problem and thought it ' s an interesting question. What are your thoughts / ideas on this?"__label__0 Thanks for your assistance in the review of the Brian Keith review at the DYK! The user has cited the Internet Movie Database before ? __label__0 Thanks for your advice on my problems with categories. Perhaps someone should change the instructions ? __label__0 I used the <url> tool, and clicked rather a lot. I ' m happy to switch it on for your account, if you ' d like ? __label__0 How about this: "Probably a lot, I had better get started (pull out a pad and pencil) What will you be eating for dinner tonight? (start writing) Okay, well I better get on the phone to find out about everyone else, what is the long distance code for your phones?"__label__0 With all due respect, that is going to take ages. How can one create a 'Bot' to do all this for me for <url>, <url>, <url>, <url> and <url>?__label__0 can you explain more please ?__label__0 um.. sorry.. i mean.. getting 100 results or 200 results from above search affects page rank or not? is 200 results better than 100 results in terms of SEO ? __label__0 Ah the error says a location is not trusted. How do I fix this ? __label__0 I ' ve made a start to putting the list in chart form at <url>. Can you think of any other columns to add ? __label__0 Hey, thanks for your contributions here :). Would you mind referencing them to conform with wiki - policy ? __label__0 Thank you very much for fixing the broken references in <url> and related articles. Are you planning to fix them in <url> as well ? __label__0 @George, will this work in Fedora 15 under the new Gnome 3? Is it in the repositories ? __label__0 My first impression is that it is indeed with the StackPanel, since it ' s default is to "shrink" around elements. Have you tried using a fixed size container and adjusting the width, if needed, as part of the animation ? __label__0 I ' ve seen this happen when my application crashes. If you run your app without breakpoints, do you experience a crash ? __label__0 Thanks--can you add the romanization of the Arabic at <url> too? Is it ''jibna baladi''?__label__0 Good work on the canal junctions! Where appropriate, do you think we should give the nearest pedestrian access point, from the road (as opposed to canal) network ? __label__0 I noticed that you did some work on this article, and would like to expand it to include his recommendation (in ''Can Life Prevail'') that the UN develop hit squads to target large urban population centers (with neutron bombs as I recall), and also the discussion on the 9 / 11 terrorists being "superior moral human beings" for their actions. Understanding that this is a BLP, that NPOV is important, and that including secondary sources is nearly impossible as they are difficult (at best) to find, what is your feeling on this ? __label__0 Default search comes with user search. You can ' t use that ? __label__0 I had a look at the place noted on the top of the talk page about 1rr and I was unable to find the sanction you talked about. Where is it listed please ? __label__0 Thanks for offer of help on IRC - terminology completely baffling to me (not helped by freenode instructions written as if translated through several languages into final english) - just which channel are admins supposed to log into, and how does one register when it seems by invitation only. Finally what on earth is a cloak ?__label__0 Don ' t worry I understand. Using igloo I assume ? __label__0 At <url> there ' s a request that seems to cry out for a Wikipedian with a subscription to the Daily Gleaner. Might you be able to help ? __label__0 This is quite cool, I ' d almost consider suggesting the ability to encrypt the answers to your question for a day on user voice with a clickable "decrypt" link or something. What do other think ? __label__0 Thanks Chris. Appreciate the prompt response. Would I need to add any cleanser after physically removing it ? __label__0 Please describe, what happens if you try to boot. What boot options are used ? __label__0 Mattisse hun, you haven ' t been on wiki for a couple of weeks. Are you ok ? __label__0 Could you please elaborate for me? (RDB are not my strongest suit so forgive my ignorance) How can I normalize when there is only one table and no relationships ? __label__0 Eh. Fresh pasta takes less than 3 minutes to cook in boiling water. Why would you need to microwave this ? __label__0 Except for the one about the Chevrolet Monza bit at the middle which came from the Prototype book, was in fact come from the Brumos website, but the last time I read that was back in February 2001. Also is with the referencing, the page is now a total mess, is there a way that could be sorted out, I would be very thankful if you could help ? __label__0 TSOP is a series of IR receivers by [Vishay](http://ww . vishay . com / ir - receiver - modules/), here it doesn ' t mean "thin small outline package" or something like that. Right, gomek ? __label__0 ww - hey, good work on the new pages that you ' ve added in the last couple of days (5 - 6 isn ' t it?). I add them to <url> when I notice them, but I ' m not sure that I catch them all; I don ' t suppose you could add them to the list on creation ? __label__0 I am using the 3 . x Python version. I figured that since I am new to the language, I should try to learn the newest version - is that faulty logic ? __label__0 Avogadro ' s number ($6 . 02 \times 10^{23} \mathrm { mol}^{-1}$) and Boltzmann constant ($1 . 38 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm { J}\,\mathrm { K}^{-1}$) are two totally unrelated constants. You want to estimate both ? __label__0 Thanks, will check that out. Is there a advantage / disadvantage using setjmp / longjmp over signals as proposed below ? __label__0 Is it possible that you ' re caching values that some code paths don ' t actually use? Could you be caching things that are only used once ? __label__0 I ' m interested in why you reduced the columns from 5 to 2? Could you reply on my talk page please ? __label__0 I received a message from the bot you run telling me that one of two duplicate files I uploaded is due for speedy deletion. If possible, could it be made that Bath _ badge . png is the one that is deleted, rather than Bath _ rugby _ badge . png please ? __label__0 In the <url> article, is polar mount correct? It might be improved by a bit more detail about how it works, perhaps ? __label__0 Internet Explorer may cause that. Can you check IE permissions please ? __label__0 These clickable images are great! Can you make one for the 10^-6 to 10^5 range too ? __label__0 i didn ' t think to look for the borders, it ' s a nice idea. but how can i distinguish between other borders that the image contains ? __label__0 Thanks for the infomative reply -- I wasn ' t really questioning your putting the image in the infobox; appearance - wise I don ' t think it makes much difference. It is better, though, I think, to have the thumbnail indicator -- Is it possible to have that inside the infobox ? __label__0 The question is ambiguous. Can you please be more specific ? __label__0 Thanks Tom! Still getting 'broken / missing handler' errors when adding filters though.. Any ideas ? __label__0 I ' m not familiar with that article. Can you please specify the exact article title ? __label__0 When you say "single page", you mean when you view a blog post page? And when you say "page template", you mean when you view a blog "page", like About Us ? __label__0 Thanks for your response. What happens now ? __label__0 Can you be more precise about what exactly the system needs to achieve? Something like "Given X initial data, output Y"?__label__0 Can you expand on your question? Are one of the arguments in this function supposed to be passed from the server ? __label__0 You are very welcome. Isn ' t it great we can all create a better world ? __label__0 Do you think the term standard means this is THE standard today ? Isn ' t it like asking why principal component are "principal" and not secondary ?__label__0 The best case would be if the list were already sorted but I don ' t think that ' s what you ' re asking. Could you be more specific ? __label__0 Thanks for approving my request. Should I remove my request ? __label__0 @spinning _ plate - These are useful links. Do you know by any chance if parallelizing the computation will speed up the processing and if so how can a graph traversal problem like this be broken down into smaller pieces computable on numerous machines ? __label__0 Depending on the CUDA version you are using, device emulation may not be available, as it has been deprecated and possibly removed. Is it feasible to get another GPU (a cheap one for display maybe)?__label__0 If you only want a finite number N of oracles, you could define an N - in - 1 compound oracle by using the first log ( N) bits of the compound oracle to indicate which suboracle you wish to query.

Could you please take a moment and provide the code I would need to add which would allow me to achieve these goals ? __label__0 Hi, I was removed from the "request for approval" list at the vandalproof, and not put on either the "approved" or "denied" lists. Could you tell me why, please ? __label__0 Good advice from Garion96 there. Would you please come to the talk page of the template and voice your opinion ? __label__0 Jeff300, thanks a lot for your help with the article. But I ' m just curious - why was the link to the article for "Advent of Divine Justice" deleted ? __label__0 Hi there, I ' ve raised the possibility of unprotecting the tamazepam page <url>. What are your thoughts ? __label__0 i want to insert data whole data of array into vector of a map without using for loops. is it possible to push back data set into vector of map ? __label__0 PS I am planning on starting an article on ''<url>'' (<url>). Maybe you ' d like to help ? __label__0 It seems to work fine for me. Can you check if there is any place that is doing a HtmlEncode() replacement on hlNonTerminal . Attributes["onclick"]?__label__0 It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Do you have a user, entering a name and address, and you are going to show him all similar addresses to let him choose one manually, or are you going to group all Persons with similar addresses automatically together ? __label__0 I don ' t understand how a folder - based file system is not a hierarchical system. Could you please explain further ? __label__0 Hi, I did post at <url> about the new Civil Ensign for Jersey but I ' ve not had a reply yet. Any thoughts ? __label__0 Hi, I see you voted "support" but in the neutral section. Would you like to move that to the support section ? __label__0 At least there ' s nothing ungrammatical about them. Could you elaborate on why you have doubts about their correctness ? __label__0 Thanks for that, hopefully I have input this correctly. This page also seems to be flagged due to several issues, surely these can now be removed as the page has proved its worth as much as pages like <url> have ? __label__0 Thanks for the redirect help! Is that something I can do myself in the future, or is that an admin thing ? __label__0 @Jakub Hampl: At my current stage of design, it is more of a logic based game rather than an animation driven game. Out of curiosity, could you expand on the more powerful topic you were mentioning ? __label__0 Thank you for contacting me, the history has been restored given the link you provided. Would you mind assisting with sourcing of the article so that it complies with <url> policy ? __label__0 Great question. Perhaps it should have the pronunciation tag ? __label__0 I ' m very impressed with your work getting Niagara County ' s NRHP list filled out with pictures and articles! Did you take most of those new pictures yourself ? __label__0 I ' ve made some improvements to <url>, keeping in mind your previous comments about the article.

Can you please restore this and I can send in the email granting me permission to post ? __label__0 An API is not at fault if they allow requests to take place more than 30 time in 5 seconds, right? Or do we need to build throttling into our API ? __label__0 I ' ve created another question to track the single - speed portion of the question. http://bicycles . stackexchange . com / questions / 1983/ Here we can talk about "why no freewheel?"__label__0 Thanks for the info but the page is still giving the same warnings. Any ideas why this might be happening ? __label__0 @Sriram : yup I will think of it on a small scale first ..then perhaps later will look into the bigger picture :-) ..thanks for ur suggestions !! :-) so what do u feel hw should one get started with this ?__label__0 oops, sorry i re - edited my post. can you please validate it with the .xml doc i just posted it ?__label__0 hey @yoda .thnks fr helping me out!..can u please post the above comment in my question as edit ..? it says i cant as am not allowed 2 post imagess ??__label__0 Thanks, though. This was a much more interesting question than "how do you make a positive number negative in C#?"__label__0 I ' ve never heard of either of those. What country are you in ? __label__0 Hello Jeffq, I noticed you revert vandalism occasionally. Would you like me to grant your account <url> to help you revert vandalism more easily ? __label__0 I ' ve been trying to convince this user that his only problem is his username, but he doesn ' t seem to fully believe it. Would you mind popping over and giving a word or two of encouragement ? __label__0 +1 for "Because I ' m lazy..". Ever considered a career as a developer? :)__label__0 The block seems to no longer be necessary or productive. If I were to bring a motion to get them unblocked, would you support it ? __label__0 True. What do you think about the notability of this particular article ? __label__0 Ahh.. My apologies. You wouldn ' t be using the google toolbar perchance ? __label__0 Hey. I ' m proposing a <url> - would you be interested in coming along ? __label__0 Thank you for closing out this debate. Can you please restore the history for GFDL purposes ? __label__0 After having collected some users willing to come, I created <url> subpage. Would you be so kind and add your ideas ? __label__0 Yes, the edges are always axis aligned (I will update the post). Could you give more detail on the scan line approach? Thx . __label__0 Those of us who ' ve been here the whole time are pretty incredulous about it also. :) We miss your fine editing style and hope you come back sometime -- keep looking in on us now and then, at least ? __label__0 Good work maintaining the Tibet page i seems to getting an increasing amount of traffic!! Is our Chinese friend still persisting ? __label__0 I see you haven ' t even tried posing your issue as an actual question on this site. Care to give it a try ? __label__0 Thank you for removing the "Speedy Deletion" from my post. I realise that I still need to do more work on the post itself, but are the sources that I am using acceptable ? __label__0 The new features of Hotcat are excellent: whom do I thank for this? :-) Are you still its maintainer ? __label__0 Hey poetic decay, I was planing on merging <url>, <url>, <url>, <url> and <url> together. You think you could help me with it ? __label__0 Nice pie chart for mobile phone contractor %'s during 3rd quarter 2008. Was just wondering though which country the chart represents as I think perhaps this should be mentioned ? __label__0 How did you fix this. It doesn ' t seem that simply moving your views into separate modules would work ? __label__0 @joelt -- good point, which I think is the ultimate debate going on now by the answerers below, but I would like to know (@everyone) how much of a difference is it at the beginning until they converge? How significant is it to affect the resulting algorithm ? __label__0 I wondered if you could recommend the best book on <url>. FOr Christmas, what would be the most detailed book (with lots of beautiful photographs) of Ladakh ? __label__0 Not sure what you ' re asking exactly. Can you give an example of sample input and output ? __label__0 Hope that you don ' t mind, I modified your comment in the Craig intro, using a nice new template that I found. Check it out: what do you think ? __label__0 Thanks for putting the igneous rock template on all of those articles - it looks really useful! Do you think it should have an ultramafic section added ? __label__0 The Indian collaboration of the week will be the <url> next week. Would you be interested in joining us to make it a Featured Article ? __label__0 Hi, Schutz; it ' s still busted. Would it be OK with you if I asked GimmeBot to take over the mainpage bolding ? __label__0 Cool, I ' d be happy to help out. :-) What kind of things are you thinking about removing or adding ? __label__0 Good job working on the list, thanks. Could you make sure you move them from "To do" to "Done" when you finish ? __label__0 You ' ll have to give us a bit more context here. Can you provide a code snippet that displays this problem ? __label__0 Hey, I found <url> and at around 1 : 10, I think I can see the Backstreet Boys holding platinum discs (or double platinum, I ' m not sure) for Backstreet ' s Back and Millennium. Can you please verify and is it possible to use this as a source for adding South African certifications ? __label__0 You can construct a unique Binary Search Tree given any two traversals, are you looking to do that or are you in search of something else? If not please elaborate what you mean by non unique trees ? __label__0 Thanks for the advice. Quick question, is the efficiency gain in both the where and sum methods ? __label__0  ( undent) Your Chinese is much better than mine. Is it possible in Chinese to omit a conjunction such as u548c or u8ddf and let a string of two successive nouns refer to a set of two objects ? __label__0 After looking through a bunch of those, I think the lead should be formatted like this: a paragraph explaining who he is, a paragraph summarizing his life and career, and a paragraph summarizing why he is so great. What do you think ? __label__0 Could you please describe in more detail what do you mean? Perhaps include a drawing ? __label__0 While editing the COIN page regarding Ciplex, I accidently broke your sig. Since I don ' t want any more flame, could you please fix it ? __label__0 There seems to have been something wrong with the pages you made on the V8 Supercar Championship Series - a glitch with the "align" tags in the beginning infobox made the text grotesquely overflow the margins. I ' ve trimmed these down; mind checking my work ? __label__0 Thanks for protecting this. Perhaps no longer needed ? __label__0 Welcome to the site! Are the rims the same size on both bikes ? __label__0 Thanks for helping to source alternative names..helps quash everyone including his / her favorite. I don ' t have that ref handy--does "unofficial" mean "lots of people call it that but WMATA doesn ' t", or "it ' s often called that as a nickname even in WMATA or other formal documents"?__label__0 This is a pretty broad question to write out code for. What part of the process specifically are you having trouble with ? __label__0 are you using the webSockets API? and is this going to be open sourced at all ? __label__0 Sorry to bother you but theres a report on <url> regarding <url> which has been a target for IP vandalism. I ' m only asking directly because the vandalism is continuing and I ' m close to not being able to fight it anymore under policy so can I ask if you could please issue the protection and revert the IP ' s vandalism back to my last revision ? __label__0 Hi Emily! Do you have any ideas about a topic yet ? __label__0 My brain has been scrambled a bit by your sentence: "Essentially there is no way to distinguish between an object at rest or moving at a constant velocity." - can you elaborate please ? __label__0 @Gilles Sorry for touching such an old issue, but it looks very interesting! Do I understand it right, that something like `ionice` would do more good ? __label__0 I agree with J _ A _ X on this one. Just a suggestion though, have you thought of using Flex rotate effects to do this ? __label__0 @Mr . TAMER, I personally would like to know the latter. Would you mind to post a link for that ? __label__0 Hi Thunderbrand, thanks for letting me know that the image I uploaded is on IFD. Can I ask though, why is the image being deleted ? __label__0 You ' re welcome. And now, could you give a more detailed description of the problem ? __label__0 Please provide code and a specific question. What have you tried ? __label__0 Many thanks. I can ' t resolve "The work represents a summary of themes explored in Bacon ' s previous paintings", Tony ' s right - its clunky and unclear; any ideas ? __label__0 Do you still take photos in Jefferson Parish? If so, would it be alright if I posted some photo requests of some parish high schools ? __label__0 Okay, I will be glad to help you here! Could you please list the username you would want now ? __label__0 That ' s a good idea, and then use default parameter window = NULL? Are there other methods ? __label__0 Thank you for reverting vandalism on my page. How did you catch it so fast ? __label__0 That was a nice pic you put up in the Civil War article. where did you find it ? __label__0 Can you please show me how to do it with colorbox ? __label__0 Well, welcome, and thanks for helping out, as you can see it ' s greatly needed. Do you have <url> yet ? __label__0 Nice! Looks like a good book. Do you suppose you might be able to list some of the more advanced techniques they describe, or provide an excerpt ? __label__0 Thank you for deleting the attack page I tagged. Should <url> be blocked for creating it ? __label__0 Sorry about that, clicked on that box without thinking. Can I remove that status at this point though ? __label__0 I think we ' re not going to convince each other today. Thank you for the enjoyable debate :) Should we just agree to disagree for now ? __label__0 Number of articles on South Slavic languages is now pretty high and I ' d like to add ''Category : South Slavic languages'' as subcategory to ''Category : Slavic languages'', possibly with subcategories on individual languages. The catch is, I don ' t know how :-) -- could you point me to relevant Wiki links or start the job yourself and let me finish it ? __label__0 I also love your new CA Interstate shields. Could I trouble you to replace the current one for <url> with a similar one ? __label__0 Thanks for your comment. What was done wrong in listing the image for deletion ? __label__0 Thanks for the heads - up on that; I don ' t really have anything to add beyond what you ' d said. By the way, I noticed you said you weren ' t an admin: would you like to be ? __label__0 Thanks a lot for clearing that up. Do you also happen to know about the age of consent in Thailand, and why he could be charge with child sex offenses even though she was 17 years old ? __label__0 That ' s a very appealing recipe by the way. Do you have a cast iron waffle iron? What are you using to cook them ? __label__0 I may be missing something but I agree with @whuber. I do not see why you need an approximation g ( x) when you have h ( x)^+ and in what sense will any other function g ( x) be better than h ( x)^+?__label__0 The project page you linked provides a fairly specific overview of what the module does. Do you have specific questions about why a module would depend on it other than what they lay out there ? __label__0 No worries, thanks for doing that. Nice to hear from you again - new username for 2013 ? __label__0 I ' m sorry, but I ' m really struggling to understand what the problem is. Would you mind rephrasing the text after the first code sample ? __label__0 I ' ve finished with that category, yes. Would you like a hand clearing it ? __label__0 Sure. Can you describe such a enumeration? :)__label__0 Nice work on <url> - I had been a bit hesitant to put in those other reports, but now it looks great. How did you find out that I created it ? __label__0 Someone has Blocked the whole Opera mini Browser, as you know even i use my Mobile - Opera for editing. can you please help ? __label__0 Hey, long time no seeing! How ' s stuff ? __label__0 Sorry for inconvenience. try any help here is it an error ? __label__0 Sorry if it seems like I ' m bugging you about the above image - I ' m trying to determine the copyright holder, which needs to be specified on the image page per <url>a. When I click on the source link, I get an "access forbidden" message. Can you please specify the copyright holder on the page ? __label__0 You may want to comment on the A7 to ?2 graph with 4 lines. I suspect it is nonsense - but what are your thoughts on that folding option ? __label__0 What language is this? (apologies for ignorance, assuming C#?)__label__0 Due to certain Edits the page alignment has changed. Could you please help ? __label__0 Looks like you ' re off to a good start. What problem are you having ? __label__0 welcome to stackoverflow. what language are you trying to do this in ? __label__0 @chaman, sorry I can ' t figure out what exactly it is you want. Are we talking about the chapter title that only appears once, such as "1 Introduction" or do you want to know how to change your heading that appear on every page of the chapter ? __label__0 I don ' t think it needs the Homework tag, as even though this is homework, the question and answer would be the same regardless of the source. Do other people have to tag their questions in regards to their current occupation on the project ? __label__0 Perhaps you could explain why you believe that these *should* be related? Do you have any evidence that supports this belief ? __label__0 @bvr @chambwez I think my code is working fine now :) My last question would be, is session handling possible in XMLRPC? How do I maintain a stateful transmission between the client and the server ? __label__0 Is location important, or are you just looking for a hierarchy? I see you are going to be using "categorization by location", but are you planning on using attributes (like a lookup table) or a spatial search (like "what ' s near me")?__label__0 I ' ve clarified the question, thanks ax. @runrunraygun: What is a community wiki ? __label__0 I just thought that it is nice when you are looking for RQ that you can find an algorithm that will do RQ, not QR. It ' s fine if we just make a section about RQ in the QR article, is that ok with you ? __label__0 Is this for a one - time transaction, or something you want to be convenient for repeated use? If you use a password - based scheme, how do you plan to get the password to them ? __label__0 I think it would be excellent if you could give more detail (see suncoolsu ' s answer). Furthermore, with design, do you mean how to analyze the data ? __label__0 What type of device will be doing the dropping? ASA, IPTables, WFP, ect ? __label__0 Is there any consensus for these changes? If I ' ve missed the discussion, I do apologise, but could you post me a link to where it occurred ? __label__0 @Sky Sanders - is support for fromdate / todate on the TODO list ? If so, any idea when it will be implemented ? __label__0 I ' ve always been under the impression that most quick - sort implementations will switch to merge sort after descending a predetermined number of levels of recursion. Would you mind posting your code to see areas for improvement ? __label__0 Perhaps rephrase it to something like, "What do you look for when choosing a distribution?", or "Which distribution would best suit scenario X?"__label__0 Hi, could you provide a bit more detailed explanation with your code? The part "i need a certain area of the screen to be drawn in my app" I understood, but you could at least try to explain a bit the code you posted and give a small working example ? __label__0 This should be a pretty straightforward adaptation of the existing algorithms you linked. Can you post what you have and we can help you along with hints ? __label__0 Sorry if this is obvious, but what is `dn`? Is that a constant multiplied by `n`?__label__0 I ' d like to support iOS 3 . 0 because it ' s the project ' s requirement. Can you help ? __label__0 What would you like in the case of, e . g., `http://example . com / test . php ? key=val` ? Or `http://example . com / test . htm # section1` ?__label__0 Thanks for the answer do you know of anything I could use for the fixings with the foundations ? __label__0 @robertc - thanks for the reply. I don ' t know how to answer your question - what should I look for ? __label__0 I saw you put images for the Kings of Bhutan and thank you. Could you find an image to use for <url> also ? __label__0 @Caf, you are right. What was I thinking ? __label__0 As opposed to? What should it be instead ? __label__0 That ' s great. Did you have a question too ? __label__0 Arguably, listing the former constructors and even the template itself is not necessary. Could we please try reinstating the previous version and see if and how many other folk don ' t find the decade information useful / intriguing ? __label__0 Thanks for the info, this is enlightening. A followup question - with panniers do you find it necessary to use a pair with the content ' s weight somewhat balanced between the sides ? __label__0 I have posted a question at <url> which you may be able to answer. Can you please return to that discussion to answer it ? __label__0 I just put a table in for the novel villains (to put the novels and films on the same level), but it ' s kind of messed up (I know presscious little about tables on Wikipedia). Could you please help me fix it ? __label__0 Hey friend, you are missed on here. What ' s up ? __label__0 Is the image in the Oracle database or is it a path to the image? Could you provide a code sample ? __label__0 Thanks! There is yet another at <url>; would you agree it should be closed the same as the others ? __label__0 Yes I am planning to. Is that good ? __label__0 Crimson, there is a discussion at <url> where we have implemented a new template for bot operators when their bot is blocked stating that it is in ''no way'' an indication or accusation of wrong doing on the operator ' s behalf. I ' m sorry you have interpreted that way - would you be willing to re - consider your retirement ? __label__0 Thanks for your support! Would you consider commenting on the <url> talk page, saying it has your support (and adding those comments for discussion)?__label__0 thank you very much for your patience and for listening. how do you think is the best way to resolve these issues ? __label__0 Hi David, you ' re good with images. Anything you can do to clean up <url> so it ' s useful on ITN ? __label__0 Are you open to programmatic solutions (e . g. custom renderers), or solely OOTB methods ? __label__0 Also, on re - reading your question it is not clear what you mean by "minimum eigenvalue initial correlation matrix". Could you clarify what you mean by that term ? __label__0 Thanks for adding the WSL windmill picture. I see you are in Belgium, any chance of adding more pictures to the various lists ? __label__0 I ' m sure also. Would you show me a better way to do this ? __label__0 Thank you for correcting the error on my user page. I have a question how does one go about archiving his talk history ? __label__0 I see that countybycounty listing that you have of your travels throughout the USA. I have a county map of the USA suitable for marking for travelling (I ' ve done it for myself); would you like me to Email this user a copy of the map ? __label__0 I ' m suspecting a bad charger; most home screen I ' ve used turns itself on when you just plugged the device in or plugged the device out, if a bad charger somehow causes the device to think that it had just been plugged off and / or plugged on, it could cause the symptoms you ' re having. Have you tried with a different charger and different wall socket ? __label__0 i - o inversion is not equivalent if they assume an external magnetic field to be present. Is that the case ? __label__0 Any chance the wire between the switch and the ceiling is 200ft. long? ;p__label__0 Fine, thanks a lot. Can you please provide the link for downloading the CD cache for the ubuntu version 10 . 10 ?__label__0 Do you mean the launcher? Could you please provide a screenshot ? __label__0 Where did you get the tracklist for the album? Can you please drop me a messafe with the link ? __label__0 Hello. Can you please pass the pilot whale article ? __label__0 I ' ve gotten that and I remember it went away after a few seconds and then the app would eventually launch. Are you getting that ? __label__0 Could you clarify what you mean by #4? Does this mean that the lists of objects on each edge leading away from node _X_ are always a subset of the list of objects on the edge leading towards _X_?__label__0 Thank you ''very much'' for partaking in my effort to have a listing of stable article revisions. How do you suggest we get this project off the ground ? __label__0 Sorry Allen..Have you been able to reproduce the users problems ? do you trust the user ?__label__0 Not what ' s commonly observed -- on the contrary an often heard complaint is that `print` statements from various threads get all mixed up. What platform, OS and version, Python version, etc ? __label__0 I ' m an admin, I ' d be happy to do it. You want me to do it now ? __label__0 Hi Asbestos! This is kind of weird for me but I see that you are a participant in the photo project and list yourself as a photographer in Edinburgh and I was wondering if there was any possibility that you would be willing to respond to my recent request <url>?__label__0 <url> is based at 340 Laurier Avenue West Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0P9 - It doesn ' t have a photo posted yet. Is this convenient for you ? __label__0 What do you have in mind with "Algorithmic approaches"? I gave some examples of applications in my answer, is that what you are looking for ? __label__0 Welcome to WikiProject Austria. I ' m wondering if you ' re willing to coordinate the project for a while ? __label__0 Thankyou - best answer so far! Did you buy these shoes so you could ride in to work and wear them all day? or did you not fancy any of the 'Shimano golf shoes'?__label__0 Thanks for improving the article. Can you add categories also ? __label__0 Interesting question. I wonder if there might be a difference between fresh and dried pasta ? __label__0 What is an eastern style pot? Is this a cup - like device with a lid to strain out the leaves (sorry, don ' t know the name), or something else entirely ? __label__0 The solution reported in the issue report is to replace any occurrence of `unset($form[$id])` with `$form[$id] = array('#language' => NULL)` in the module file; it just a matter of doing a "search and replace" on a file. What do you exactly don ' t understand ? __label__0 Seeing you back on Wikipedia after a long time. How are you doing, and is everyone you know safe ? __label__0 Hello again. Could you move this to <url>, please ? __label__0 Marhaba Tiamut. <url> has grown quite a bit since last week, and we ' re planning to take it to GA, would you be interested in joining the push ? __label__0 I was looking for some help with editing portals, I ' ve read up on some stuff but still don ' t quite understand. Do you think you could help me ? __label__0 Hello, I am interested in helping out with <url> and <url>, but the pages are very very long, which is unmanageable and discouraging. Could you please break them up into (many) smaller subpages ? __label__0 I don ' t think this is possible as written. When N is very large, the expected product of widely separated xi must be very close to zero, and we can find a set of 1 / p + 1 that must essentially be mutually exclusive despite all having probability p. Perhaps you meant E [ xi xj] - p^2 = .. ?__label__0 Thanks. are you suggesting that might be the source of my problem, or is just a general best practice ? __label__0 In short, based on the sparse information provided by outsiders, I would like to work constructively with you (and others) to whip the article into shape, as its presence seems warranted but the article is unlikely to garner necessary details from random contributors. What shall I do next ? __label__0 Well, lyrics are generally frowned upon on Wikipedia, unless the song is old enough that its copyright no longer applies. Could you perhaps link to the article ? __label__0 @GoodEnough It ' s not about other people reading your mail but about giving Google all your data. You now, *Do be evil* (or how was their slogan?).__label__0 Okay thanks I ' ll try it! DId you choose the pictures yourself ? __label__0 This is a cool question! Where did this come up ? __label__0 @JK, Welcome to Stack Overflow! Could you tell us what your thought process has been on this problem so far ? __label__0 Hi Steve, I ' ve added refs & cites to this article. Do you think it still needs a warning about lack of refs / citations ? __label__0 I really like the template you used at <url> but it dosen ' t seem to exist on the WP : Vandalism page. Where can I grab it ? __label__0 Thank you so much! I hope it ' s allright if I move it to my front page, at least when the talk has to be archived ? __label__0 Please post the actual compiler message. Does the error occur with minimal source files (just the mentioned lines without the stuff implied by ..)?__label__0 Ah, well, I forgot that I also did subclass the view object associated with my NSCollectionViewItem subclass while I was working on this today. Perhaps that broke something ? __label__0 Some time ago, you uploaded separate maps for each town and unincorporated community in <url>. Do you have similar maps for any other counties, or a town - level map of the entire state ? __label__0 Hello, I ' m with the project of turning the list <url> hat is the same list in English, but in another language, and more link for azure. I have a problem, <url>, could you help me ? __label__0 And then in addition to image tags and metadata, Lightroom stores a history of *edits* such as color tweaks, crops, and all that. Where are those stored ? __label__0 I ' m sorry, I ' m having trouble understanding your question. Could you try again ? __label__0 Which little tag are you referring to? As for your second question, that does depend on a couple of things- you can send it through the official OTRS address, if you like, and someone will get to you in due course, but you ' re welcome to forward the email to me personally at jmilburninfaerun AT gmail . com, and I ' ll take a look at it for you, and upload the image / explain why it ' s not possible ? __label__0 Sorry for the slow reply, something I needed to take care of. <url> is restored- if it is mentioned in such <url>, could you please <url> them in the article ? __label__0 Your new map is a great, less distorting, format, but it leaves out a whole lot of countries that have recently joined the alliance - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia etc among them. Can you fix this please ? __label__0 Good point Dan. instead of the OK / Cancel stuff, have you (user583126) considered a < noscript > solution ? __label__0 Can you clarify? What ' s the list supposed to contain ? __label__0 +1 - very welcome update for an inspiring simple yet really entertaining game; given your new employment I ' ve long expected this transition, free - time project or not ;) One question though: why do you have to 'add / enable' new sites? Having a threshold in place should allow for this to happen automatically in principle, no ? __label__0 Nice.. you have almost give us enough details, last question. What is that `System . out . println ( e . getCause().toString());` call printing ? __label__0 I ' d be glad to help, if you like. How should we divide it, by section or by criteria ? __label__0 Hey, I saw you edited the Dark Tower Series page. I was just wondering if you were a fan of the series ? __label__0 Thanks again. Do you have any suggestions for how we might change the article to take the practical side of this into account with being (a) inaccurate or (b) overly technical ? __label__0 I would like to nominate you so that you could become an administrator. Would you accept or not ? __label__0 I ' d be more than happy to :) It may take a while as I ' ve got other stuff on, but as long as you ' re in no immediate hurry all should be well. Do you have any preferences / requirements for the end result ? __label__0 Ozan asks a good question below. Out of curiosity, is this just a logic puzzle, or is there a reason someone would need to avoid basic language constructs ? __label__0 I think the question could bring some good answers. But maybe it ' s more fitting to make it a CW ? __label__0 Hey there, just curious if the changes made to the GA Nomination for Dan Brouthers were sufficient for pass. If not ready for pass, anything else I can do to expedite the process ? __label__0 Great Article RaveenS, Do u want me to add this to the template (Sri Lankan Conflict)? I think it should be included in the ''see also'' section what do you suggest ? __label__0 Thank you for caring re: my loss. We go on, because it ' s all we can ever do, y ' know ? __label__0 Hi, thanks for your help. There is also this sentence "Asukkaista 84 , 5% oli ruotsinkielisixe4 ja 15 , 4% suomenkielisixe4 vuonna 1970 ja kunta oli kaksikielinen." What does it mean, please ? __label__0 A little while back, at the beginning of November, I had said that if you ever were considering adminship, that I would love to support and / or nominate you. Do you have any interest in pursuing it ? __label__0 Nice question!. Which specific terms do you understand and which ones do you not understand ? __label__0 Nice work so far on your rewrite of "The One After the Superbowl". Are you planning on including info about the Diet Coke fiasco ? __label__0 it is exactly what I want. please how can I do this ?__label__0 Hello Narendra. What is your question, exactly ? __label__0 I was at the library today looking through the back issues of ''Mojo'' and found a career - spanning Chili Peppers article from 2004. I read most of it, but I can go back next week and cite from it. Is there anything you want me to look for ? __label__0 Yeah, it ' s difficult to tell what the columns mean from their names. Can you add more explanation of how the tables fit together ? __label__0 Thanks for your response! How should we proceed ?__label__0 On a related note, I went through your recent article - work, and saw nothing wrong with your contributions. I was wondering, would you like me to grant your account <url> to make it easier to revert vandalism when you come across it ? __label__0 Thanks a lot steve, I ' m trying to implement the pseudo - code line by line very carefully, there is an extended pseudo - code that ' s written more clearly here: http://ww . wpi . edu / Pubs / ETD / Available / etd - 0430102 - 11906 / unrestricted / corourke . pdf on page 27, I ' m coding that carefully and i ' m testing it with some sample answers given by NTRU, I think i ' m also getting held back in understanding the pseudo - code, in my code I gave a fixed length and set of values to the polynomial f, and the infinite loop on 8 - 31 never ended, thanks for pointing out that f is a variable. Any more tricks to watch out for ? __label__0 Just looking at it, it looks like a skewed normal distribution. Are you sure the outliers are necessary for your analysis ? __label__0 Hello, Ruben; welcome on _Drupal Answers_. For which Drupal version are you asking the question ? __label__0 bring what back? how are bluetooth and killing processes related ? __label__0 I believe that almost all jQuery plugins can work with a ListView. Could you show any code where you attempt to use gallery with a ListView ? __label__0 Perhaps this is not a good candidate for binding to a property grid. Can you set the property, save the result, have that return instantly, and then later on, based on some user action, run your long - running operation ? __label__0 how you show imges from lazyload in listview ' s image ? can you post your code please ?__label__0 Thank you for your input in my article on Iowa State Track and Field! I am trying to improve the article more and wondered if you could look at it and make suggestions that may improve the current content ? __label__0 @TLP thanks for the explanation. So `\@returned` is `$data _ structure _ reference`, right ? __label__0 @zildjohn01, What ' s the best way to do this (which PHP functions?). Could you leave a detailed answer with your approach ? __label__0 Your <url> is a brilliant idea! Would you mind if I linked to it from my collection of "Useful things" on my user page ? __label__0 Yes, this is a nice illustration. I ' d love to have a look of the code; is it possible for you to mail it to me ? __label__0 Hey Nick, thanks for writing the book reviews! Would you like me to run one or both of them ? __label__0 I ' m sure there is a way to tackle this problem, but we ' ll need more information. Can you try explaining the issue a bit more thoroughly ? __label__0 Ah, okay. Perhaps you can edit your original question and add that extra info in there ? __label__0 Sorry about that, yes it is a taxonomy page then. The code I posted above using get _ terms() was working so that means your code should work too right ? __label__0 Thank you! Could you protect the picture that ' s live too ? __label__0 this seems like an interesting question, but I can ' t make heads or tails of it. Do you think you could edit it to explain in more depth, perhaps including links to some of the more technical terms ? __label__0 Nice. What SVG editor did you use ? __label__0 Hi Johnuniq, thank you for your edit. Does the file should be deleted / removed from commons then ? __label__0 Presumably the CfD will be inconclusive. Given the technical issues, perhaps an RfC might be more helpful ? __label__0 Thanks for adding that ref to <url>. I don ' t suppose your copy of Conway ' s says anything about the roles and fates of ''Schleswig - Holstein'' or ''Schleisen''?__label__0 Thank you very much for your kind comments but I don ' t recall if or when I made these contributions. Are you sure it was me ? __label__0 Thanks. Aside from rewrites and creations (which I ' ve no mind for), anything in particular you see that I should focus on, or is it going okay ? __label__0 Can you elaborate? An example maybe ? __label__0 Thanks for the redactions :). Is it worth getting a third opinion at the reliable sources noticeboard vis a vis the use of law textbooks for points of law ? __label__0 Thanks. And, what about the <url> about "he drowned" not being reflexive in Spanish ? __label__0 @user052211 Glad to hear you got it sorted out. Would you mind posting your solution as an answer so that other developers can reference it if they run into a similar problem ? __label__0 Thanks very much for your edit to the <url> article. Would you be interested in tackling the <url> of <url>?__label__0 I am not sure I fully understand the question, is it like having to make 2 piles of different units that will be the closest in total construction time ? With the only constraint that piles cannot exceed 5 elements ? __label__0 What are you trying to say? You want a Registry Editor ? __label__0 Hi, I ' d like to help you with the image you just uploaded to the <url> article. Can you tell me where you found it ? __label__0 Hi Skully, I ' ve been keeping an eye on your edits over the past few weeks, and I think you should be a admin. Is it alright if I nominated you to be an admin ? __label__0 Since you mentioned Evil Maid by Joanna, you already know the answer to your question. Am I missing something here ? __label__0 The Smalltalk one? The CLOS one ? __label__0 Hi Vikas, is there any special way to accept the answers? Do i have to send any mail or click on any link to accept the answers ? __label__0 The very easiest way to tag an image is to use the Alt Text in picture ' s properties, but I have a feeling this isn ' t what you want based on your example. Can you describe more about not only what you want but how you plan to achieve it ? __label__0 An IP is complaining that I ' m violating policy by removing unlinked nonnotable band members from the notable natives and residents section of <url>. Can you help me please ? __label__0 Thanks. Before I use, is there are way to deny the bot only within a portion of an article rather than the entire article ? __label__0 Hi, I just couldn ' t understand <url> ! Could you explain , please ?__label__0 in certain cases i had to first start the Zune player and then VS2010 to make it work. Perhaps that does the trick for you ? __label__0 I was thinking about creating a page about Nintendo eShop. And since you are a well trusted user I am asking you if you think that would just be deleted because there isn ' t enough information ? __label__0 Is the new draft at <url> OK with you? Do you have any comments or suggestions ? __label__0 Thanks for your answer. Could you expand on what 2 hot wires are? Does that mean 2 live wires ? __label__0 Thanks for nuking that thing. While the page was still present, someone opened an <url>..could you please close it ? __label__0 I found [this little recipe](http://code . activestate . com / recipes / 576420 - get - a - posix - timestamp - from - a - type - 1 - uuid/) in Python. Since I ' m not good at Ruby, could someone make this for Ruby please ? __label__0 Happy belated birthday to you too! How have you been ? __label__0 I ' m not sure what the distinction is that you ' re making. What do you want to store, and how do you want to retrieve it ? __label__0 Thanks, Dimitry. I responded on the other board as well, but do you have any samples of a wrapper - based timer that I can use ? __label__0 In general, the first field on a line can be empty, in which case it could start with a comma. So, how do you know when the lines need to be combined ? __label__0 Sure, no problem. Jestes z Warszawy ? __label__0 Hey, I could really use your skill on WikiProject Cities. Do you have time to assist ? __label__0 This sounds like an open ended hardware request, which is likely to get your question closed. Can you make your question any more specific ? __label__0 There are lots and lots of rational fraction libraries. What language would you like to know about ? __label__0 Maybe it ' s better just to ask and to provide some rules like: one suggestion per answer, use voting on exisiting ones. Or is this the meaning of community wiki already ? __label__0 I ' ll unblock you if you give me some confirmation you ' ve understood this and you are prepared to discuss the article through the proper channels, calmly and politely. So, cool down please, okay ? __label__0 Just curious. Does the ''tab'' key move your cursor to the search box ? __label__0 Apologies, I was busy prod ' ding this article when you speedily deleted it, so I inadvertently re - created it. Can you delete it again, please ? __label__0 That is, I would remove the inline reference to the date of the cited source, since it ' s given in the actual footnote. Is that OK with you ? __label__0 When we go to the American Indian museum, they would like our real name ahead of time that way they can get us through security quickly. Could you get yours to me by tomorrow, either via the page for the meetup, my talk page or an e - mail ? __label__0 @Rob Fox, thanks! BTW, why won ' t you post it as an answer? ;)__label__0 I ' m always happy to give a second opinion on ID - you ' re welcome to put images on my talk page to discuss them. Regarding <url>, I would tend to go with ''<url>'', what do you think ? __label__0 I like your idea of relativ dimensions and positions. What didn ' t work well ? __label__0 Thanks for the response. May I ask, are you a video gamer ? __label__0 Thank you for the rollback. Does it appear in <url> or only in the history ? __label__0 another great example for how google makes you stupid. does nobody ever read the documentation anymore ? __label__0 Yeah, thank you so much. Can anyone do that or only admins ? __label__0 Some otherwise useless kitchen gadgets might have other valid uses. I never use a garlic press (just another thing to clean, when I can crush it with the side of my knife), but they can make play - doh hair (or really small noodles?)__label__0 Thank you, Cremepuff22, for the kind words. :) How have you been ? __label__0 I ' m sorry, I don ' t know what article you are talking about. Can you please provide the exact name ? __label__0 I seem to have adopted this article, since country music and dance are interests of mine. Can you recommend an easy to use bot that would help me in keeping those unwanted links out of the article ? __label__0 I hope this makes my concerns clearer. Perhaps we can work together to resolve them ? __label__0 You ' re brilliant. Thanks :) Now could you just tell me how to make the view show the fields as rows, not columns ? __label__0 Its related to an algorithm for finding unique sets of a given number of items, so I just wanted to know if that had a name or if I was already looking at it. Is my question still off topic ? __label__0  " Google says they generally don ' t like pages with more than 100 links on them" -- out of curiosity what is your source on this? can you cite it in the post in a hyperlink ? __label__0 Thanks for the articles on South African cricket teams - I was planning to do them myself but I really appreciate that you ' ve done them. By the way, where did you find the information on what regions the teams represent ? __label__0 I appreciate your effort to seek consensus through a merge proposal before merging <url> to <url>, but as you are no doubt aware, no one participated in the discussion, meaning that while there was no articulated consensus against it, there was also no consensus for it. May I recommend undoing the merge for now, re - opening the discussion, and seeking wider input at the relatively large number of WikiProjects that handle those articles ? __label__0 Hi! What would you like help with in particular ? __label__0 I think that ' s a good solution. Should we give it a try ? __label__0 You try thinking of algorithms (either new ones or ones you know) that satisfy the constraint, discarding the ones that don ' t. :-) Do you have specific examples ? __label__0 Well, solution non - withstanding, the news - story you linked to was great read. Some people, huh? :)__label__0 I ' ve nominated a biology - type article, <url>, at <url>. Would you be interested in reviewing it ? __label__0 No problem. Have you heard anything new about HRE ? __label__0 Sorry for the delay in responding. The problems seems to have calmed down at this point, is that correct ? __label__0 Please see <url>. Can you help ? __label__0 Thank you for the response on my user page. Would you be willing to add a few words to the FAC candidacy ? __label__0 Thanks for the cleanup. Why did you delink the songs and Weird Al ' s album ? __label__0 Note that this fix is only for the US Captivate and Vibrant Galaxy S variants. Presumably Samsung are releasing this as a stop - gap until they (or the networks) get round to releasing 2 . 2 for those Galaxy S variants ? __label__0 I ' ve never heard that. Any links to horror stories ? __label__0 It depends on what you are cooking with the egg, because they have a few different roles in a dish. Can you provide more information on which dish you are cooking where you want to replace the egg ? __label__0 Please read this again: "you can use the amount of time it takes for it to invalidate you help guess if part of your credentials are correct". Aren ' t you missing something there ? __label__0 I have just put the article to peer review. Would you care to take a look ? __label__0 Excellent, thanks! I wonder if it ' s worth temporarily uploading a cropped image for the main page, as 100x100 is really very small ? __label__0 Ah, thanks! Btw, IS THERE any kind of guideline for FAs in regard to lede length somewhere ? __label__0 If you prepare slightly smaller images, I ' ll insert them in your question. Also, what ' s that thing with truncated titles in your screenshots ? __label__0 I agree, how did you come up with the problem in the first place? I would have thought the idea for a thesis would have come from a real world problem that needs solving ? __label__0 ^^ Yes it is very much for my self learning. Can you please guide me as to how to go about with the approach ? __label__0 I am good at that ;-). You know about the new "Oversight" priv ? __label__0 Thanks for change to Hugh de Grandmesnil - I am (It is) very short of refs for that article. Could you suggest one for your addition ? __label__0 Did you ever get this resolved successfully? Do you still need help with this ? __label__0 It could simply be that the previous owner of your domain had questionable content. Did you dig wayback / cache to check ? __label__0 Other than a missing declaration of 'ss', the code you ' ve provided will get the address of a member of a structure. Can you provide more detail on what isn ' t working for you ? __label__0 Thank you for the tip Javier. As I ' ve never done a FL before, can you take a look after I ' ve completed the list ? __label__0 Is the array supposed to be dynamic? i . e. you can update the array after the pre - process step ? __label__0 So how on earth do I overwrite the existing files without deleting all of the custom content? (CSS, markup, etc?)__label__0 I ' d be happy to. Can you tell me how ? __label__0 Thanks @BMitch, would you suggest the spray insulation (sorry not sure of the correct term). Or would that be too compact and not work for sound proofing ? __label__0 +1, awesome problem. BTW, do you mean "You have %d unread messages"?__label__0 Your comments have been extremely helpful. I ' d like to put this FAC to bed soon; is there any chance that you might be able to finish off your review of the article this weekend ? __label__0 I like yours better, it ' s less demeaning. This is pretty new to me.. should I remove it or leave it ? __label__0 Thank you for taking the time to review my nomination of <url> as a featured article candidate. I have responded to the issues you raised in <url> - could you please review my replies and let me know if you ' re satisfied ? __label__0 Hey, I saw your article on the ''Mosambique'' in the Good New Article search results and looked at your other contributions, and I see that you do a lot on naval history. Would you be interested in helping me to expand <url>?__label__0 I saw your notes, and will watch for any objections. If there are none, in two days, do you mind if I move that page and start the new categorization page / discussion ? __label__0 So you mean you just can ' t use date functions, yes? Presumably comparison, multiplication and subtraction are okay? :-)__label__0 You might want to add more context to the question (although it ' s been fairly well answered below :-) I . e. why do you want to do this ? __label__0 I guess you could have mis - typed the name of the textbox control. Is it TextBox1? :)__label__0 Good job, great article. Where did you get the idea, out of curiosity ? __label__0 Hi @OZ_ - can you educate me as to why? Is there a better way to store images ? __label__0 Thank you for your Wikignome - like edits. What do you think, substantively ? __label__0 It would really help the many viewers of this question if you would edit it to be clear without having to follow links. And what is DPAPT ? __label__0 @adatapost great! however, do you mean APIs / sites that you can reference from your site (such as Google Analytics), sites where you upload your logs to, or both? :)__label__0 I agree, The question is almost claiming that you can ' t debug with a debugger in an IDE this is not the case. You can run a debugger with or without an IDE, I ' m sure he knows that though :) Maybe he is asking about visual debuggers specificly ? __label__0 Hello Sirmyles, I noticed a puzzling section on <url> that could only have been written by you (about the parallels with Shiite law). I would appreciate if you could identify a source that could possibly support this assertion ? __label__0 Currently, <url> is a subcategory of <url>. What would you suggest doing about this ? __label__0 Yes, that is the real source code. And the compilation has been performed without optimization, perhaps that is the reason ? __label__0 Can you explain your scenario better? Perhaps with an example ? __label__0 ..welcome back! Is this permanent, or are you just passing through ? __label__0 Maybe show some code and / or image examples. If compatibility is important, have you considered using an animated GIF ? __label__0 Welcome to Bicycles . SE! Your question is quite similar to [What are the utmost important things to bring on a ride?- Is there anything you ' re looking to find out that ' s not already addressed in this earlier question ? __label__0 This is helpful for automatized transfer scripts. By the way, did I get the location tag right on <url> :-) ?__label__0 Thank you for your kind comment. Do you have a suggestion where the portals should be placed in the article ? __label__0 I ' d be shocked if no one has asked you this yet, but you do an enormous amount of work keeping the bio articles free of vandalism and nonsense as well as filling them up with useful content ;) You seem like you could use a few extra buttons on your toolbar. Are you interested in being nominated for adminship ? __label__0 I am looking for help improving the dermatology content on wikipedia. Would you be willing to help, or do you have any friends interested in derm that would be interested in helping ? __label__0 I don ' t know of a specific resource, but if you have specific questions I may be able to help a little. Are you using WER ? __label__0 I was wondering if you ' d like me to make your userboxes (on your userpage) line up horizontally (in columns of 3) rather than vertically. Interested ? __label__0 Thanks, I didn ' t notice the earlier discussion. Would you consider (if you haven ' t done so yet) adding some indication on either page that these are the same user ? __label__0 Thank you very much for your comment! Could you help to mention an example of debugger helper ? __label__0 @Firebrandt: Could you, please, add the clarification what you meant by better in your question.

Could you move <url> to <url> as well ? __label__0 Hi 72Dino, I was going over the talk page for vector when I re - read that you had found a tax document for '09 regarding discussion on Vector ' s contributions to the charity fund. Could you please provide a link for my personal review of that Document ? __label__0 thanks for your input, it was such a pleasure interacting with you, now that the overlapping projects assessment are done, we need never interact again. projects opting out of policy, how charming, some projects are more equal than others, can i take a vote on SI project opting out of copyright vios ? __label__0 Great work you ' ve been doing on this. Would you agree with me that International Political Economy should be capitalised ? __label__0 Sure thing, you ' ve been doing great work so far. Would it help to maybe translate the whole article first as it is, and then over the course of time you can play around with the sections and add stuff that you find ? __label__0 Thanks for the heads up, I don ' t think they will succeed but it ' s good to know they ' re planning it. Did you let Jayjg know as well ? __label__0 native? You compile to the microcode for your particular processor or the generic x86 instruction set ? __label__0 Thank you, after some experimenting, this seems to be the way to go. Any thoughts on how to move the reparented component back to its original place in DOM (and ExtJS component hierarchy) once the window is closed ? __label__0 Done. I may have missed a few links when copying them across, so could you please look through it just in case ? __label__0 Thanks! What type of documentation do you want u2014 an explanation of using the notes feature ? __label__0 Thank you. Was it anything in particular ? __label__0 thanks for the welcome! I have a question.. how come you can ' t edit the article about Whales ? __label__0 Thanks for help! One more question: similar item at this address is a painting: http://sflib1 . sfpl . org : 82 / record=b1035824~S0 Do I use the same tags ? __label__0 I think we need a bit more context here. Exactly what type of graph do you want ? __label__0 Thanks for blocking this user -- he promptly erased the warnings on his talk page (I put them back). I guess a block doesn ' t automatically block the talk page, huh ? __label__0 Hi Leah, is it working again? I had some difficulties with WP in general a couple of days ago and was wondering if your issues had the same origin ? __label__0 Thanks a ton for looking that up for me. For the purposes of a citation, what are the page numbers for the whole article ? __label__0 @Dave Long: Thanks, great! Would you know what the name of that command is, in Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Keyboard ? __label__0 Generally, I ' d anticipate a code bug. Can you paste in your FD _ SET and your select calls please ? __label__0 I see you ' ve done a lot of work on hospital - related articles, especially in Oregon.

Can you help with the phonetics of other Nordic languages ? __label__0 Welcome to SO. What is a Try It Editor ? __label__0 Thanks for adding that pmc= support to <url>. I made a suggestion for further improvement in <url>; can you please follow up there if you have the time ? __label__0 Sorry I didn ' t mentioned it, but it ' s tab separated.. It is possible to quickly replace the ',' by a '.' in the code or do I have to replace it with notepad++ or something ? __label__0 Wow, that is a great answer! Thanks for the answer. One more question for you though. How can I tell what the float of the pedal is ? __label__0 All is good here, hopefully the same with yourself. How many English first - class cricketer you think we ' ve got to get done in total ? __label__0 Could you do me a huge favour, but only if you want to, because I know it ' s a lot to ask.

I edited a couple of things and added a few images..could you reply your opinion please ? __label__0 I ' ve made some changes to the <url>, and started a discussion on the template talk page.

Sounds ok to you ? __label__0 I ' m trying to install Lupin / Anti - vandal tool, but im stuck. Could you help please ? __label__0 When displayed, the menu link will use the defined path alias. Any reason why this isn ' t enough ? __label__0 Many thanks for your correction on that article. I ' ve been meaning to expand the content, but this might be quicker to address in the short term: I think it may be better to change "consisting of" to "composed of," based on reading some stuff from your user page - thoughts ? __label__0 Sounds similar to this problem: http://cooking . stackexchange . com / questions / 6433 / why - does - my - velveeta - queso - dip - get - clumpier - the - longer - it - stays - in - the - microwave I guess Velvetta isn ' t designed to be microwaved ? __label__0 I noticed you ' re setting up s - line for DART but having trouble with the termini.

Is there a way to do so ?__label__0 Greetings, sorry to bother you here.. I have been using the MissingTopics tool for years, to generate <url> The last time I used it successfully was Nov 16. Something must have changed in the algorhythms since then, because it will no longer read any page starting with an Amharic character.. Is it broke ? __label__0 Thank you for your answer. For the acidic rub, do you mean like lemon juice? Or more like yoghurt to permeate / tenderize the meat ? __label__0 I have the same issue.. This has worked for me in the past.

I don ' t suppose you could put copyright and source information on those images, though ? __label__0 What have you tried so far? What problems have you encountered ? __label__0 Hi, I think that the best algorithm depends on the number of the teams. How many should they be ? __label__0 Ok, that ' s no problem.

To which Drupal version are you interested ? __label__0 I ' m leaving radiant / nescott to you. Can I ask you to look at my report of UBeR, please ? __label__0 I ' m sorry, I don ' t understand your question. Maybe you could post a sample of the code that works properly, and the code that doesn ' t ? __label__0 FYI, I found a unit representative, I think, see <url>. I directed him to your draft for the military reps, would you mind supporting him if you need, I am kindof wrapped up in several different things off wiki and on ? __label__0 Sure thing, and thank you for noticing! Is the colour better now ? __label__0 Yes it does, but the weird thing it ' s that all the other user attributes are getting passed (When i take a look at the console, every other value but the client _ id hash it ' s getting passed from the form). Do you think that the fact that I ' m also using authlogic for this same model may be something to do with it ? __label__0 That ' s what I thought. :) Well, what is solution for safe managing lua _ State*?__label__0 I will understand if you decline, but would very much like you to accept.

Do you know of anything like that ? __label__0 Let me know when ' s convenient and I ' ll put the kettle on. Tea or coffee ? __label__0 Cool, Thanks, do you want to add it to their list? or can I ? __label__0 Seems very similar to http://security . stackexchange . com / questions / 1634 / which - instant - messaging - services - use - or - allow - secure - protocols - and - what - do - those - but there may be a slightly different goal here. @LanceBaynes - Could you elaborate a bit, particularly in a way that distinguishes this question from the other ? __label__0 The reason for using "Please try not to eat the semicolon" was simply because I couldn ' t come up with a better example. Would there be any difference if it was related ? __label__0 Yeah, I didn ' t cover the why, but it ' s a good question. Maybe they need to add some kind of searching "engine" or something.. but where are they going to get one of those ? __label__0 Hate to be a bother.. but need help with getting the bot running? Anything I can do as a non programmer ? __label__0 @Kosmonaut: Yes please, I agree with Martha. What is the deal with W ?__label__0 Thanks for your help on this, it ' s much appreciated.

Would you like me to try to mediate the Karsh page ? __label__1 Since working on the article you wrote, I have become fascinated with this band. Is any of their music availabe online ? __label__1 Did you try writing something in an attempt to implement this? If so, what happens when you run it ? __label__1 Do you always start from 0 , 0 (or the bottom - left - most point)? Or can you start from any point ? __label__1 I was thinking that it would be appropriate to <url> <url> for the front page on April 16th, 2008, the one - year anniversary of the event. What do you think about that ? __label__1 To clarify the question: You have (say) 5 schedules and 10 meetings, each with 5+ non - overlapping meeting times, and you want all 5 schedules to contain all 10 meetings, with no overlapping times in any one schedule. Is this correct ? __label__1 This worked for me the other day. Are you sure it happens for EVERY site you try to post a link to ? __label__1 I don ' t know if I understand correctly: Do you want to add a new image tag to your div tag? Where do you have your list ? __label__1 I ' ve never seen a key between Shift and Z either. Could that be European thing ? __label__1 Out of curiosity what are you testing? How are things going ? __label__1 What operating system? Are you writing a debugger or trying to use a debugger ? __label__1 I noticed, that for users warned before, Huggle still uses level 1 warning.

That ' s not the same, is it ? __label__1 When I see status with Firebus ' s Net Tab then it shows me Status 200. Is it right ? __label__1 Hi, not sure exactly what you are asking, the three web refs you list (IUCN, Birdlife, Audubon) all work fine for me, possible a server might have been down temporally, since these rarely give trouble otherwise? Or have I misunderstood your question ? __label__1 @Mike Chen Could you, please, explain what is $C_=P$? And what do you mean by the "counting of topological sorts"?__label__1 you already release FootballScoreBoardViewController. Can you show your code ?__label__1 Thanks. Does it happen to say anything about his marriage to Paula, as in when it ended ? __label__1 This question is a forum - style post, looking to start a discussion and not ask a specific question. Can yo be more specific about what you need to know about patch kits, or indicate what problem you ' re looking to solve ? __label__1 I am sorry, got confused on who created this article. :-/ Apologies ? __label__1 Very true. Out of interest, what do you make of the new kits ( s)?__label__1 Why community wiki? Isn ' t it expertise to show that you know a cool website dedicated to latex templates ? __label__1 I ' m also having to use your link. Perhaps we should change the main page link to use the megaupload until we know that the main website is up ? __label__1 Just musing on creating an article about the formation of the Pixies (I reckon I could write a decent - sized article on the whole thing). What are your thoughts ? __label__1 The "standard work" on Introduction to.. articles is presently <url>, maybe you could add your thoughts as some kind of appendix / discussion? I don ' t know what the procedure is for essays, single author of Wiki - style ? __label__1 I would open a separate question about the vectorization. Have you tried just using yindex (removing the [y] and the while loop)?__label__1 If it were me I ' d want to try and find out more about how / why this happened first before I continued to use that software. Have you asked at the talk page I mentioned above ? __label__1 I can ' t understand you. Can you show an example ? __label__1 I was actually going to work on your suggestions today, regarding the GA nomination for <url>. Do you mind reopening the nomination ? __label__1 I ' ve created <person> to deal with the new CSD A8, deletion of blatant copyvios. Mind to take a look and tell me if there ' s anything wrong with it ? __label__1 comp . graphics . algorithms FAQ, questions 4 . 02 and 4 . 03. In what language are you looking for a library ? __label__1 Hi again! Per your <url>, I ' ll leave questions here, which actually leads me to a question, hehe; why would you want users to bring RfA discussion to your talk page rather than keeping it in a centralised viewable location on the RfA page where users are encouraged to submit questions for optional response by the candidate ? __label__1 Yes, but is "getting away" with it the best choice? What about ethics in GIS ? __label__1  ( sorry for delayed response) I think it would be difficult to intergrate them, my program would probably work more easily from a list of articles with typos generated from the database, with the spelling correction code built in to the program. While on the subject, are you planning on running Humanbot again soon ? __label__1 The <url> page said that <url> will be shown on the <url> subchannels 26 . 5 and 26 . 6, and also on analog channel 48. It is also expected that The U Too will displace Me Too from analog channel 48. If that ' s the case, then, where do you suppose Me Too will end up? What new channel in Chicago will it be shown on ? __label__1 Yep, no worries. What ' s the article ? __label__1 its - it ' s - its - Sheesh ! Thanks for fixing :-) Scary, huh ? __label__1 I need to read more about what exactly a pastoral opera is supposed to be. Perhaps it should be a supercategory ? __label__1 Are you writing a kakuro / sudoku solver? If so, do you have restraints on the possible values, such as always 1 - 9, there are always at most 9 sets, that sort of thing ? __label__1 Hi, do you mind if I move your hook to go live on 26 / 27th? The GLAM WIKI conference could do with being highlighed by a non US / UK hook ? __label__1 You beat me to the punch with the archaeological discovery.<url>. I ' m curious, do you know if any Scottish newspapers reported it ? __label__1 Okay, so you just want to get a feel for what ' s out there, and know you want CCK - like functionality. Any other specific features you ' re looking for, or aspects of Drupal that you ' d like to avoid ? __label__1 I am sorry, I am just a first year math student. Could you please provide / recommend a link / book / paper that describes how the relationship was derived ? __label__1 Do you mean the font size of a TTY, or of a terminal within X? If the latter, which terminal emulator ? __label__1 Sorry, I didn ' t know. I added a tag, are you able to delete it ? __label__1 seems like gettimeofday issue on linux. maybe your kernel has some extra configurations for timer ? __label__1 Since you are using a process supervisor, you should not need pid files. Can you configure apache2 and postgres not to create them ? __label__1 Could you please be more specific? Which paragraphs from the [link](http://reactivated . net / writing _ udev _ rules . html) are relevant to me ? __label__1 I will readily grant that. But where was the urgent reason not to follow it in any of the above cases ? __label__1 @Zoozy: As Andrew asked, What led you to this problem? What are the practical uses of such a sequence ? __label__1 The FLC reviewing process is much slower than I imagined it would be but I suspect the Oscar nominees are bound to get promoted soon. In the meantime, would you be interested in helping turn <url> into something like <url>?__label__1 Can you clarify? Do you want a substring that ' s complement also occurs in the string ? __label__1 Strange. Do gems without native extensions load ok ? __label__1 Hey, ehlep me you can with the finding of a source to prove that Sidney Kimmel and Jimmy Kimmels relationsio if you have any time??__label__1 After ''New Jersey'' leaves the mainpage it will be nessicary for us to check all the article linked to USS ''New Jersey'' and ensure that no subtle vandalism crept into them by means of the USS ''New Jersey'' article. Are you willing to help ? __label__1 Did you ever get this resolved successfully? Do you still need help with this ? __label__1 Please explain the kind of statistics you are trying to gather. Is it just number of loads or urls or is there some callback info you want when the user is using your widget ? __label__1 Your regexp is probably dropping the newline character that is present on each of your input strings. Can you post the regexp that you are using ? __label__1 I try to sort the array firstly with O ( nlogn) and then find the minimal window with O ( n). I just wonder is there a better method ? __label__1 Hey I saw that you ' re using Huggle and wanted to try it out, too. I downloaded it, but every time I try to open the program I get the message: CLR error: 8004005. The program will now terminate..What can I do to fix the problem ? __label__1 `ps -ef` shows all foreground processes for me. Which OS are you running on ? __label__1 I got the page fixed. Sorry I had to do it several times on the page but it wouldn ' t let me revert it to before the IP user vandalized it how do you do that ? __label__1 <person> is apparently caught up in that rangeblock. Can you help him out ? __label__1 Is 10 months sufficient time to relist a AFD? Not too soon, correct ? __label__1 I ' m pretty sure I didn ' t violate 3RR unless there ' s another revert I ' m missing. Does replacing the "/" in <tt>&lt ; ref name=missingref /></tt> when replacing a deleted reference count as a revert ? __label__1 Then can you suggest me something, how should i do it. Because if i sort the array, i loose track of indexes, and i need to know which index the value came from??__label__1 Can you post the benchmark code to see how you are measuring this? Are you using -d : DProf ? __label__1 Thanks. BTW, there aren ' t any others that I ' ve missed, are there ? __label__1 No, I don ' t know of any way to measure the number of visitors to articles. Perhaps someone on the <url> can answer your question ? __label__1 Sorry. How much reputation is needed to add a picture ? __label__1 I ' ve filed a <url> in regard to all the recent IPs with which RFD and I have been involved. Could you look there and offer an opinion ? __label__1 I aggree.. river name then "River". Do you think that since it ' s a list of rivers in China we should use the Chinese name and the international norm name too ? __label__1 I would like to hear how this can be done with python. Can windows be resized and repositioned by command line ? __label__1 You could serialize Python objects to files and then load them. The problem is that model is too large ? __label__1 What have you tried? What are the difficulties you encounter ? __label__1 I have extended the block to 1 week. Has s / he been attempting to change your password too ? __label__1 sorry what do you mean by processing power ? __label__1 Well, actually I wanted to know if there were any errors in my own maps. ;) Anyway, is the new map at <url> better ? __label__1 What sort of non - Oracle database ? Is it running on the same machine or over a network ?__label__1 These two factors make me think that Indian ice - cream is a better name for the article than sxusem. What are your thoughts on this ? __label__1 Thanks Anon. Better now ? __label__1 I would recommend asking the question on Programmers . stackexchange . com .. Also, it ' s a huge question. Can you shorten it please ? __label__1 It could be the way you are saving your photo for web - use. Are you using Photoshop ' s "Save for Web" option ? __label__1 And an "intelligent crop" is a 3rd. Note though that the aspect ratios are different in the example (0 . 96 vs 1 . 1) so perhaps Andre means resizing first, then cropping to match aspect ratio ? __label__1 You ' re obviously an experienced editor. Am I correct that this is not your first (or only) user name ? __label__1 This doesn ' t fix your problem, but why are you mixing C++ and C - style strings? For a start, you ' ve engineered yourself a memory leak (where does the memory pointed to `buf` go?).__label__1 The way you were doing it at first looks right. Can you post the exact text of the error message you get ? __label__1 How are `g _ rx _ buffer` and `BYTE` defined? What compiler are you using ? __label__1 You had deleted the mozzarepa article I was working on since it was judged as an advert (something I didn ' t intend.) How can I edit and change the article so it is acceptable ? __label__1 Looks good! Did you check out <url>?__label__1 Yes, sorry I didn ' t see the discussion. How about moving it to a subpage of <url>, say <url>?__label__1 Your wording of the directory structure is a little confusing. Would you please update your question with a more specific directory structure and which HTTP error codes are returning for which files in that structure ? __label__1 Wonderful! :) Do you particularly like to work on comics creators' articles ? __label__1 I think a bot could come along later and remove those double returns. Is there a way of coding a space into the template itself ? __label__1 Is it always the same for every file, or does it vary between files? Also, is it always the same number of question marks ? __label__1 Hi ER, which Bio. do you think could use a little of my majic (smile)?__label__1 This doesn ' t really make any sense. Are the word documents going to be downloaded from links on the site or do they just contain text FOR the site ? __label__1 Does your project involve some graphical user interface? What do you want to code ? __label__1 Good point. What about in non - sushi applications? Should I always rinse rice? or, is it OK not to rinse when I ' m not making sushi ? __label__1 If you open a terminal in Gnome and do `sudo cat /dev / vcs1` it should show what should be displayed on tty1 (same for vcs2 - 6). Do you see a login prompt or any console messages ? __label__1 Youssef, have you had a chance to try one of the suggested approaches / tools for text categorization? If so, how did it work out for you ? __label__1 Could you elaborate on what is happening? Is the method being called at all ? __label__1 Usually compilers should generate a good code for such algorithms. Did you check what assembly a C compiler is generating ? __label__1 I think I updated the pharmacology project banner to put C - class articles into the appropriate category (previously, it was putting them into the unassessed class. If you want to double - check, that would be great; I think it may take a little while for it to update the articles ? __label__1 Can you respond to the comments I left on the S & M PR page please. If you are satisfied with the changes, can you tell me if it is qualifiable for FAN and if not for FAN, then for A class status ? __label__1 There is no line that begins with "X - From_:" in the "show original" message. Any other suggestions ? __label__1 Do you disagree with this reasoning?. If so, could you explain why ? __label__1 Are you a professional illustrator, or an aspiring one? Where might I have seen your work ? __label__1 Is it acceptable to build an auxiliary data structure to guide the decision process? Could that data structure have size O ( n) of the original list ? __label__1 Oh no! Is this related to the double roasted peppers from the salsa thread ? __label__1 I am reluctant to mention this, but having your paragraph in bold on <url> seems to me to be a bit self - promotional and unfair to the other members. Is there any chance that I might be able to persuade you to voluntarily unbold it ? __label__1 I am willing to try to discover the problem. What browser do you use ? __label__1 My question is "Why?" I am doing all the citations correctly and this still appears often. Can anyone tell me what I ' m doing wrong ? __label__1 Following your edit, it looks like your rescue is catching a SystemExit exception (raised when you call exit) rather than the TypeError from trying to join nil with a String. What ' s on multi . rb line 234 ? __label__1 I used <url> as precedence. Thoughts ? __label__1 @Alan Good. Can someone verify for Debian (repositories don ' t have 5 . 12 . x), Mac OS X (MacPorts has 5 . 12 . 2), and Windows (ActiveState Perl 5 . 12 . 3)?__label__1 That ' s a pretty simple way. Does it work ? __label__1 Agreed with @Kyle. Did you try increasing the width of the container housing the #featurebox - secondary just to verify if the widths are not out of place ? __label__1 On your Citation templates subpage you have the statement "CS1 and CS2 both use <person> as a meta - template and are variants of APA style." In the past I have had experienced editors tell me this, but none of them could point to any documentation or contemporaneous discussion to verify this statement. Can you point me to any confirmation of this statement ? __label__1 hahah, thanks! Must admit, when I saw the title of this section I was thinking "oh lord, another what - is - the - wiki - coming - to comment.." :p. How goes ? __label__1 We still need more details: do you have your own SMTP server? Or are you using a gmail account for instance to send your mail through ? __label__1 I restored 3 non - piped blue links. How does that look ? __label__1 I can ' t find a page by that name that has ever existed. Can you please specify the exact name (capitalization is important), or link to the deletion log or discussion ? __label__1 We probably need to see your code or at least get some more information on what is not working. If you are trying to overlay onto google maps, is your wfs layer in spherical mercator projection ? __label__1 Perhaps you can help me. How do I view the status of a vandalism report I ' ve made ? __label__1 Where would you like the review? On the article talk page ? __label__1 Could `curl` help with this? Any idea how ? __label__1 I notice that spell checkers complain if you don ' t capitalize Internet. Didn ' t yours ? __label__1 Are you limited to a particular subset of SQL? Are you just referring to ANSI sql, or vendor specific extensions (Oracle, SQL Server, etc)?__label__1 There is a special tool which shows you page sizes? Would you like to know how to use it ? __label__1 @den: OK, so the rectangles are represented as two points. Is this a vector representation or a raster ?__label__1 Well, the problem you linked to is entirely different than what you ' re describing. Can you please decide on which one you need help with ? __label__1 I could have a go. When would you need it ? __label__1 It would be helpful to learn what types of helper functions you ' ve written. Do they lend themselves well to a Term::Menus approach ? __label__1 I moved the numbered Gurkha regiments to u201cGu201d so theyu2019re all together; what do you think about doing the same for the other names with numbers in? (East Anglians for example)?__label__1 Hah, yea I know, there isn ' t a good option. The aversion is fallout from all those 'Can somebody suggest a good walk around lens?'__label__1 Just to clarify - your want to output the strings from the short text file, subtracting any strings from the short text file that are in the long text file? Also, how large are each of these files, and what code have you written thus far ? __label__1 Interesting question. Even if you didn ' t end up with a powder as a result- how can you make a stock or consume so pure that it doesn ' t taste like meat anymore ? __label__1 Although I agree more or less with your recent edits on the article, I don ' t think that when the example of the Texas Statutes is given, changing the language of the precise statute is appropriate. Perhaps finding another example from another state would change the language appropriately without removing the quoted citation ? __label__1 I do understand the bot was approved and is doing useful job, but. Is it possible to modify it to not save the changes if it is only one - two whitespace ( s)?__label__1 It seems like you ' re trying to parse html. Have you looked at nokogiri ? __label__1 I ' m kind of afraid to undo <url>, mainly because I have doubt in whether the nihongo template is necessary at all. Thoughts ? __label__1 sorry about that. Can it be done in python ? __label__1 I updated original question with persistentStoreCoordinator method which I got from my AppDelegate . m. Regarding the two different managed objects, I guess I messed this up, am I only supposed to have one in the app delegate ? __label__1 Thanks. Oh, and if you don ' t mind, would you please block the sockmaster ? __label__1 This happens for me, too, but only on my dev machine. Did you ever find an explanation ? __label__1 I ' m in Outer Mongolia from the 27th till the 10th, UB, Hovsgol, UB. Maybe we can meet ? __label__1 @D . W. if thats the case, as I thought, it ' s not really a security question, is it ? __label__1 Hmm.. I ' m new here at Wikipedia and your explanation is a little cloudy..Should I delink the references website ? __label__1 WDM, the Homeopathy article is starting to stabilize. But just a thought, will an FAC cause it blow up again ? __label__1 This came up for discussion on <url>. What is the last word on it ? __label__1 @noldorin - then the physicists in question really should start reading up on it or be prepared to get left behind ! What standards are we expecting from physicists - that they strive to be the very best in what they do or that they be satisfied with mediocrity ? __label__1 @kostya - LOL. I guess we don ' t want this site to turn into national - enquirer . se, right ? :)__label__1 I think if you were to consider the DAL as a seperate entity and imagine that it was your sole responsibility whilst all consumers was work done by a third party, you would probably raise an exception for Access Denied - most of the framework would. If however, you want to avoid _exception logic_ it would be helpful to provide functions to help the consumers determine if they have sufficient access to data - though that sounds like more of a business logic issue, which is it that controls the access ? __label__1 Thank you for your time, but, perhaps; If I give you the iformation and images and such for Lord Strachan, could you maybe make it? It shouldn ' t be that hard to find info, or images, but I already have them, so if I give you this stuff, perhaps could you do it ? __label__1 I was visiting the <url> article again today, and I had the same instinctive reaction to the image, that it is too specific and not representative of all pederastic relationships but only the sexual ones. Would you mind if I changed to something more representative of the practice, like a symposium image ? __label__1 I ' ve tried reading about them but most of the websites I ' ve stumbled on don ' t really explain how one should actually use these. Do I just need a class which wraps my record header / data and then overloads << and >> to use these ? __label__1 Pizza powder? What ' s that ? __label__1 just to verify, can you capture what the generated SQL looks like for a simple get like `Session . get ( SecurityContact . class, id)`, hql with `from SecurityContact where securityId = ?` and your left join attempt? Also, what version of Hibernate are you using ? __label__1 I removed that second paragraph entirely, since the information is covered in the article. Do you feel that the lead should be larger ? __label__1 That looks OK to me (just learning Haskell myself, though). Is there anything specifically wrong ? __label__1 Are you running the latest version of PhoneGap - i . e. clone from the github repository ? __label__1 Hey Alex.. I just emailed a United Kingdom professor, intending to email a University of Kentucky professor. If he expresses interest, are you the person he should talk to ? __label__1 It already look great. BTW, what are your thoughts about the previous post on the names of the other post office and rates lists ? __label__1 Your reasoning is very sound, it would appear that USGS is wrong and I have no problem with changing it back. In general, what are your thoughts on using the GNIS database for park coordinates / elevations as we convert to the Geobox ? __label__1 Thanks for the ce ' s on Attachment therapy. Are you kindly undertaking the second opinion ? __label__1 Thats ok, as long as you verify the copyright as by sending an e - mail, or noting the license on the AEK webpage. That wont be a problem, will it ? __label__1 What about installing "TTS Service Extended"? Does that do anything for you ? __label__1 So far, I haven ' t seen any sound samples in music articles, not even in <url>, which is featured according to the nomninator of <url>. Can you point me to a page where I can find this discussed ? __label__1 I think I know what is the problem. How can I add 1 sec (or more) of empty audio between this two files ? __label__1 Please, give some more information. What have you tried, and what error / behavior did it give ? __label__1 After running a translation on the first source, I can find any link there either referring to Studio Junio. Care to elaborate ? __label__1 Hey, I think that perhaps Raleigh Park should redirct to <url> rather the the Nottingham halls of residece article. Do you agree ? __label__1 It might be good to give some more context: What kind of computer? What operating system (version)?__label__1 What are you optimizing for? For example, read throughput (concurrent reads from multiple machines), fault tolerance in the face of machines becoming not available, low number of machines.. Do you also need writes ? __label__1 You might be just the person I need- <url> has just been repeatedly vandalised and with ? German - in there - wonder what you would do with the vandal ? __label__1 Erica, I understand you are a figure skating enthusiast. Are you still active in those types of articles ? __label__1 With highlighting, you mean selecting it or do you want to wrap it in e . g. a `span` tag ? __label__1 Thanks very much indeed! :-) I don ' t suppose you ' d fancy having a deadlink trawl over at <url>, would you ? __label__1 Are you trying to create some type of tile system, or are you just wanting to draw different parts of the image at a time. What are you using it for ? __label__1 Hi, Google found your start at a Bayt Nuba article. Do you want help ? __label__1 Please see <url>. Could you help with the list on the talk page ? __label__1 Since you ' re also allowing nodes to be visited more than once, then there are an infinite amount of paths: `4 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 5`, (you can keep repeating `2 - 1 - 2 - 1-..`). Perhaps I ' m misinterpreting your question ? __label__1 So is there any problem / issue you are facing? What is the problem ? __label__1 Can you post your Session class? Does the constructor use invalid arguments ? __label__1 large as in 10^6 or large as in 10^12 ? Are there any bounds on the end points of the range which includes all the intervals ?__label__1 How are you closing the connection on the server? `close` or `shutdown`?__label__1 I don ' t really know the answer to this, but have you considered lowering the quality or decreasing the size of the image yourself? Maybe take the UIImage from the camera delegate event, scale it down and then save using UIImageJPEGRepresentation with a lower quality setting ? __label__1 This user, whom you recently blocked, has persisted in using both his user and user talk pages for repeat personal attacks. Would it be wise to protect these pages ? __label__1 hm, can one award a bounty to a "question"? as in "reward the author for this awesome script"?__label__1 Sorry nevermind I found the option for it :) Without having much knowledge of Wordpress, do you know how I ' d go about combining image map within the fancybox with some custom jQuery to trigger events based on the area clicks ? __label__1 Since this person made a sincere attempt to discuss the page, and the page in his opinion was relevent, you can remove this warning from his talk page? In the spirit of <url>, perhaps ? __label__1 interesting, i have used my google apps as the email to chat for some time and never had any problem connecting to other users. Could you describe the issue you are seeing ? __label__1 Let ' s hope for the best. Did you get a chance to look at any server access logs from just after the last IISReset to the first incidence of the error ? __label__1 You are passing a URL string into a method that takes a file path. Did you try initWithContentsOfURL and passing an NSURL instead ? __label__1 @agent - j - i ' m not seeing an error - the problem is that the Regex keeps returning the errorMessage for the above string and it doesn ' t make sense ? i . e. wanted someone to confirm it ' s not incorrect ?__label__1 Instead of deletion, I ' m considering simply redirecting Ponystars to <url>. Any objections ? __label__1 Sounds good to me. Shall we have a straw poll on it ? __label__1 That ' s OK &mdash; I just wondered if you had a new translation that used "on". Where are you studying philosophy, by the way ? __label__1 I ' m working on improving the references on Kulwicki ' s article to get more reliable ones. I ' ve also worked on improving <url>'s article toward GA. Do you know much about drag racing ? __label__1 Which part of the task are you having trouble with? What hints have your lecture notes or textbook given you about this problem ? __label__1 Are any of these answers useful enough for you to consider accepting one? If not, what else would you need in an answer ? __label__1 @Nick for some reason, your automator is trying to open /Library / InputManagers / MultiClutchInputManager . bundle which is very suspicious. Could you create a new user, log into that account and perform the same test ? __label__1 @Mike: I would stick to what I have if this is better than what I am seeking. My thinking is if there was already an calculated number assigned, I can use it because $(".chk : even") and $(".chk : odd") would be iterating through all rows twice correct ? __label__1 Hi Khoikhoi - I see you deleted a previous incarnation of a pan - Arabism article which seems to be resurfacing under variant names, and is now at <url>. This doesn ' t read to me like an encyclopedia article - do you have any thoughts on whether / under what criterion it should be deleted ? __label__1 Your code is missing the `find _ current _ round` subroutine. Could you post it as well ? __label__1 Good point - I was unaware of that. Perhaps then you should include a short reference to Aquitanian in the sentence ? __label__1 The profile seems good as it is. Why don ' t we bring this back up after the Hibiki 2 - parter ? __label__1 I ' m curious what your reasoning is in saying <url>'s edits are in "good faith" and not blocking him when the two edits right before that were both vandalism of user pages. It seemed quite a slam dunk to me, did you happen to see something I missed ? __label__1 I use 11 . 04 and I still get the popup. Could you include a screenshot, please ? __label__1 Great idea on the mixed meat. I ' ll give a 50 / 50 a try. BTW, isn ' t much sausage cured ground beef ? __label__1 Are there any other limitations on a _ i? for example a _ i >=0 ? __label__1 Everything about <url> looks fantastic, but.. going to |2 instead of |30em seems like a major step back. Is there a reason for it ? __label__1 @Sklivvz: We could exclude time travel by considering two copies of the Universe and asking if two identical atoms would decay simultaneously. Would you agree that this is an equivalent problem ? __label__1 I think I need some more sleep - did anyone else read this as "Please take this question seriously. I have some monkeys and ideas.." ?__label__1 Can it be expanded beyond a definition? Can you write something about who coined it, references to its usage in popular culture, things of those sorts ? __label__1 absolutely correct!! UMM what is in the blue J - box on back side of the wall?? possible junction location for an extension wire??__label__1 http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / User : Mheart did the copyedit for the Japanese flag article and it was completed today. Is there anything else other than a copyedit that you need for this article ? __label__1 I have indicated on <url> that, should you be desyopped, I will immediately re - nominate you for sysop. Would you accept the nomination if I did ? __label__1 Can we pass a law that cars may not be operated within 100 yards of children under the age of 6? Which law would have a greater impact on public health ? __label__1 Chances are, this doesn ' t exist. Also, language ? __label__1 It ' s not clear what you mean by 'Printing ( saving)'. Where do you want the command saved to ? __label__1 Good! By the way, what do you think of merging the recurring animals in <url> to <url> and then getting rid of the rest ? __label__1 There are already plenty of reasonably commonplace words presented in answers, but (slipping into 'armchair philologist' mode) I can ' t help wondering if the process of 'word - sharing' between languages is skewed more towards *importing* rather than *exporting* in the case of Far Eastern languages. Might the supposedly more self - effacing character of such speakers make them quicker to adopt the foriegner ' s words rather than keep pushing their own ? __label__1 What have you tried so far? Do you have any pseudo - code that you ' ve come up with on your own that others can comment on ? __label__1 Hi, thanks for letting me know about my signature not being linked. I tried to save the settings in preferences - did it work ? __label__1 @ Joe. Since this is community Wiki, mind if I clean up the intro to get to the details a bit more succinctly ? __label__1 GorillaWarfare- I don ' t know if you saw my reply on my talk page. Are you interested in being my mentor for the GU De - Ba ' athification article ? __label__1 When you say "no other access to the dictionary of words", do you mean that you don ' t have access to the actual dictionary that `IsValidWord` is using, or that you cannot use a dictionary at all? Would using a separate dictionary be OK, in the hopes that it matches the one that `IsValidWord` is using ? __label__1 I ' ve been talking to Bill Oakley on Twitter and he ' s going to direct message me a few minor changes to his article. Do you have any suggestions for how that could be acceptable as a source ? __label__1 Hey MBK; well, I ' ve got to be honest I wasn ' t expecting the events of last night - personally I thought the discussion was going reasonably well (not fabulously, but we were getting somewhere) and, whilst I agree that Mlm ' s actions weren ' t exactly advised, I must admit it does seem to be a relatively minor thing to retire over - was there something else going on here that made it the straw that broke his back? Anyhow, I agree with you that he ' ll be greatly missed - I sent him a message on NSF but I doubt if I ' ll get any reply - what are your thoughts on the matter ? __label__1 Indeed. I trust you have already watchlisted this editor ? __label__1 I could not figure out how to make this view. Can you elaborate on this please, or refer me to a suitable link ? __label__1 This is most likely a problem due to the encoding of your input. In what encoding is it in ? __label__1 Hi. Just out of interest, are you by any chance the same Tom Walker who maintains this <url>?__label__1 I am planning on changing the <url> to the ICF Flatwater World Championships. Any objections ? __label__1 Hey, I just went ahead and reverted <url>. I was wondering if you wanted your userpage semi - protected to prevent that happening in the future ? __label__1 How are you using the FtWebRequest class? Do you have to problem with all FTP servers or just the one ? __label__1 Thanks terribly for looking it up. Would it be alright for me to use the new source in Europe, economy section then ? __label__1 I just tried using your code verbatim and it ' s working correctly for me (label is correctly centered in view). Perhaps something else is interfering with it ? __label__1 What ' s a `kill -9`?

When does the drive end: at the start of August 13 or at the end, and according to which timezone ? __label__1 More important than how they work is how to shut them down.

Via the official Facebook app or something else ? __label__1 What is a string pointer?

Or would it be merely annoying ? __label__1 I ' m still seeing the "clear" link on my profile page. Is this a change that they ' re still rolling out ? __label__1 Thanks, I will try this. How much can the temperature fluctuate? How close to 20C does it need to be ? __label__1 Just an FYI, I replied at FPOC. How many lists would you prefer ? __label__1 Excellent question. Can we get som esources as to where the different styles originated ? __label__1 Your question currently doesn ' t make any sense as it is worded. Could you please edit it and clarify what you are asking ? __label__1 Some time ago you uploaded an image of the Knowledge Navigator, which was speedied some time later. Can you upload the file again ? __label__1 We don ' t have master switches for stoves in the US. Could you explain how this works ? __label__1 Yes, I received the warning about asking a subjective Q but I got no responses on other Q & A sites like Yahoo so I thought I ' d give it a shot. What ' s a CW ? __label__1 The only 2gb executables I know about contain archives themselves. Could you extract or partially extract the executable before packaging it ? __label__1 I ' ve tried expanding it a bit, and removed a (somewhat inaccurate) sentence that referred to the chemical structure of anthracyclines. Any better ? __label__1 I tried to use logcat, but there ' s so much data provided I don ' t know how to sort through it. would you like all of the data ? __label__1 Congratulations, OGoncho! Isn ' t there a barnstar for things like that ? __label__1 I ' ve tried to understand your question, but it is hard. Can you improve the formatting so that we can see what you are asking ? __label__1 And NFS and DNS and other stuff too. Can you provide a breakdown by port ? __label__1 That ' s great. What ' s your question ? __label__1 I think this question it ' s more related to robotics than to coding. Have you tried to search into that category ? __label__1 When you say line do you mean character? For the given input what is your desired output ? __label__1 On another subject, have you finished the books I suggested? Want more ? __label__1 I hate to roll back 26 edits in a row, but I see a lot of good stuff, a lot of questionable and non - NPOV stuff, not much (if anything) in the way of citation, and a ton of misspellings. Can we discuss these edits before imposing them, please ? __label__1 So there ' s exactly one line in both files per chromosome number, and you want to compare only lines with the same chromosome number? And do the files contain the same keys ? __label__1 Cool. Is this something I can invoke with a template on the page or something ? __label__1 And which part of that are you have trouble with, exactly? Can you post the code in question ? __label__1 Thank You. What is "The Prince of Santorini" anyway ? __label__1 you can do this with a container that is positioned absolute / fixed with a width and height of 100%. background can then be set to `background - position: center center` I think ? __label__1 Hi, I noted that you removed the caption of the image of the estate of Rozhdestveno that indicated that "Nabokov inherited the <url>- designed estate "Rozhestveno" in 1916." The picture had been taken by User : Alexey Lavrov attesting that it was VN ' s house, and VN describes (p72) that he inherited the house in 1916, upon the death of his uncle Ruka. Can you please explain where you see the problem with the caption that you had to remove it ? __label__1 Do they all have the same size and orientation ? Can you pivote them or should they conserve both proportion and orientation ?__label__1 Depends, do you want it to actually respond to commands? Or just gauge yelling ? __label__1 Do you want to check if it looks ok ? Do you want to check if the file exists ?__label__1 OK, I ' ve started the deletion debate at <url>. As a major contributor, would you mind indicating there that you agree with deleting the page ? __label__1 Ah, I see. If you don ' t mind, I ' ve more or less understood everything, but just wish to inquire about 2 things: (1) could you please explain the `$form _ state` variable a bit more; and (2) I ' m guessing that `$job _ node->field _ number [ 0]['value']` writes that value to the first webform field ? __label__1 The <url> disambiguation page seems to be a model for collecting the related entries for IOOF buildings in a single place. Do you agree ? __label__1 Can you provide more details? Did your application launch at all before you received this dialog ? __label__1 The section starting with ''a philosophical defeat, etc'' is somewhat informal in style. Could you try to eliminate solecisms when you get a chance ? __label__1 I know there is some discussion at <url> regarding primary topics so I ' m unsure if performing this edit would be an ok move. Thoughts ? __label__1 Ok, then your own code seems cleanest. And although this is offtopic: how did you generate those images? :)__label__1 The easiest language to do a task in is often the one you know the best! Which languages / tools do you already know ? __label__1 My end goal is to get a list of rows with unique data (as determined by a combination of 3 cells in a row); however, I need all the cells of the unique rows. Maybe an array of hashes would be better suited for this task ? __label__1 Ok, I will create. You will help to expand it ? __label__1 Done. Do you specifically want small numbers inside the big number, or just shading ? __label__1 I saw your comment on Jimbo ' s talk page about plagiarism and copyleft. Would you have time to have a look at <url> and <url> (where most of the discussion has taken place)?__label__1 If I have a simple graph (tree) with 4 nodes: a start node with 3 successors, where rightmost successor is an end node, then all three algorithms (DFS, BFS, ID) will perform better backward than forward. Correct ? __label__1 Thanks! =D And how soon are we going to try to get The Lost Age to FA ? __label__1 That ' s..pretty cool, actually. Would love to see this with a harder tire, though. Do you have manufacturer ' s ordering information ? __label__1 Hi, what are the technical steps to withdraw a nomination to delete a category? Or more specifically, what template did you use to withdraw your nomination ? __label__1 @user391 - I really don ' t like doing this but I ' m going to recommend we close this because it is really not about WordPress but about those other solutions and by definition will be off - topic, see http://area51 . stackexchange . com / proposals / 1500 ? phase=definition As a moderator I can close but I want 1 or 2 other opinions before I do. Others agree or disagree ? __label__1 What an interesting idea. I ' ll ponder it more. Have you ever seen this done for real ? __label__1 I ' m trying to install Lupin / Anti - vandal tool, but im stuck. Could you help please ? __label__1 I think it is a great idea to merge my Geraldine Jones article to the flip Wilson show article, but I don ' t know how to do that. Can you help me ? __label__1 Nope, it ' s not in violation of anything, but it would certainly be useful for other images, I ' m sure. Also, I may have a few uses for it; would you mind sharing it under a public domain license or a Creative Commons license ? __label__1 What have you tried? Have you read the documentation ? __label__1 You have change the intent of the question considerably. Can you post a new code example to show the problem ? __label__1 Can I use a manga image colored by myself? There won ' t be any problems with the lisense, right ? __label__1 Is it for a particular CPU (e . g. a Z80 or the Cell processor ' s SPU) or for some abstract CPU ? __label__1 Very nice. How could I doubt you ? __label__1 This looks right, and works for me. What do you see ? __label__1 You should also consider the ergonomics of your setup. For instance, does one configuration or the other cause you to move your next out of it ' s natural position more than the other ? __label__1 Can you take a look at the article <url> and the conversation going on at <url> (that should probably be moved to the article talk page). Your thoughts on the most recent commentary ? __label__1 It reminds me of [APL](http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / APL_%28programming _ language % 29). Tell me how comfortable you would be using that as a programming language ? __label__1 I ' ve replied to most of the concerns. Could you please look over them ? __label__1 I ' m unfamiliar with the principles behind mixing paint. Can you briefly explain how this works so people like me may better answer the spirit of your question ? __label__1 As does ''<url>'', and ''<url>'', and even ''<url>''. Wanna be friends ? __label__1 Just to clarify, the circle comes in to the definition of what it means to be adjacent -- element n is adjacent to element 1 -- but you do not consider rotations of the same bit pattern to be the same. Is that right ? __label__1 Hi, I ' m looking for a clerk that would be willing to act as my trainer. Would you be available to do so ? __label__1 It looks pretty good to me. Can you give some idea of why you think it ' s incorrect ? __label__1 And after seeing this talk page, I ' ll also note that there is no difference between scalars in math, physics and computing, those articles should all be merged together. :-/ Maybe you ' d be interested in doing such a merge ? __label__1 ''Wiki - star'': Hm? Is there a reason for your sorrow my good man ? __label__1 @Unreason About the rectangular case - think of the situation when points aren ' t positioned in a rectilinear way (basically, the points inside the rectangle can take any position and, hence, build complex curves). If I have some matrix with these points, what should I do to make my mesh resolution larger (in terms of points per square inch, for example)?__label__1 It sounds like you ' re trying to dump LiveCD images for various distributions onto a USB drive and then be able to boot them. Is this correct ? __label__1 ahh please this is so common its not even funny. Why do managers think that testing can be optional just cause their getting fire from above ? __label__1 I have found a better citation for reference 7, but am not sure how to insert the page number (p. 97 from the book cited). Do you know the right format for this ? __label__1 I have looked back in my archives a year, and cannot find the issue concerned - although I certainly remember the name, your account, and the style. Can you give me the relevant link / diff, so I can refresh my memory and be best informed what action might be appropriate ? __label__1 Go to <url> and create it like you would a page: just add a little text by putting in a little explanation at the top and adding categories u2014 see <url> for a basic category of this sort, although on a very different subject. Let me ask, however: are you planning to categorise articles about schools and / or districts, or articles on the cities where they are based ? __label__1 Please describe the problem itself. What can be the obstacles to assigning a free guest to a free motorcycle ? __label__1 Can you please describe in more detail what you mean with "inclined"? Should the line go from the upper corner of a cell to the bottom opposite corner of the same cell, or should it cross several cells ? __label__1 Looks like a type in the second `RewriteCond`. Should you have a space before the `\.html`?__label__1 I would be willing to move this article to the incubator so that it can be worked on (I agree it wouldn ' t be an A7 today), though if it ' s to be made into a real article it needs to be done with someone with no conflict of interest regarding the subject, as creating articles for things you own is highly discouraged. If I undelete it to the incubator would you agree to let it go and leave it up to other users without a conflict of interest ? __label__1 I ' m not clear about this, if you ' re asking for a cryptographically secure random number generator - even with certain additional constraints - then that ' s easy, just tell us which platform / language you ' re on. If you ' re asking for something else - then it ' s not clear, and why would you ask on ITsec ? __label__1 I noticed your edits and the VfD discussion on the topic. Are you on facebook ? __label__1 Hi Cmadler, I ' ve written a new ALT hook at the <person> that I think addresses your concerns. Could you sign off on the nomination ? __label__1 So, what do you think of it? Interesting guy, isn ' t he ? __label__1 BFS is a pretty basic graph - searching algorithm - seems like it would take a ginormous graph to make it infeasible.. How big is a normal graph (both edges and vertices)? Also, how is it stored ? __label__1 <url> is having <url> spelling "<url>". Perhaps you could help ? __label__1 xD if you say so! By the way, what ' s your favorite game ever ? __label__1 My post above was a helpful hint about following DYK as a whole, not about the nomination process. Would you mind posting your post under a new heading, as it seems to have little to do with what I was saying and seems to be changing the subject ? __label__1 Where is this dead zone? Can you please update your question with a screenshot ? __label__1 That code works for me. Does it work for you if you just use that in an otherwise empty document ? __label__1 @John, if so, bugger! I am still ranked well, I wonder if or when I will drop ? __label__1 @Ivo Wetzel So, you are saying there is not way to get all objects attributes and values ? Or to convert such object to an associative array ?__label__1 @Zimbabao Cached MySQL is our front - runner at the moment. Has that worked well for you ? __label__1 @Jack Leow: I tried both running the server in debug mode & inspecting "content" and displaying it on the console with System . out . println(). @John Wagenleitner: Any idea as to what could be wrong on my side ? __label__1 How do you sync the flash? Do you mean that you just press the shutter button and then try to manually activate the flash in time to light the picture ? __label__1 Does saying `/bin / sh -l` fix it? If not, what about switching to another shell, like `tcsh -l`?__label__1 I tried updating it to WP : DAB style but I got reverted. Can you use your magic there and explain to the user why we should follow MOS : DP and such ? __label__1 @Dave: I ' m also voting to close as a duplicate, and it is indeed annoying that, as a newcomer, you can ' t vote on questions yet - but this is done to prevent gaming the system. I solved the original question - but [it seems you did too](http://wordpress . stackexchange . com / questions / 4782 / overwriting - core - wordpress - functions - with - plugins)?__label__1 Aha, problem solved, while I was writing that, you set up a new article! Should we change <url> into a disambiguation page ? __label__1 How would you represent your distribution? - alternatively - are you looking for a specific solution for gaussian distribution ? __label__1 Some prof once told me that 1N400x ' s are all made the same, just graded differently based on how they turn out. Not sure how much I believe that, but if you look at [some datasheets](http://ww . diodes . com / datasheets / ds28002 . pdf) all specified parameters are the same except Vr and only two different capacitances (maybe they just make 1N4004 and 7 ' s?)__label__1 Hi -i am editing the Juan Martin article with guitar technique information , and user addhoc is deleting all my writing. Please , what do i do about this ? __label__1 So the new account is for you to use? Or for the other person ? __label__1 yes you are right I guess the problem is really whats happening around release, (I just wanted to ask if this is fine to do). Actually it ' s related to cocos2d before release I am making a CCAction and I have a CCSprite *sp, I am simply doing [sp runAction : anim]; while the animation is running I am releasing it, though nothing happens to the animation visually but is it right ? __label__1 Please could show the variant with alignat* too? (align both relation symbols and equation numbers)?__label__1 @Mac: I ' d be interested in hearing more about that situation. Can you post it as a question, for us to solve the incompatibility ? __label__1 Sorry, I can ' t see it. Would you mind cutting and pasting the sentence that says she won an award ? __label__1 Moved. would you like me to nominate you for adminship ? __label__1 if you mean _window . onload = onload_, then that would work, or something similar. have you tried your example to see what happens ? __label__1 You ' re welcome. What else is peer review for ? __label__1 Further, one may ask why there is no proto - tumour - suppressor. Could it be because tumour - suppressors were discovered later, when mechanisms were better understood ? __label__1 I guess you know how a template looks, for everything..something like from the small thumbnails to the big backgrounds as you said. I will give you some ideas..tech, management, industry, computers, food, can you picture what i`m trying to say ?__label__1 Oh, and since this is a story - telling kind of topic, shouldn ' t this be CW? (Does it need 30 answers first, and can users with rep<100 still answer then?)__label__1 Given the screenshot, is it possible you have JavaScript that ' s interfering with the display of the form element ' s value? Or, well, CSS that renders the text invisible ? __label__1 @kraceKumar: i have another prob..the file writing here that is done row - wise skips a row as it writes into "myfile . csv". how can i make it not skip a line while writing ? __label__1 Please, may I give this 10 upvotes? Please ? __label__1 Sorry for the late reply , I have taken view based template . Actually I need to convert the pdf page to image and in that process it ' s giving me error with the code above. Any solution ? __label__1 I don ' t have the full list online, but I do have the 07 - 08 AJHL record book. Are there any specific seasons or teams you are looking for ? __label__1 @conmulligan thanks for the heads up are there any plans to let people login ? slos I noticed that when i searched a tag and and selected it i got old topics that had new answers first rather than just the newest topics is that intentional ?__label__1 I cannot see a problem with this. Do you get a completely blank cell of a missing image icon ? __label__1 scheme is pretty easy to debug. What step does the stepper stop you at ? __label__1 Which VB do you want an answer for? VB . Net, VB6, VBA, or VBScript ? __label__1 Thanks! hmm, I ' ve done something wrong -- it ' s hiding them, but it ' s not showing the link that says "more info"?__label__1 what happens when you type, for example, `git` on the command line? Or `which git`?__label__1 Cool idea. I ' m curious, though, how can one drill all the way through 80" of door in a straight line ? __label__1 You may break up to three sets trying to form a street (or the other way around). Is that ok ? __label__1 Out of interest (I might check) .. do you know how the Australian Bureau of statitics classes / categories Australian Aborigines/ Aboriginal Australians??__label__1 I don ' t want to sound rude and don ' t mean any offence, but do you have any experience with coding normal physics (i . e. Rigid body physics)?__label__1 How are your PC and PS3 connected to the network (i . e. wirelessly or via ethernet)?__label__1 In the summer (June - July) I am going to work on the ''Messiah'' article. Would you like to be in on this ? __label__1 Good luck on your <url>. What time is <url> <url>?__label__1 It ' s not too long, certainly; but the extended quote does look a bit out of place there. Perhaps it would be possible to move the bulk of the quote into the body of the article and leave a short phrase or two that could be inline with the second paragraph ? __label__1 Not exactly - I did some messing around and implemented a solution using NSMatrix, as per Apple ' s (very old) Core Recipes code sample. Edit: I note that your comment is rather old - did you resolve the issue ? __label__1 Thanks for telling me. Do you just perform the rename, and I then re - create the account to take it for myself ? __label__1 What is your data? How is it stored / represented ? __label__1 What ' s the class that it can ' t find? Are they all custom classes ? __label__1 This is set theory and takes some pretty interesting uses of SQL. What database are you using (Oracle, SQL Server)?__label__1 When you say concatenate, do you mean overlay them (put them in the same place) or put them next to each other? If you mean overlay, what do you want to happen when two pixels are at the same spot -- how do you want transparency to be handled ? __label__1 Problem solved! Aren ' t administrators handy ? __label__1 @Mgccl: Great that you found a better solution for your specific case. May I ask what you are doing this for ? __label__1 I found <url> while working <url> from <url>, my first impulse was to give it a prod, an long unreferenced orphan without a clear reason to exist. I see you are still active on Wikipedia, is there chance you can do something for this article ? __label__1 The Birr page looks good now.. but, it seems a little strange to make a distinction between Abyssinia and Ethiopia, as if they were two different entities. The native name was ''ityoppya'' (Ethiopia) long before 1931; in that year, the Emperor formally requested the international community to begin using Ethiopia instead of Abyssinia, much as the Shah, around the same time, requested the use of "Iran" instead of "Persia" for his country (and it was also around this time that Siam became Thailand, I believe..) Anyway, it might make more sense for one box reading "Abyssinia / Ethiopia" in place of the two separate boxes..?__label__1 Your top picture shows two white plastic tabs with the one on the right looking like it is not engaged and pushed into the frig. Possibly this needs to be pulled forward to allow the compression fitting to sit properly (or maybe it is an indicator of shipment damage??).__label__1 I ' ve added a note to <url> to explain the dating; there ' s another couple of places it should go, but I don ' t want to start putting it in 'til you ' ve seen it. What do you reckon ? __label__1 css text - indent can be used to move text off the screen. Will that work ? __label__1 The answers all assume a different type of output. Can you give an example of how you want the output to look (or does it just need to be readable?)__label__1 What does your data look like? Are the values bound ? __label__1 zc . buildout does something like this, although I wouldn ' t want to try reading its source code. Have you tried asking on the distutils - sig mailing list ? __label__1 Also, you say there is only one common element in the three arrays. Does that mean only one element appears in all three arrays and just two of the three arrays can have other common elements, or can two of three arrays have no other common elements than the one that is common in all three ? __label__1 Is this happening in development only? Is it possible that class reloading is the issue as classes are not cached in development if you are adding methods during execution the class could be reloaded without your newly defined methods ? __label__1 Nice continued work on the expressway articles. Is it possible to have some maps or schematic diagrams showing the location or routes of the expressways ? __label__1 Hi I noticed that you changed the category at <url> from "People from Alabama" to "People from Elmore County, Alabama". Is this appropriate, as Opothleyahola was dead for three years before Elmore county had been organized and had been forcibly removed from the area more than thirty years before ? __label__1 What is your take on <url>? And is there a guideline or policy stated somewhere that covers this ? __label__1 Sounds great. Do you think you could add this over at the dicsussion I ' ve started at <url>?__label__1 There may not be a lot of situations like this, but there will definitely be some. I was wondering if there is any kind of invisible comment that can be added to the article in these situations so that the report doesn ' t include it, or if you have any other thoughts about how it might be possible to handle this situation ? __label__1 Is it a directed, acyclic graph? or are cycles allowed ? __label__1 I ' m sorry, but your example only makes me more confused. Why don ' t you first put the first `r` into the first container, the second `b` into the second container, and the next two `r` into the first container, getting the sum of `0`?__label__1 You are right, I apologize not doing so. A different layout for the template could be interesting (perhaps even with names, or those delivered in person / by text) but I didn ' t quite see the logic in the way you had broken up the dates by 20 year blocks interspaced with 4 year blocks, right ? __label__1 I ' m sorry, but I don ' t see what you ' re talking about. Could you be more specific ? __label__1 Very good! Thanks. So in UK terms rumb and eye of round have the same characteristics and both can be used as an example of a (well known) tough piece of meat requiring more work ? __label__1 Sorry I figured the random characters in the receiving end of the socket gave it away. Why is the system receiving 94 / 64 / and 7 ' s (ascii decimal converted from ascii characters) and how can i fix it ? __label__1 Your algorithm would presumably conclude that `{x , y , y , y , y}` and `{x , x , x , x , y}` are equal. Is that the desired behaviour ? __label__1 I don ' t understand this question. Which dictionary, exactly, doesn ' t define "ain ' t"?__label__1 Hi, I meant to do this a long time ago, but I guess I forgot. You are the "Sandpiper" on the HP wiki right ? __label__1 Are you sure you are getting the error on that line? What line are you trying to access the array on ? __label__1 Would it be possible for you to expand / clarify your question? Perhaps word it differently ? __label__1 E - mail me at <url> (just get rid of the spaces in between the letters and numbers) whenever you feel like it. By the way are you a member on any Iranian football forums online ? __label__1 If the period register is 0, it probably never matches and so it never triggers the interrupt. With PR2 line uncommented, can you trigger on a breakpoint set inside the interrupt routine ? __label__1 Could you please give an example of the action names . Will the actions triggered be "future _ to _ published" and "publish _ post"?__label__1 @Sklivvz I ' d recommend to edit the headline. As it is, and taken wordly, the only answer is: "Of course, what else?"__label__1 I am having a hard time figuring out what each symbol means. Could you explicitly identify them, please ? __label__1 This should also be tagged "regex", but only five tags are allowed. This question seems only peripherally related to the Python language, so perhaps that tag should be replaced ? __label__1 Lunch sounds great, Rocket. Do you have an e - mail address I can use to get in touch with you ? __label__1 Have made some comments on your list, looks pretty good overall, my points are just picky ones! Any chance you could return the favour and have a look over <url> for me ? __label__1 I ' m also a bit lost. Do you mean the concept of `\institute` as a macro, or simply where to include it in the title data to get it to print ? __label__1 |style="vertical - align: middle; padding: 3px;" | I ' ve started the Badfinger wiki amd I need help. You seem to know a lot about them, could you please help out ? __label__1 I am really disappointed that common speech allows the use of `who` like that, and I think I am correct when I say that if the cashier had said "Can I help whomever is next?" you will hear snickering in line and a subtle "Why is she speaking like that?".__label__1 Your title is a little ambiguous. Are you asking "how well does it work" or "how does it work"?__label__1 Can you post your code? Also, have you tried using " Timeout::timeout ( 5)" to try and handle timeouts ? __label__1 What do you mean with thickness? Moduli ? __label__1 I think it ' s a great idea to get the CO3 community involved with keeping <url> correct and uptodate. I shan ' t be there myself this year (clashes with various things) - would you be able to bring it up ? __label__1 Oh I can explain how for you. Do you have a <url> computer ? __label__1 Hi, you have tagged the article <url> orphan. Can you please check it ?__label__1 @Zelimir: As answer provided by you, MODE . CLEAR not working with xfermode. Can you please let me know why is it so ? __label__1 Alternatively, maybe the second column could be ''Country of origin'' and Rosen could simply be denoted USA / Poland, while Pillsbury would be USA / USA, without his US State being mentioned - it would be less confusing I think. Any thoughts ? __label__1 I am pretty sure I could, I looked at couple sites that are doing it. I just can ' t see the code cuz its PHP =P Must be some syntax or app setup on the facebook side perhaps ? __label__1 Now, I am looking at the source for `whine . pl` and it seems to be getting these from an SQL database. Isn ' t it better to use the appropriate `SELECT` query to get already sorted bugs out of the database ? __label__1 That is a weird site. For one they count forum software as "Content Management" but then neglect Wordpress ? __label__1 can you be a little more specific and perhaps give some examples of the current vs. desired interface ? __label__1 Hello, thank you for adding interesting content to <url> <url>. Are you able to provide <url> that will help the content meet our "<url>" standard ? __label__1 What server OS (Windows / Linux / Mac) are you running? If it is Linux, then is there a reason a cron job would not work ? __label__1 The code you ' ve posted works fine for me. Are you doing something like `get _ simps ( get _ simps ( 20))`?__label__1 LordAmeth-- once again, many thanks for nominating me. I have a question, though-- I noticed that the process was "scheduled to end" at 16 : 52 today, and we ' re past that now..what happens next ? __label__1 Yellowmonkey has told me we need another FAR delegate and recommended you for the job. Is that something you ' re willing to do ? __label__1 How exactly have you set its height? Have you implemented heightForRowAtIndexPath ? __label__1 Incidentally, your username seems familiar. Do you contribute to SPGB - related forums by any chance ? __label__1 For those of us who aren ' t specifically familiar with `sendmail`, it might help if you post a more complete set of log lines, and describe exactly what details you ' re paying attention to when you do this manually. For example, in the line you ' ve posted, is `p937blksdh3` the message - id ? __label__1 It didn ' t crash for me. What errors are you getting when it crashes ? __label__1 Do you live in the US? How excited are people about the album ? __label__1 Likewise there is some discussion at <url>, where <url> is categorising itself and its documenttation. Could you please fix that as well ? __label__1 Ha, you ' re too kind to me, my old friend. MK one day, promise ? __label__1 Please explain science behind "the darker the color of the metal of the muffin tin the more it will brown its contents" in relation to being in a domestic oven ? __label__1 To clarify - the retain count is 1 after initWithNibName and 4 after pushViewController.. Any ideas ? __label__1 I think I ' m going to use Treehouse of Horror for Halloween (Scorpion asked me in IRC for that date). How about October 30 or Nov 1 instead ? __label__1 I think the we ' ve reached consensus in the FAC for <url>, as every opposing reason has been resolved. Do you think it ' s looking good ? __label__1 Which logs? The logs in the question are my Nginx ones which Passenger is set to write to, are there any others around I should check? :)__label__1 This is a relative path, what means, that it is resolved against the current working directory (`getcwd()`). Did you checked the absolute path also (`realpath()`)?__label__1 are the images stored in the same base folder that the jquery is in? or are they in a different folder ? __label__1 Could you tell us more about the "protective plates"?__label__1 Do you think <url> warrants instant removal? I ' d rather not leave the article there until after the election, in the interests of fairness to other non - noteable candidates do you think instant removal is warranted ? __label__1 Can I you take a look at <url> and <url>? Specifically, look at the formatting of the general reference; is it an acceptable way to present the references ? __label__1 While this is obviously possible, it is far from trivial if you want it to look decent. Can you maybe get away with having several pre - rotated tower images and flip between those ? __label__1 Someone has moved this article to <url>. Can you please move it back ? __label__1 I ' d really like to keep the image, just because it ' s of a Medal of Honor winner. Is there a way to shrink the table, or another place in the article (Like the Footnotes section) where the image would work ? __label__1 Can you show what you ' re written so far? Is there a specific roadblock you ' re encountering ? __label__1 commented out the for loop and it compiles fine so it should be the problem. just read somewhere that maybe i should be using a constant iterator ? __label__1 What do you mean? The best OS to do Arduino development on, or the best OS to run on your Arduino (a la FreeRTOS)?__label__1 Sorry, I was wondering if the are related to each other or separate organizations? Also is there a difference between North Twillingate and Twillingate ? __label__1 Crap, I ' m sorry, I didn ' t realize someone was working on it, and it ' s done now, sorry to get your hopes up. No dramas ? __label__1 Do you have any code we can look at? What have you tried so far that isn ' t working ? __label__1 That is awesome! I would love to see bikes like that on sale and on the roads over here. Interesting that the frame geometry is 'relaxed' a lot more than most UK bikes. Any idea on price ? __label__1 @George: I have started a project which uses your wrapper .. it appears that the site name is hard coded, but can easily be passed in as a parameter. Do you have plans to change this to be configurable ? __label__1 A quick question, I ' d like your opinion on something. Do you think I should put <url> GAN on hold or fail it ? __label__1 What does it mean that you want "the variation between routes" as small as possible? Could you rephrase the question ? __label__1 The classes are still not indented properly. Can you post the fixed code so people would see what trouble you ' re having ? __label__1 For a single one - off script, for a web project (e . g. Rails, Sinatra, or other) or are you creating utility code that you want available for many scripts ? __label__1 D - Wave! Have your lecturers recommended their technology to you ? __label__1 I ' m not seeing a reason why it should be much slower then the 9 seconds. Can you provide a sample of the file you are reading ? __label__1 @Juan yeah, i figured it was something like that. Where is this magical chat room anyway ? __label__1 Thanks! To be absolutely fair his earlier edits to Rumble Fighter seemed serious; maybe he left the pc untended ? __label__1 Hi, I missed your valued contributions recently. Everything ok ? __label__1 question is unclear. perhaps including an example will help ? __label__1 I like the image of the Finnish lighthouses. Do you know if it is for sale anywhere as a poster ? __label__1 <url> reminded me of a report I want to file about Asad. May I ? __label__1 Thanks; it just occurred to me to cite USGS maps, but this is maybe even better. Was there once an airplane crash in the vicinity, or are there maps like this for all parts of the country ? __label__1 This is exactly what I am looking for: http://limi . net / articles / resource - packages/. Does anybody know where to find more information about this ? __label__1 Despite my best efforts, I ' ve been unable to find the coordinates for the <url>: it ' s a specific little spot somewhere on a rail line between two villages, 3 miles apart. Is the "coord missing" template appropriate, since they ' re missing, or is it inappropriate, since I believe that no reliable source has that information ? __label__1 So your .click listener / handler is functioning correctly (you can do other things within it?) and it ' s only your $.get function that has an issue inside the handler ? __label__1 Right from the first version you created, this article says she was born in both 1976 and 1985! Could you sort it out, please ? __label__1 There are many varieties of "useful". What do you need / want these books for ? __label__1 I think I ' ll leave it to the Math WikiProject to decide whether the dab page should be at <url> or <url> since they ' ll be more familiar with the importance of the various functions. It looks like all of the basic options I was considering are basically OK from the perspective of the DAB project, right ? __label__1 If you have time could you look at <url><url> on the <url> article. I ' m wondering what your thoughts are in terms whether it should go or stay ? __label__1 ElendilTheTall - Please read my comment to the question. Can you explain why the focus supposedly locks when the camera is in Auto mode (are things different with Nikon)?__label__1 All, I have some ideas for Palm Springs meetup locations (just by looking on Yelp). Should I start a question in main or meta, add my locations as answers so people can vote and also add their ideas for meetup locations ? __label__1 <url> is brand new and may need some attention. I thought you might be just the person who can help get that article at least secured against SPOD - attacks ? __label__1 smalltalk is something I am looking into. Does Smalltalk / X work as in interpreter until you compile ? __label__1 Do you have any thoughts on renaming the page to reflect that the notability (and most of the content) is about the labor dispute / takeover, etc. than the company itself ? __label__1 +1 for Python. Maybe consider doing this for some other SE sites ? __label__1 I ' m afraid it ' s still unclear what you want to do with roomA and roomB. Are you trying to list every permuation of the two ? __label__1 you should post your xml layout here. What you have implemented so far ? __label__1 Are you using the default expression evaluator? Also have you tried applying the line directive to the ret instead of a nop ? __label__1 Yes, I ' m delighted; result after a torturous few days! Um, can we add a Dali or Miro img ? __label__1 At <url>, you ' ve added from Bacon a line saying that the addition of 3 minor judges to the list of major judges brings the total to 12. But the numbers don ' t work out - not in the list in the article, anyway. I don ' t want to revert your good - faith (and referenced) edit, but could you go back to your source and see if you can fix this ? __label__1 @Mr blue: it ' s possible that this question makes sense to those with an HCI background, but my gut tells me it doesn ' t. Can you elaborate on your question ? __label__1 how are the arrays of characters "combined". Can you give a few example result strings or pseudocode ? __label__1 @Mat is there a NOP for oracle? how can I abort the statements from being executed from within the trigger ? __label__1 @luser droog: I can surely try! where can I look at that source ? __label__1 Thanks for the correction but I am still working on the table. Could you hold off for a bit so our edits don ' t cross ? __label__1 The source on the Daniel Larsson page looks good enough. Perhaps someone at Swedish interwiki might know of other sources ? __label__1 Perhaps ''polemic'' was an unwise choice of words on my part: I meant it in the very narrow sense of an opposing theologian, but you are right, the more usual sense is of a confrontational piece of writing. I ' ll substitute ''tract''..?__label__1 Can you post your declaration of the `share` property? Does it retain the value assigned ? __label__1 Is your current code snippet working for you? If not, do you have a simple sample config file you could post ? __label__1 You ask about a "tag". Is that tag from Wordpress or does the NextGEN gallery has it ' s own tagging mechanism ? __label__1 A very good explanation. Thanks. Which 'degrees' are those? Fahrenheit or Celcius ? __label__1 It works without errors. Can you please add a [minimal example](http://meta . tex . stackexchange . com / q / 228 / 1235) that illustrates your problem ? __label__1 Very weird indeed. Are there two newlines after each pubDate ? __label__1 Just a question about the maintenance categories that FemtoBot automatically creates each month: I ' ve noticed that the bot is frequently forced to recreate old, long - deleted monthly categories in the <person> queue, because an article got reverted to an old version for one reason or another and resulted in the old category being temporarily repopulated again. I ' m just putting this forward as an idea for discussion, and am certainly not wedded to it u2014 but just to keep things simpler for everyone, I wonder what you would think about the feasibility and / or desirability of recoding the bot so that when it encounters a repopulated old maintenance category, it would retag the article to the ''current'' month instead of recreating the old one ? __label__1 Thank you that clarifies matters. Has the image been listed for deletion on commons, or should I do so ? __label__1  - 1: I ' ve read that book too. Can you please be more specific about how the message in that book addresses this question ? __label__1 @kelton52, then the problem is at compile time rather than run time. There should still be behaviour, error messages from the compiler perhaps ? __label__1 Thanks, but I am now having trouble finding it. Any suggestions ? __label__1 Interesting illustration on the PrIze law page of a Zeppelin taking a Norwegian vessel as a prize in 1917. I wonder whether you could point me to a source for more information on this incident ? __label__1 I ' ve been saying it has to win that award for a few weeks :) I ' d be very shocked if it didn ' t win. Who hands out that particular award ? __label__1 Thanks for the pointer, but now I am not sure to understand your problem. Could you add a drawing ? __label__1 I once saw someone touch the (house ) radiator to discharge before working inside a PC. Does that really help ? __label__1 @Cyber: What was that adequate solution? Could you post it in detail, for people in the future who have this problem ? __label__1 It ' s possible. Do you have any code yet ? __label__1 The only books by Paul I was able to find were ''Concordia the Lutheran Confessions: A Readers Edition of the Book of Concord'' (Hardcover - not yet released) and ''Communion fellowship: A resource for understanding, implementing, and retaining the practice of closed communion in the Lutheran parish'' (Unknown Binding - Jan 1, 1992). Are those his scholarly works ? __label__1 Matt H ' s comment covers the "how". As for "Is it legal?"..__label__1 I was thinking more of making the line longer so that the team ' s name can fit on it. Is that doable ? __label__1 Ah.. Hmm. Would it be possible to wrap it in Jython somehow to make it a Java applet using the code I wrote ? __label__1 I don ' t understand the reason for <url>. Would you please explain it to me ? __label__1 Do you have any module that changes the menu? May you provide a list of installed modules ? __label__1 Are you wanting a single array when this algorithm finishes? E . g. an array which stores all elements from `a`, `b` and `c` in a sorted order ? __label__1 This still shows old and read messages. How do you fix that ? __label__1 @Paul W they all just pass through, there ' s no getting off early. would you think it would be ok to change the initial call to somewhere further down the line to skip a few but use the main interface still ?__label__1 showing some code would greatly help e . g. how did you declare 'path'?__label__1 Ok, this a long - shot, just a crazy idea, and I haven ' t tried it myself, so I won ' t submit it as an answer: How about keeping the UIImageView stationary and moving the UIView around behind it? You might then be able to use transforms to translate or scale your UIView, and transform the scrollview at the same time ? __label__1 Otherwise, very nice article. Are you going to submit it to DYK ? __label__1 Yes, this is infuriating.. Prevents me making a single command for Big - Oh notation that can handle both simple and tall formulae. How on earth was this overlooked??__label__1 If you can remember, would you mind giving a bit more information about this photo e . g. where you took it ? __label__1 My context is: I want to capture an image which has width = 300px, height = 300px in android. how can I do this ? __label__1 I wonder if it would ever be worth doing an article on G & S scholarship? You know, cover the major discoveries, describe the evolution of the field.. or is that too likely to hit problems ? __label__1 Perhaps showing some more of your code would help us help you? Also what the file hierarchy look like for relevant files ? __label__1 I don ' t understand what you mean by "random oracles, which are non - recursive sets." Do you mean that a random oracle is non - recursive with probability 1 ? __label__1 thanks for working on that. but.. what is the difference between what you added to the intro, and what was already written below ? __label__1 there is no good way to do this in general. Are there any conditions that you can give ? __label__1 I ' ve started an article called <url>. Would you be able to do a good intro paragraph ? __label__1 Perhaps something else is receiving the request before your option page? AKA, the background page ? __label__1 I have an application . xml file but not sure how exactly how to use it. Have I missed some settings ? __label__1 Saw your edits on <url> - all good - but I have a question. What does "collapse <url>" mean in your edit summary ? __label__1 This is a big discussion ("Neil said..") and then a small question ("Please, state the stand and then its advantages.") A better question might be "What ' s the best kind of kickstand for [lifting the rear wheel / loading groceries / etc.]?"__label__1 This already works in the summary column in the debugger window or inline data tip when you hover over the variable in your editor. Am I misunderstanding your question ? __label__1 Please present your work: what have you done to debug the Count signal? How do the other signals in the design behave ? __label__1 do the restaurant ones have sauce on the top? Or do they just put some cheese on and whack it under the grill ? __label__1 No offense @Jack but this seems largely argumentative. Do you think you could rephrase it ? __label__1 Please clarify your question a bit. Are you just asking how to invoke an instance ' s methods ? __label__1 Although I didn ' t know that there is such a function in sql. Are there any others like this ? __label__1 Definitely not, mainly because no such lens exists. Did you mean EF 70 - 200 f / 4 L or EF - S 18 - 200 f / 3 . 5 - 5 . 6 ? __label__1 Thanks for the good advice. I still think the electric - shock - button idea is a good one though :-) You been having problems with images as well ? __label__1 This sounds familiar. Was this discussed on SO within the past two months or was it on programmers . SE ? __label__1 I ' m probably going to be sorry I asked, but what ' s a BA? "Bachelor of Arts", "Benefits Administrator", "Bad Ass"?__label__1 Hi, I borrowed your bit on Rauls Razor for my userpage. I hope thats okay ? __label__1 Great question; too bad none of the answers have any clues to the origin though. There must be countless words which can approximate one second, so why the name of a southern US state ? __label__1 Are you packing boxes into box - shaped bins? Can you rotate boxes to make them fit ? __label__1 looks like it ' s a conflict with the Prototype library, which we introduced in the newer version. Any ideas how to stringify a json object containing an array under Prototype ? __label__1 Thanks for letting me know. Is it considered a subspecies ? __label__1 So what is the final verdict? What would be the best technology to use in my case ? __label__1 What do you have so far? How are you storing what you get out of Nokogiri ? __label__1 I think for #1 for sequential search the number is (n+1)/2. Is that right ? __label__1 Can you provide a simple test file (with valid referenced SVG) showing this problem? Have you considered fetching the SVG source and [appending that document to the page](http://groups . google . com / group / svg - web / browse _ thread / thread / 363d599b7eb5a517) instead of as a referenced element ? __label__1 Are you looking for a total ordering? or just an ordering ? __label__1 That might be very helpful. How can I get it ? __label__1 That should work. What is the error you are getting ? __label__1 No problem. Have you seen the <url> article ? __label__1 I didn ' t quite understand, what are you trying to achieve? What questions do you have and what is the desired output ? __label__1 Great job. Will it be done by next week ? __label__1 Also perhaps we should set up a subpage for these discussions, so we ' ll have the thread completely on one page? What do you think ? __label__1 I finished my expansion of the category you created. Any suggestions on how to improve the category ? __label__1 Can you please clarify your goals? Is pure - Perl what ' s important to you, or is zero - installation important ? __label__1 Maybe you are using an extremely old version of jQuery or the script is built weirdly. Are you getting any error messages ? __label__1 Can you write the URL of this page? Also, does it have any kind of authentication on it ? __label__1 can you please focus your question a bit? Perhaps you could ask what the advantages and disadvantages are for touring in Greece ? __label__1 OS? OpenGL implementation vendor? Can you post a complete, minimal program that demonstrates the problem ? __label__1 The article that you reference does a good job explaining this: "the SortedDictionary ( TKey, TValue) generic class is a binary search tree with O ( log n) retrieval, where n is the number of elements in the dictionary.". Did you have a more specific question or answer that you were looking for ? __label__1 Before you get into the run - time of the algorithm, do you understand what it is supposed to do? Do you see how it works ? __label__1 Hi Dirk. Does the two books you cited for the heavy Belgian <url> losses have any info of how many Gladiators the Belgians lost, and perhaps what losses they incurred on the Germans ? __label__1 It does seem a bit weird. You weren ' t doing it on a secondary thread by any chance ? __label__1 How do you define minimal? The minimum number of movements or the minimum of the sum of distances / squares of the distances ? __label__1 Thanks for the answer. However I don ' t have a grill, can I cook it on a pan? Why medium - well is not properly cooked ? __label__1 how do you load the php file? Are the folder / file permissions set to executable ? __label__1 Anytime. How do you like this closer crop ? __label__1 A DVT is tailored to a design. What is the design ? __label__1 Thanks, this was easier to understand. Can you please add a few more lines to last three definitions ? __label__1 This is likely to be a shell misconfiguration, probably the lack of prompt protection [suggested by mikel](http://unix . stackexchange . com / questions / 6580 / why - is - gnu - screen - byobu - leaving - garbage - text - in - the - shell - during - a - reverse - sear / 6581 # 6581). What shell are you using (probably bash, but please confirm)?__label__1 Thank you. Could you please describe it more in detail or send some link dealing with logos in this software ? __label__1 Hi, I wanted to ask what do you follow to create redirects on this <url>??__label__1 What do you call a keyword? Every [long enough] word in a string ? __label__1 Hi, the article states that Mongolian Cyrillic is a phonemic script. Is this so in respect to Inner Mongolian dialects ? __label__1 I ' m not sure I understand exactly what you want. Could you clarify ? __label__1 I ' m not sure I understand what you mean by the first bullet item. Can you elaborate ? __label__1 What platform are you coding for? iPhone / iPad or Mac in general ? __label__1 thanks for the reply. Would it contradict any guidelines to change it everywhere to "TWO SQ BRACKETS" NEWNAME|the name relevant in the article "TWO SQ BRACKETS" (with the hope that the name won ' t change again before the article is created)?__label__1 Yea - I deleted my line numbers request comment when I read the log again - I was on completely the wrong track with that! However, I still would consider the xib a suspect - it might be NSDecoding properties that don ' t exist anymore in the class ? __label__1 Can you please post some code. How is data received at the client side ? __label__1 Hi Darwi. Just to ask you as curiosity, how did that debate ended ? __label__1 Is there anything else in specific you would like to know about the selecting coffee beans for roasting ? __label__1 I see the dilemma with separate series.. in the case with (untranslated) Spirou there are no such problems, but it seems to make more sense, with no english publication, to switch the brackets for english and original titles (ex: <url>). Does this create a problem with continuity ? __label__1 How is your DAL structured? Is there only one Assembly ? __label__1  * Find a random element* sounds like picking a random element. But I assume you want to find a *specific* element in the array, right ? __label__1 I assume that when you rotate them, they have to remain axis - aligned? i . e. you can ' t rotate then by 30 degrees or anything like that ? __label__1 Hello Alex! Since you are experienced in ''botovodstvo'', could you help us with the issue <url>?__label__1 I ' m on it. Instead, could I persuade you to offer comments on the FAC page of <url>?__label__1 It ' s double the disambiguation.. Might be an overkill. What do you say ? __label__1 Just make a Facebook account? I thought other sites would just offer it if they can, you can ' t really force them can you ? __label__1 sorry folks, i didn ' t know how to use the community wiki box. can this be reopened as i ' ve moved it over ? __label__1 Is the image an animated gif which finishes in less than a second? Or is it corrupted ? __label__1 Could it be a permissions issue? Does your cron job have privileges in /var/ ?__label__1 Looking at my various edit summaries to <url>, I don ' t see any where I mentioned anything about another example. Can you say which edit you have in mind ? __label__1 Hi. How do you think, is <url> of FL quality ? __label__1 i ' ve checked the values at the return statement..they ' re valid..but once it actually returns i get nothing. is this something to do with scope ? __label__1 I ' d think just changing `count(*)` to `count ( issues.*)` would be what you ' re looking for, right ? __label__1 Can you provide more context for your second code example? Specifically, how is $doc defined ? __label__1 I thought about leaving it as a hint to anyone else that restarting VS can always solve unexpected problems. What do you think ? __label__1 The cover art image shows annual #2 (1983), and says "introducing superwoman". Is that what you were looking for ? __label__1 I want to send you a private message, but you don ' t have an e - mail address registered with your Wikipedia account. How could I contact you ? __label__1 u2013 Use that dash my friend. How are you geting on ? __label__1 Please be a little more clear? do you have the printer attached to the ubuntu machine or the Windows XP machine ? __label__1 @Mike: I don ' t know Java yet.

Or do they have more complex shapes ? __label__1 Elkman, there are other ways to take a Wikibreak. Can I help ? __label__1 This error implies something wrong with how the app itself is running, not with finding the template. Is there any traceback data ? __label__1 Hi Fropuff. How do you convert your commutative diagrams from LaTeX to PNG ? __label__1 I ' m see about the new Version 0 . 7 - which stated should FINALLY be published soon.. When the exact date it published? Is there anything that I can help ? __label__1 Do you get any sort of error in Instruments when you plugin your iOS device? Is your iPhone Developer Program Membership up to date ? __label__1 and @Nico: Have you tried my solution? Did it fix the problem ? __label__1 it sounds like HTML Agility pack will probably work for me. Are there any other options??__label__1 I don ' t get your question to be honest. Could you clarify it more please ? __label__1 What are you trying to optimize? Do you want to minimize the number of sets ? __label__1 As I wrote above, at first I thought lets keep it, but after I heard some arguments, and when I made analysis of my own, I got to my conclusion. What ' s yours ? __label__1 I am trying to figure out the exact definition of <url> however do not have access to Andrews. Could you help ? __label__1 Hey can this thing emit human language? I mean like words ? __label__1 What exactly fails? What error are you getting ? __label__1 Despite our long - standing disagreement, I have no argument with you <url>. However, can I suggest you use a less opaque edit summary than ''added info'' when doing something that is nonetheless controversial ? __label__1  " Too localized?" How does that apply to this question ? __label__1 <url> and I was wondering if you have worked on that project at all recently, or whether you know of any other open - source projects that implement your idea. Also, do you have any Wikibooks that you ' ve written ? __label__1 what ' s the raw information you have?.. i . e. how did you come to two DORs ? __label__1 So, your app creates a new html for each login? Or for each user ? __label__1 Do you release the gameViewController later on? And are resetLevel and resetTheGame methods clean ? __label__1 The same way anyone with a desk job stays healthy! This isn ' t really programmer - related ? __label__1  " pyparsing" appears to be a word specific to Python. Is there a more general programming term for that type of action ? __label__1 So, the canvas was causing the move to upper left, but removing the canvas still has one of the classes assuming it knows better where to place images, and it ' s letting me push them outside the bounds of the control. Any suggestions ? __label__1 Nice. What kind of improvement ? __label__1 Even till today I could not get the solution. Is there anyone who has done this before ?__label__1 Yes I can. Is it an alternate account ? __label__1 We already have a related (not a duplicate) question: [http://bicycles . stackexchange . com / q / 1055 / 8](http://bicycles . stackexchange . com / questions / 1055 / which - states - or - countries - have - stop - sign - as - yield - laws - for - bicyclists - idaho - stop), but we never got a good summary of locations where the Idaho Stop was implemented--unless it ' s really only Idaho that has this law. Maybe make this a question asking how the law has worked out in these locations ? __label__1 I just logged in for the first time this weekend. Do you want me to run through or have you already started ? __label__1 That link isn ' t working for me. Can you check it ? __label__1 The large coat of arms is still be commented on.

Can you fix it ? __label__1 Would you be willing to do another pre - FAC review of a different article for me? Specifically, the "John J.

Could you please edit it to complete your question ? __label__1 Wouldn ' t the time complexity depend on the type of tree?

Are they not a feature of the test instrument rather than that of the sample being tested ? __label__1 4. I had once felt that the Euroleague, Italian and Greek leagues were the top leagues. If I were to choose selected European leagues from this page <url>, do you have any thoughts on which ones are important ? __label__1 Hello, again. Would you care to intervene at <url>?__label__1 @ikegami: Can you suggest an easier one for beginners? SOAP::Lite seems to be advocated as 'the easiest' all around ? __label__1 I tend not to be an RFC closer -- apologies. Hopefully someone else will ? __label__1 You may want to post the code right here. Maybe use pastebin or something if it ' s too much to embed directly in your post ? __label__1 Is it ok to use words like: here are some "good" or "recommended" reliable secondary sources? Or does that have to be determined by consensus ? __label__1 Wanted to Email you about Wikimedia Converence Netherlands, but your email is not working. In any case, you could crash at our place ? __label__1 I think it ' s time we considered a perma - block on the IP in question. Comments ? __label__1 @David: By the way, I hate to state the obvious, but just looking at the regions you selected in your graph, it looks like you chose the area in the lowest quartile. Is that a sufficient criteria ? __label__1 What do you think? And how does one go about establishing this project group ? __label__1 Why is it an HTML file? Also can you please show the JSON ? __label__1 That ' s odd that only certain notifications fire. How are you setting up the observers ? __label__1 Is the `.linkQuantite` element a child of the `<tr>` element? Does it work when you do `$(this).parent('tr').attr('class'));`?__label__1 It sounds like you are using some kind of survey engine.

PC or XBox ? __label__1 @cvondrick, in that case I ' d rather use binary insertion and sorting. My problem now, is however how I can combine two dates to one number ? __label__1 Oh, that ' s because I only copyedited a tiny section of the article. Should I still count that as a yes ? __label__1 I thought our short conversation last evening showed that cooperation might be possible. Was I wrong ? __label__1 In that case it might not be the answer then (hence the comment). Are you using the VS web server or IIS Express ? __label__1 Hi I saw that you make maps and plans. Could you make me some that good plans, of station ? __label__1 Also, If we replace the maps with an image of a monument, then we could eliminate the architecture part.

Can we modify its contents, while still providing an answer relative to the original **S**?__label__1 @Bob Murphy: Yeap, you see, *I ' m sorry* is used waay too often, and usually it doesn ' t mean that someone is sorry - it ' s just a protocol keyphrase. Do we need protocol keyphrases where real action and attitude is what ' s actualy needed ? __label__1 One of them writes to /dev / tty, one of them writes to STDOUT. Was that what you wanted to know ? __label__1 Call me a little dense. Do you mean there has to be the same number of Songs, articles, albums, and bio ' s on the portal for the portal to work ? __label__1 @Peter Shor: Of course. Doesn ' t everyone ? __label__1 Is the crop operation cheap? If you already have the image on disk you could just pass the XML filename and the crop parameters into the .ashx as a query string and do the crop again in the .ashx ? __label__1 so the airport is in one feature class, and the destination in another feature class? You wish to join all airports to all destinations ? __label__1 Hey Dan, I see you around but we haven ' t talked in a bit. What are you up to these days ? __label__1 You recently deleted my photograph of Harrington, NSW stating 'blatant copyright infringement', I ' m not sure how you came to this conclusion as I took this photograph myself and authorise it for use under a creative commons licence. I ' m no expert at Wikipedia and am not sure how to get the photograph back; would you be able to restore the image and the link to it on the Harrington, NSW Wikipedia page ? __label__1 What approaches did you try? What were the problems ? __label__1 Hi Novice.

Can you check that ? __label__1 Should the "accessdate" for the articles you found (thanks for that!) be 200''7''?__label__1 I have already read this - thank you very much for this kind gesture, dear friend.

Is there any matter you need help with ? __label__1 Could you please give me a reference, that 95% should lie between -1 . 96 ; 1 . 96 . In other words, why should standardized residuals be $d _ i \ sim N ( 0 , 1)$?__label__1 Hypothetically, if course A and course B each have max size of 1, and five people list preference of AB, three people won ' t get into either preference.

What was the exact error ? __label__1 You ' re just discarding any useful exceptions that download() will throw - Image . open() might be trying to read "" being returned by download(), which would explain the current error you ' re receiving. If you remove that try..catch block, do you receive any more informative errors ? __label__1 Hi Cm, I noticed your edits with the edit summary "unicodify" when removing mdash and ndash. Are you sure this is correct and are you preserving the n / m distinction ? __label__1 How are the stops designated? Do they have unique numbers or names ? __label__1 Your file logic looks fine. What ' s happening in the `<snip>` between opening and closing ? __label__1 Sounds good then. In this case, would it be wise to simply remove the "influence" field since it simply overlaps with "subjects"?__label__1 You ' ll need a serverside to do that. What are you using on the backend ? __label__1 lol thanks. so, australia, huh ? __label__1 I don ' t know about Eclipse, but Visual Studio puts it on the right - button menu. Perhaps Eclipse is the same ? __label__1 Other than that I think the artical is ready to go. What say you ? __label__1 What do you think? Is there a mistake somewhere ? __label__1 Hi Eugene, long ago you made a dump of missing articles at <url>. Are you able to produce a new dump like this, as it needs a refresh, otherwise can you point me to how it is done ? __label__1 Are you hardcoding the node id in the "second" method but it won ' t load the node? Or is the question why you aren ' t getting that node id in the "second" method ? __label__1 Not sure what you are referring to when you say you need an SQL query builder for "Python".

If you have a chance, could you look this over ? __label__1 Thanks, was getting worried there for a moment. Have you though of asking Outriggr for a hand with <url>?__label__1 Well.. pretty much most of what was in the old table, and the category links. May I get in touch with you via e - mail to work on the specifics ? __label__1 Stephen ' s solution certainly isn ' t optimal.

How do you do that ? __label__1 I ' ve tweaked it further: It ' s now accurate, to within my ability to describe a complicated subject, but rather too complicated. Can we simplify it without losing precision, or, alternately, put something before the precise definition that ' s a bit easier to understand ? __label__1 That would be awesome. Do you want to ask someone for clarification on whether project sandboxes are allowed ? __label__1 Correct, the ranges are intended to be discontinuous. I think if ranges were continuous, then it would really be just one range, without any breaks / gaps, correct ? __label__1 I am running Windows 7. What built - in tools should I look for ? __label__1 One other question I have is that the ''Wikipedia'' article states that his 1968 paper had been first rejected by American publications before it was accepted by the British one. Would you happen to know why ? __label__1 Any particular reason you ' re after a Nikon? Is it just so you can borrow your friend ' s lenses ? __label__1 Version 2 . 6 . 6. Is this addressed in a newer version ? __label__1 I ' m having the exact same problem. Did you ever find a solution ? __label__1 Windows, Python 2 . 6, Cython 0 . 14, Gcc 4 . 5 . 1. Could you post your 2d code ? __label__1 Sorry its not clear but what are you considering for alternatives? Are you trying to decide between a desktop client and a web client or considering Winforms over WPF ?__label__1 ErrorDocument 404 index . php This does not seem to work for me. Any ideas ? __label__1 I understand, it could be quite time consuming. Maybe we could do a collab for an article related to Thalia (once I ' m finished with some work)?__label__1 Reverted again, you need to create your own subpage at Template talk : Did you know / Article name.

Can you point me to a page that has such a feature ? __label__1 Are you using an IDE in your group? Like Eclipse or Netbeans ? __label__1 I think your best option would be to redesign so that you don ' t have to do this. What is this design intended to accomplish ? __label__1 Yeah- using a stack for depth first. Did you know that you use a queue for breadth first ? __label__1 Hi, I am having problems with one of the references you added as it goes to the main page and not to one showing any of the figures on religion. Can you have a look at <url>?__label__1 If an edge connecting the graph to a leaf node is to be deleted, is it assumed to delete the leaf node as well? Alternatively, does deleting a leaf node also delete the edge connecting it to the rest of the graph ? __label__1 Hi- The Magnificent Clean - keeper- I note that you recently removed a contribution I made to the <url> page, citing lack of "notability" as the reason. Iu2019m not saying you where wrong to do so (notability is an important criteria in the Wiki project), however, since the definition of "notability" is hard to pin down, could we discuss this particular instance, in greater detail, at some point ? __label__1 I think this deserves its own article, as opposed to being in the centrifugal one. Do you have any good sources that describe how it works ? __label__1 Please, add the first part to your post. You mean both players should have the same number of parts of the stick ? __label__1 Hey Jondel. I was wondering, since Interlingua is basically resurrected Latin, k and w are basically nonexistant in Interlingua, right ? __label__1 I don ' t understand what ' s wrong with the standard C pre - processor. Can you clarify ? __label__1 Meant to ask -- what do you mean by whether the JVM can remember the order of the nodes? If you use a List, isn ' t it the JVM implementing the list for you ? __label__1 I could take a peek, at least. What problems are you having ? __label__1 Hi. Would you be interested in reviewing <url> for its GA nomination ? __label__1 Is there any further information you ' ll need for a proper answer to this ? __label__1 Hi Bruce, I normally make only trivial changes, but I ' ve just found it necessary to do two hook rewrites. Could you check, please ? __label__1 It might be useful to clarify the meaning of “good” in the title of the question. What is wrong with using BNF to describe a DCFL ? __label__1 Hello, I ' ve written a page about the <url>, shamelessly copying the style from your CCT / FoFC lists. In the process, have I missed anything out ? __label__1 What kind of shell tools are available? E . g., awk, pure bash, perl, python, .. ?__label__1 This is hard to answer without more context - what is your threat model, your application, etc? A general answer is at http://security . stackexchange . com / questions / 1476 / what - is - the - difference - in - security - between - a - vpn - and - a - ssl - connection so can you look at the answers there and either get clarity on those answers there, or ask more specific questions here ? __label__1 could you email me when you get a chance? not having any luck this end, must be spam filters blocking ? __label__1 I added a clarifying sentence to my user page <url>. Do you think it distills the essence ? __label__1 <url>. Congrats, or should I say good luck ? __label__1 It ' s weird that this doesn ' t work on Python 3 . 1, could you share more about your directory structure and module organization?

I ' ve gotten a few of these since then, but just wondering if you remembered and got any shots that would be worth using on here ? __label__1 This question really doesn ' t satisfy the guidelines of the site. Can you please read the FAQ and then edit this question ? __label__1 Thanks for the tip. How come I sometimes come across pages where the trailing 's' is left off (or am I confusing that with the 's situation)?__label__1 Thanks, I tried to do that but don ' t know how to do it? Can you help ? __label__1 I believe your question could have some validity, can you please elaborate on the scope of your question. Are you speaking in reference to the exchange of electrons or are you speaking in more of a supernatural aspect ? __label__1 I saw on the status page that you have a free spot. Would you be able to coach me ? __label__1  " Everything works except I can ' t register ANY mouseup / down events." Do you get an error, or does it just not work ? __label__1 At what point in this process did you discover the MBP was unplugged? Is the problem continuing to happen after the MBP is fully recharged ? __label__1 How many is "several different"? How big are |L| and |S|, relatively / absolutely? ~~__label__1 "\n" for replacement. Did you mean space or newline ? __label__1 sorry my bad english , its not what i ws looking for becuase everything i would have to include a shortcode after more tag in the post editor, but it can do that work. So its not possible to just work on some function which will automatically put some text / code after the more tag in the post page ?__label__1 Thinking up good names is sometimes very hard. Why don ' t you post two examples and solicit names ? __label__1 Would you email me with any points / incidents you especially want me to be aware of? Do you think Jimbo will be willing to pass this to the arbitration committee ? __label__1 Any hints, ideas, clues. Why am I not able to install again to the real device ?__label__1 Sorry, I understand, the bot has just moved the category of the sub - cat, not merged it. Is the bot going to proceed to the next layer - or does that have to be done manually ? __label__1 Hey .. the cookies are fried ! Why the "baking" tag?? :D__label__1 I apologise, I didn ' t actually see the message on my talk page, I assumed you meant the article talk page. If you are concerned that the "free" image has been uploaded under a false license, then perhaps you could nominate it for deletion ? __label__1 Is the set of tasks known in advance, or are more tasks being added as you go? Do you have have to worry about starvation (for example, a task with high c _ i never getting run if low c _ i tasks keep getting added)?__label__1 what problem are you having? what error are you getting ? __label__1 The major museums are in the nav box, but a casual reader might just read the section in the article; hence I think we should mention the major museums. Perhaps add another paragraph listing some of the smaller museums ? __label__1 By "implementing square", do you mean implementing a function such that `f ( x) = x^2`, or `f ( x) = x`? Also, what is the precise list of operators you are not allowed to use ? __label__1 unfortunately I can ' t do that. can anyone help ? __label__1 A photo might help. Into what does the vent screw ? __label__1 Note however that <url> does not exist. Which page were you talking about in this case ? __label__1 @Gnovice: I thought about that, but wasn ' t sure. I remember wondering the same thing a long time ago, so I figured, "why not"?__label__1 @Martin: I think modification of boot . efi wont be so risky, i can simply time machine back to my old system if anything goes wrong, right? Would u please provide me with modification instructions ? __label__1 The link you provided to speedy delection criteria only goes up to CSD12, and there is no CSD 13 listed there. Could you clarify ? __label__1 @Michael No it doesn ' t have to be jpeg based, but it needs a significant compression ratio as the reason we want to do compression is to significantly reduce the amount of data transferred. From what I know about LZ compression I wouldn ' t expect that on raw image data, but am I mistaken ? __label__1 Ron - I ' m interested in your edit comment here <url>. Your position is that RC is a sufficiently reliable source that anything it mentions is automatically notable ? __label__1 *@user1147* I edited your question heavily to try to make it more clear *(please review to make sure I didn ' t change the meaning.)* One thing I didn ' t understand was when you said *"when I open a single page to check post"*; can you be more clear what you meant by *"single page?"*__label__1 Thank you. It ' s a strange hobby, isn ' t it ? __label__1 Thanks. Any idea how I log into this account ? __label__1 Hi im currently compiling a college project on unreliable information and would like to view the deleted article Dudley O ' Neill.

Does the other syntax even work ?__label__1 what language should be responsible for creating the empty file? is it a bash shell script ? __label__1 Actually, if she is releasing a new single from the debut album, the title "Home Run" wouldn ' t encompass this. Someone else has changed it to "Debut album" which I think is more suiting, what do you think ? __label__1 Those look really cool! Do you keep it at the same temperature as your eggs ? __label__1 What programming language does this regard? Could you elaborate on "Get the same parts between"?__label__1 sorry, yeah, that ' s what my file looks like. Well, the '& ~' isn ' t indented, but that doesnt matter right ? __label__1 @Mark Trapp: Not constructive? Really ? __label__1 Hi, just noticed you reverted this page back to its pre - COPYVIO state. Any reason you didn ' t use the content at <url>?__label__1 Can you overlap jobs? If you have two three - unit jobs and six two - unit jobs, can you run the three - unit jobs sequentially on lane A, three two - unit jobs on B, and three two - unit jobs on C, taking six units of printing time in total ? __label__1 @fatih You don ' t happen to have a demo / example project you could share? To see which files need to be added and how to call the functions ? __label__1 Thanks. Now, if I had to make an infobox on "London" (just ''London'', I know there are many terms: Greater London, City of London etc), would it be correct to include the area / population / density of the territories I mentioned + the city area, or would just the city area suffice ? __label__1 I wonder why this is not possible by default, probably because the categories usage didn ' t need that in the past. Have you considered to add a feature request in [wordpress trac](http://core . trac . wordpress . org/)?__label__1 Are you sure to have more than 4 images / node? Also, are you the one behind http://ww . drupality . be ? __label__1 I would like to nominate you for adminship. Would you accept now ? __label__1 I ' d think the issue is that the tabs are starting from different column numbers because of longer and shorter filenames. Could you change it to `puts [OK]\t \ tx` so that the OKs line up and the filenames start at the same column ? __label__1 Ising ?? or Icing ??__label__1 This can be done in a number of ways. Do you want the user to select nodes to hide, or do you want certain nodes to be hidden from all users ? __label__1 One - way permutations are believed to exist (e . g., RSA). I suppose you are looking for negative results ? __label__1 I look forward to your genre plan. What do you have in mind ? __label__1 Probably a stupid question, but have you ensured that your machine resolves localhost correctly outside of java? At the CLI ? __label__1 @Xio Then you should explain which solution is better for you. Are you asking for an existing module that is not Views, or are you asking how to do it with a custom module ? __label__1 Seems okay to me. What is it supposed to output ? __label__1 Thanks for striking out the comment. Any chance of a support / oppose vote ? __label__1 Is there any chance you could post some of the code, with an indication of where your break point is? Is it possible that the break point is in a non - executing code path (in an if / else block, etc)?__label__1 Have you tried running it from the command line? `softwareupdate --list` to see if it spits out any errors ? __label__1 first thank you all for your answers second i cant understend jim why you think i try to make fun of you? and last how i mark that the problem solved ? __label__1 before I compose my answers to your questions, could you please explain what you mean by *"Lay a new thin layer of **gyps** (or some other material)"?* Also, would you be opposed to the new "concrete" screed layer being your finished balcony surface ? __label__1 Hi. The font - size for the links in this template may be on the small side, but it seems to be floating okay -- or do I need to check more places where it ' s used ? __label__1 Also - I just tested in chrome and it does exactly as I said above. No resize handles around the image when it is placed in the containment div and as soon as you click the image it jumps directly into the containment div - there is no smooth drag animation..?__label__1 I ' m going to remove it. Is that okay with you ? __label__1 I ' m not finding the name change request at <url>, nor does there appear to be such an edit under the "Rogerboas" account name. Did you posti t while logged out, perhaps ? __label__1 Sure. I have to warn you, though, the file size advantage has pretty much been lost since SVG font rendering went the way of the dinosaurs :) Do you make a point of having the border, or can I leave it out ? __label__1 After rereading the second code fragment, I changed my assumption to O ( N) * O ( N - 1) instead of O ( N) * O ( N+1) because the nested loop gets iterated one less time than the first loop, is this correct? So it would be O ( N ( N - 1)) == O ( N^2 - N) == O ( N^2)?__label__1 I ' m doing the same. Hey, can you please tell me if <url> has been fixed enough by being stub - ified ? __label__1 Can you please tell me how to use this PHP code and what it does ? __label__1 I think slicing means converting from derived class object to base class object. I think it is very common operation in C++, do you think slicing is a natural feature or a bad design ? __label__1 It may depend on the image file. If you Select All in the pdf, do you see the outline of the image ? __label__1 It ' s going to depend (to a large degree I would have thought) on the climate. Where are you ? __label__1 Just letting you know (since you have mentioned AFDing <url>) that weu2019ve gone to some effort to establish notability with <url>, and have added three reliable, notable, third - party sources to the article. Do you feel these sources establish <url> as being notable (<url> and all that)?__label__1 I ' m not sure what you are reffering to. Could you give a link ? __label__1 Is the set of points fixed? Will you fetch the closest 100 points for several differents locations, before set of points changes ? __label__1 Hi. Is there any chance of getting <url> unblocked from making edits on Wikipedia ? __label__1 A few more details are required. What ' s your latitude, longitude, date and timezone..?__label__1 Can you access http://swscan . apple . com / content / catalogs / index . sucatalog from your browser or using curl? (Just to rule out that you can talk to Apple ' s servers) and if have you tried deleting com . apple . SoftwareUpdate . plist in `/Library / Preferences/`?__label__1 Usually you ' d specify language in the tags (for example, HTML, CSS, PHP, etc.) What language are you using ? __label__1 It ' s great..!! Any plans for an iPad specific version ? __label__1 should pmf ( X) be the normalized frequency distribution of X? If yes, do we have any function in Matlab to compute it ? __label__1 Hi, hopefully I will have the <url> ''wonderful - joy - of - a - job'' task done by tomorrow so will be able to join you with the infobox - adding task thereafter. Do you have a method, or is it just A &ndash; Z ? __label__1 It seems that the string that I send is not null - terminated, could be this the problem? The string that I send is build with (string + string).c _ str(), but shouldn ' t the c _ str() method alredy add the NULL - terminator ? __label__1 I ' m not quite sure what you are trying to achieve. Do you want the background image to change only when you hover over the corners ? __label__1 Please take a look at Space Shuttle Discovery, for FPC. Will you reconsider ? __label__1 Welcome to IT Security. Do you have any security concern /questions about SLIP ? __label__1 @Stefan: Not sure what you mean by the comment above, sorry. Want to take it to chat ? __label__1 You are correct that the science is not copyright, but the purpose of the cite is <url>. If I want to check your equation, where should I look ? __label__1 Hi, I have cleaned up this page and, in the AfD, identified many other sources and additional content. I wonder if you would reconsider your delete !vote please (I will do the necessary expansion as and when there is a reasonable expectation of it being kept)?__label__1 Could you be a bit more specific? What do you mean by short key for scroll ? __label__1 Just a basic question - how many stacks of orders are we looking at? Also, how big are your sets, 100s of numbers, millions of numbers or more ? __label__1 I see you ' ve just placed a deletion request on your user page, but this page has no history and hasn ' t been edited previously. Did you mean to place it on the article you created, <url>?__label__1 Howdy Mattisse. Haven ' t I seen you on hockey articles, years ago ? __label__1 Could you provide some more precise input and output values? Do you want to convert "[link ] ww . yahoo . com[/link]" to "<a href='ww . yahoo . com'>ww . yahoo . com</a>"?__label__1 Just out of curiosity, how did you do the eye tracking? Are you open sourcing this code ? __label__1 I believe you beat me to several vandalism reverts the other night, so I thought I ' d give you this. We could all use more, right ? __label__1 Hi JoJan. I see that the template which listed the failed FA attempt on <url> was deleted from the talk page, and I wanted to ask if that is considered OK or not ? __label__1 Fair enough, thanks for assuming good faith, I was merely making the page consistant with the past 2 champions league season articles (<url>, <url>) which use path and non - champions instead of route and league. Should they be changed too or was that what they used to be called ? __label__1 hi Mustafaa I have some historical pictures and some sentences written on them which seems to be arabic. Can you tell me if it is arabic or not if i send you a copy ? __label__1 How about saying that the fastest flow is near the deepest part of the channel, and that in most meanders this is near the outer bank? What do you think ? __label__1 I think I might know how you could test to see if there ' s even a path between start and end, but don ' t know (at least not yet) how to calculate the least number of circles to remove. Would this be at all useful ? __label__1 Noticed your comments on the <url> talk page. What bands / styles are you into ? __label__1 Alright Mike - its been already posted on light house. Would you guys need any other things from me to recreate the error ? __label__1  ' prefab' really isn ' t a particular architectural style..it ' s a manufacturing process. Can you post a picture ? __label__1 @Herbert: Still I think your answer is very confusing. Can you please make it clearer that you ' re suggesting two completely different solutions, and indicate what is needed to make them work ? __label__1 Advice please (or do I approach my adopter about this?). I am tempted to put in the RN article that Lynn once appeared in a Leonard ad with the caption: 'Who else would listen to me bitch?" (I could try and find the issue where the ad appeared), but although relevant to the article, I suspect this could be seen as puffery, considering I started the article ? __label__1 I tried to create a similar map for Canada but couldn ' t get a usable output from the site you used for the Australia map. Could you create a Canadian one ? __label__1 Hi again - it looks like the same user is editing out all the information about Destiny being self - centred again. Is there some way we can stop this user from making these edits ? __label__1 For all downvoters, it may be that english it ' s not his native language. @varsha: You want to create such an application or you already have one and want to configure it ? __label__1 Then I think that we need to be a little poetic, rather than the rather prosaic "qualities associated with his weapons". What about something like "the magical properties attributed to his weapons"?__label__1 Sorry, I completely missed the subsection title. You think this is Merkey ? __label__1 Thanks. Beer ? __label__1 @Neil All data is input onto a screen before so there is no actual input data. Would it help if put the whole program here ? __label__1 Very nice. Did you visit also Romania or not ? __label__1 As an aside, do you do a lot of maintenance programming.. on your own code? How large, in LOC, are the projects you are working on ? __label__1  ( Off - topic:) Nope, this is a case of while i was writing the first one (in php) i accidentally created the second one, and was curious as to see if there was anything different, considering this has to validate 3 . 5 million cards in the next month 8D. which one is better in your mind ? __label__1 Can you explain your question a bit more, since if each node keeps track of nodes it is connected to, it looks like you have a graph that has connected components, and for each node type, find the number of connected components that node type is found in, the one present in most connected components is the type that has the longest unconnected chain. is that what you meant ? __label__1 What kind of input are you looking for, give little more details. [CommonDialog](http://msdn . microsoft . com / en - us / library / system . windows . forms . commondialog . aspx) look at the classes inheriting it do any of them look right for you ? __label__1 I really think that the text you have drafted at <url> is far fuller and better than the article as currently drafted. Do you have any objection to me deleting the current text (except for the infobox which I will retain) and importing you text in its entirety ? __label__1 Would you please clarify who you are referring to? Is this a follow up of a similar question ? __label__1 What are the project settings for the version you are debugging? For example, is the Debugging element defined so that there is a corresponding pdb file ? __label__1 If you ' re interested, I could provide you with Subversion (which is superior to CVS) for VandalProof. Interested ? __label__1 I think `chunklen` needs to also be able to decrease, or else your queue will have size proportional to its largest - ever size even if it is empty. So how about `if (q->head->next == q->tail) chunklen/=2`?__label__1 I actually posted my comments a couple minutes ago. Do you think that explanation works, or do you think it ' s a good idea I elaborate further ? __label__1 @Gulshan Sorry, obvious question - is there a reason this can ' t be a web application and / or done w/ something like Adobe Air ? __label__1 Is the junk always the same, or is it different for each file? Also, what format is the date in ? __label__1 Hi, Wereon - I ' m afraid I ' m rather amateur at nominating articles for deletion. Where do I start ? __label__1 @Jeremy: What happens if you add this line to your code - `alert({iframe : true, innerWidth : 425, innerHeight : 344}.iframe)`. Does view source give you the same code ? __label__1 I think if we did it that way, it would add a lot of possibilities to the page, enabling us to give breakdowns of other wars and major events in separate tables as well, in addition to alternative listings, which I think would be quite useful. Because there are a lot of events with different aspects to them that could be covered in more detail IMO, what do you think ? __label__1 Please clarify title / question. Do you wish to identify the start of a cycle, or remove a cycle ? __label__1 I went to <url> and couldn ' t find it. Can you provide a link ? __label__1 I think there are specs shown on the Vexilla Mundi website, if that helps. Are you happy for me to bring other such flags to your attention ? __label__1 At the Chicago house article, I think the current state of house music in its birthplace, Chicago, should be added. What do you think ? __label__1 Are you sure we don ' t know anything else about these elements? Do we even know if they are numbers or could they be arbitrary elements ? __label__1 I have always maintained a control of the military section and I can check up the names in the educational section. Which section would you like to clean - up ? __label__1 Could you post some of the relevant code? It would make it easier to figure out what is going on.. Also, what do you mean by "the Map"?__label__1 How lay are we talking about here? Do you have some knowledge of Galilean dynamics and Newtonian mechanics ? __label__1 Are you also interested in common real - world uses of other Public / Private key protocols besides RSA (e . g. DSA etc?)__label__1 can you clarify - do you have a time with timezone as input, and want time and different timezone as output? Or is the input time GMT ? __label__1 To be honest, I ' m not sure - the decision say "remove individuals and organizations" but it also said "per BLP" and Abascal is deceased. Perhaps you should ask Timrollpickering, the admin who closed the discussion, to clarify ? __label__1 sir.. can i still write an article? do you have any facebook account ? __label__1 If an object is cv::Mat, I can perform any linear algebraic, image processing, .. operations. What can I not do with it? :-)__label__1 What is this folder used for? I ' ve never heard of it before ? __label__1 What are you interested in achieving? Which other features would you like to see in the module ? __label__1 Hi, Leandrod - my computer is slow, and your last two edits were made on top of vandalism that needed to be reverted - I can ' t tell if I reverted legit changes by you or not? If I did, I ' m sorry, can you have a look ? __label__1 maybe.. this belongs on cstheory . stackexchange . com? not sure ? __label__1 Multiple editors never occurred to me - I didn ' t think much about the boxes, and the blocking help page wasn ' t of much use. Of "Block anonymous users only <url>, Prevent account creation <url>, Automatically block the last IP address used by this user, and any subsequent addresses they try to edit from <url>," which should I have checked ? __label__1 Thanks! :) So we ' re allowed to do multiple revdels at a time now ? __label__1 Sorry for the delay :/ When you say "overridden using filters," what do you mean exactly? There ' s an alternative to hacking on the source ? __label__1 To answer your last question, you want to use `extern "C"` to prevent the name - mangling. Not sure about the first one yet though; have you verified that you ' re actually being sent any messages ? __label__1 Nice, what did you set it to? greater or smaller ? __label__1 Unfortunately, i do not know how to start. Ok, I use fft, but what and how should I do next ? __label__1 On Linux, you pass the --disabled - password flag to adduser. Maybe OS X has something similar in its command line repertoire ? __label__1  " glug glug glug" sounds like no air behind water. Have you checked the vents on the roof ? __label__1 I have reverted your relocation of the images of this fragment - as I think it better if the images and transcripts can be seen side - by - side. Do you agree ? __label__1 How is your input given? Like in your examples or are you given a graph or something like that ? __label__1 I ' m having difficulty understanding your question. Could you please give a few more details, or explain what it is that isn ' t working for you ? __label__1 good idea. you have to chop them, right ? __label__1 Please clarify what you mean by 'sub - info'. Are you referring to the $info _ results array ? __label__1 Yes, that ' s fine, especially with the smaller sections. Where will they be posting their topic ideas ? __label__1 When creating <url>, I also had to create <url>, <url> and <url>. I was wondering if you could populate them ? __label__1 Will do that. As an aside (and please, I ' m sorry if I should not ask this here), is it possible to add code blocks in a comment ? __label__1 Maybe you should give an example of the array too? As I understand, you want to delete entries from an array, using only php no JS ? __label__1 Seems to work fine for me. What values are you passing to the method when it doesn ' t work ? __label__1 see if the `returnList . firstChild . textContent` is returning an array or not? By your statement can I assume that its working in FF and others ? __label__1 Are the Ajax or other porlet technologies good enough? Are there any other Java portlet technologies that I should study ? __label__1 How does an object type change dynamically? Do you have a vehicle base blass and two derived classes: car and bike ? __label__1 I remember having a similar problem. However, the link to the full code seems broken, could you update it ? __label__1 I think the inner div will resize, as it has a width of 100%, but you won ' t notice it. You probably want to resize the image, too ? __label__1 I have done a gridView with images that show a spinner and download image.. When download is complete, the image shows? Interested ? __label__1 A clarification: Do you want generalisations in the sense that feasible solutions are matchings, but your objective function is different from the usual max - weight matchings (something like the case of stable marriages)? Or generalisations in the sense that feasible solutions are also some kind of generalisations or relaxations of matchings (something like independent sets or fractional matchings)?__label__1 You appear to ask two different questions: are you building a language parser and wish to base your parser on a pile of regex? Or are you trying to implement a competitor to [pcre](http://ww . pcre . org/) or [Oniguruma](http://ww . geocities . jp / kosako3 / oniguruma / doc / RE . txt) regular expression parsers ? __label__1 I responded to your talk page comment, encouraging you to try your hand at reworking it. Good analysis of a potential problem, so why not take a whack at it ? __label__1 You may need to enable your own setting to allow E - mail too; I ' m not sure. If so, maybe you can turn it on temporarily, so that you can send me one e - mail ? __label__1 Got that ''Spin'' article in the post today; should prove helpful. Also, I ' ve added a Musical style section to the <url> article; any particular thoughts on what song would best exemplify the Dinosaur style ? __label__1  " Initrd requires at least one file system driver be compiled into the kernel".. I dint get much idea on this. Could you please explain this??__label__1 Aha, thanks, that makes some sense although can ' t flexible gas pipes be used if that ' s a concern ? __label__1 ok that was really confusing, I clicked on this link <url> and then cleaned the page but the page still exists, sso from what I understood if you put the ending "/double redirect" at the end of any article, you ' ll see how many redirects it has? is that right ? __label__1 I thing dev - tips like these should be tagged support, not discussion. (Maybe both?)__label__1 However could you please comment the difference? And the problem with the former ? __label__1 Hello <url>..I will eyeball it a bit and see what is going on with it, however, it appears this template is for a specific location in the U . S. (the D . C. area). Is this template going to be put into wider circulation once it is fixed and working ? __label__1 In <url>, you removed a cartoon image of Wendy Thomas that had been used in the infobox on her article. I ' m not very familiar with the NFCC policy you cite, so I was wondering if you thought that giving a rationale on the image for use in that particular article would bring it up to specs ? __label__1 Does it need to follow a specific pattern? Or is it fine if the characters from the input set appear potentially at any place ? __label__1 Is it acceptable to call it like `f2 ( func, *args, **kwargs)`, which in your case would be `f2 ( f1, 2, 2)`? Is this some kind of testing framework ? __label__1 What is the context that you think is lacking? any suggestions on what to add ? __label__1 Ok, many thanks for that. I ' m not sure how reliable that 2nd group are - it has <url> but what about all his dinner - guests ? __label__1 I was just reminded of my offer to generate a list of uncategorised templates, when I happened across your bot request again. Are you still interested in such a thing ? __label__1 The first example you give uses a relative url; the domain it ' s being served from should make no difference, because no domain is specified. Is each subdomain being mapped to a different site root ? __label__1 Back when the Nirvana article was a COTW (in like September I think) I started working out a "Musical style" section on a userpage, but never finished it. Would you like to help out with it ? __label__1 Do you think we ' re good to go with the proposal, maybe later tonight, or tomorrow? Any other problems with the proposal as it stands ? __label__1 Sure, I agree. But what ' s the good source you have in mind ? __label__1 I asked some questions in the Criteria for Inclusion section on 20th Dec but no - one has yet responded. Can you take a look ? __label__1 Hi, it looks like the en / em distinction is being preserved. What do you see as the advantage of changing the way they ' re currently written ? __label__1 I noticed your nice improvements to <url>. Are you thinking of merging / redirecting <url> to that article ? __label__1 In the description of the O ( n+m) method, do you mean "if J is _greater_ than the max, the target is not present", and compare just K, T in the max? Also, I may be missing something, but isn ' t `[ 100 200 ; 50 199 ]` a counter example, if the target is on the left of 100 ? __label__1 From my sources it seems that the Duke of York didn ' t have any radar when completed, but during her numerous refits different radar sets were added. So shall I list all the radar added from her refits ? __label__1 On the mediation page you made a number of statements that I said I would like to discuss with you. Would you be willing to do that <url>?__label__1 The character set in Oracle is 'WE8ISO8859P1' .. the eacute in my example is correctly stored in the database if I stay within Oracle .. but when I bring it into PHP via oci8, thats where the problem arises. Is there anything better than the charset _ decode _ utf _ 8 function ?__label__1 It sounds (no pun intended) like you are looking for some sort of shock sensor (accelerometer) to detect the impact of the kick. The problem that I see here is how do you limit the impact detection to just the kick event and not detect the impact of the foot / boot on the ground ? __label__1 I would say you went a few steps further than I did! Does make it easier to find yourself on the page, doesn ' t it ? __label__1 Actually, it worked locally but then did not work live on the site. On the site it is still saying "Access Denied" even if calling the jQuery file from the same domain / subdomain combination.. any thoughts ? __label__1 I have, and they have not responded in one week. How long should I give it ? __label__1 Same with the vandal over at <url>. I don ' t think enough people watch that page to get a consensus on protecting that page--what can be done in the meantime ? __label__1 I ' m not sure what you ' re asking. Can you explain what you mean by "cache `client`"?__label__1 I think, the point here is I should have checked for error when i am doing "ptr [ 0] = new char [ strlen ( psError) + 1];" This might be the reason that it is throwing error when i am trying to delete it later ? __label__1 I have developed a <url> showing the holders of the senior positions in the shadow cabinet since 1945. I thought that it might be of some use somewhere on English wiki, but it doesn ' t seem to fit with the current schemes for the <url> page, or the <url> page. Any ideas on where the table might go ? __label__1 You liked my edit? Are there any other climate pages in New Jersey that need help ? __label__1 That sounds amazing!! Can I have the link? :D__label__1 You better deal with it soon.. Some people need more relaxation than others or they will drop dead. *(Chest pains anyone?)*__label__1 Needs more context. Can you provide the question which precedes the answer too ? __label__1 Yes This is the correct answer. Can you please check if my proof below is correct ? __label__1 I do have one semi - newbie question: I made some edits under my IP before registering (<url>) and would like to "claim" them now that I have registered. Do you know if that ' s possible, and if so, how to go about it ? __label__1 I wish I could find a better one but I don ' t think I know where one is I think the composition needs more information. Can you do that ? __label__1 Have you tried running with breakpoints on? Have you tried enabling NSZombies ? __label__1 I don ' t understand what you are trying to ask me or suggest that I do. Can you clarify please ? __label__1 How did you import it into the project? "Add to build path.."?__label__1 What do you mean by MobileMail? The Mail app on the iPhone ? __label__1 If there are duplicate items in the trees, should the duplicates be merged or not? For example, if the trees are [1 , 2 , 3 , 4] and [1 , 2 , 5] should the result be [1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5] or [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5]?__label__1 Regarding your time setting, I ' m a little unsure what you want to do - there are only two things you can change - the timezone offset from GMT, which you set at the bottom of the screen by selecting the correct offset for your location from the list - I ' m guessing Asia / Calcutta would be about right, and the way the date / time is displayed, which you choose from the list of five options at the top of the screen. What problems are you having ?__label__1 On reflection it ' s up for GA peer review, preparatory to trying for FAC. Would you care to <url>?__label__1 BTW, I translated the page to the best of my ability (my Spanish only carried me so far). Do you speak Portuguese ? __label__1 The <url> has a request (header "<url>") left a few hours ago by someone who has pictures of signs in China but can ' t read them. Would you please be willing to help ? __label__1 Hi, nice article. What is meant by "speculative townhouses?" Ones that were built for prospective renters rather than for committed buyers ? __label__1 So, is the template too much? Should I add it to all articles contained within the template ? __label__1 @Derek Beattie I checked : ASP . NET and Silverlight are checked. Should I also check Enable Edit and Continue ?__label__1 It has been a pleasure working with you on the Burma campaign. What is your source for the Japanese information you have been adding as the books I have been reading on the subject are all from a British or American perspective ? __label__1 I noticed that you are the major contributor to the articles. Mind if I nominate <url> at <url>?__label__1 @jblue who said that hes not going to do any work himself. as you imply ? __label__1 Hi again, OK, say we don ' t go along the lines of Blair will go before the end of 2007; but we list the announced candidates for when Blair does resign (which will inevitably happen at some point). Do you think this would be any better / more suitable ? __label__1 could you describe the problems you are having? Are you logging the response codes ? __label__1 A agree with vsz. But if you want to apply this to dark car segmentation, what about negating the image and running the same approach ? __label__1 What operating environment are you in? Is this jQuery, WinForms, QT ? __label__1 Please define "better" Addresses are very, very difficult to make consistent. Do you have software to filter and standardize the addresses ? __label__1 Thanks. As an aside, since this did turn out to be factual, just very hard to source, do you think the community would countenance an unblock request from Blaabla if he accepted some strict unblock conditions (such as packing in the 'systemic bias' thing, discussing his edits in a less confrontational manner etc)?__label__1 Is your work email a Gmail account, or Exchange, etc? Which email app are you using ? __label__1 Is it necessary that you use a neural network to perform this classification? Or would other classes of algorithms be acceptable ? __label__1 Can you be more specific about how you want it to evaluate the logic? What should the code output ? __label__1 Dijkstra ' s algorithm finds the shortest path. Negating the weights would cause it to find the longest path, but that won ' t work if the graph contains cycles, right ? __label__1 Do the strings have the same lenght? Would padding all to the length of the longest one be a problem ? __label__1 What language is it? Can you provide a testcase demonstrating the behaviour ? __label__1 I wasn ' t sure what you mean by making the title a clickable link. Can you show me how to do that ? __label__1 Your question is phrased badly as it is both a double - negative and infers that we can read your mind. What you meant to say, I think, is, "Can you help me understand the meaning of this quote?"__label__1 Can you please provide all of the code between your $sql lines an when you actually query the DB? Are you calling `strip _ tags` on your sql statement ? __label__1 I am contemplating a larger article on this very interesting topic. Thoughts ? __label__1 Please can you add more information as to what you want "inner protected world" to mean? are we talking about a ring of planets, some sort of mental sanctum, or something interdimensional, or something completely other ? __label__1 Thank you for the links and the explanation. I ' d like to help with the project, what did you have in mind ? __label__1 I find it interesting claim that when using film, size gives any other advantage than resolution. If the emulsion is the same, how can it have more dynamic range ? __label__1 The plane of the X will always be parallel to the plane of the image I assume? So no perspective distortion of the X ? __label__1 Have you checked the newest GCC (gcc4) version to make sure it isn ' t done already? Have you mentioned your intentions on any (gcc) relevant forum ? __label__1 I ' m a StatEt user, but I ' m not aware of a debugger built into Statet. Do you mean the debugging tools built into core R or some other aspect ?__label__1 I ' m actually still stucked.. Even if I specify a file to Vim in my program (using the backticks), it stills going to start in a subshell. Is there a way to start vim in the current user shell ? __label__1 @Max: Good point, although you misspelled my name. How do you know that 1UU0 is the only one that ' s impossible ? __label__1 BTW, I see you ' ve left some comments at <url>. Would you be interested in signing on to the project ? __label__1 @ime Vidas JSLint is mostly telling me that I am calling functions before they are defined.

Could you have a look at it, and try to improve it ? __label__1 Hi DeltaQuad, Since several reviews have been done, can you review the version from the same date? 1 July 2010 ? __label__1 Hi, I wsa just noticing that in <url>, players such as Tommy Walsh and Paul O ' Connor have appeared under 'T' and 'P' respectively, rather than 'W' and 'O'. How should that be fixed ? __label__1 Certainly the work is out of copyright, and some of the neighboring volumes in the series are visible on archive . org (and I don ' t have trouble with other books on google generally). I wonder if you know of any way, or could suggest any way, that I could get to see the downloaded pdf of Newcomb vol . 6 ? __label__1 Sorry, I ' ve moved a number of articles and thought I did it correctly. How is moving done properly without losing the edit history ? __label__1 Thank you for that, I was having a problem with diffs and the explanation didn ' t make sense to me. This is the first I have had to do, what is the procedure ? __label__1 Depends on your OS. Are you on Linux, Mac, Windows ? __label__1 How do you pass the design into jasper? Is it doable to have two designs depending on the option selected ? __label__1 Does each '?' have to be substituted with the same letter, or can they be different ? __label__1 @tjameson Ok, If I keep the `{10}` I should be able to ditch the `length != 10` right? or is it better not to ? __label__1 How much Perl code do you have? (files, total sloc)?__label__1 Where do you suggest that I post the citation? In the "USNA" section or the "Hispanic alumni section"?__label__1 He ' s stumped about what the block is for, and so am I. Could you clarify ? __label__1 What have you tried so far? Is this homework ? __label__1 @dmckee - I wasn ' t aware that a closed question could be edited. Will an edited closed question generally get reconsideration ? __label__1 Maybe the area that is now the Chakma Autonomous District Council was (or is?) located within the Lawngtali district ? __label__1 This would make a great addition to DYK, you know. (<url> :) It ' s just under a thousand wordsu2014maybe more of your thesis would like to make it onto WP ? __label__1 Would I be right to understand that, since you ' ve posted this on SO, you are looking for a programming way to solve this question ? Something like a rewrite system for propositions in Bayesian probabilities ?__label__1 Are you looking for a provider that accepts ZAR *as well* or would one accepting ZAR *only* be sufficient? Would you be able / willing to hold / use a merchant bank account with a South African bank for this purpose ? __label__1 That works just fine when I try it. What error are you getting ? __label__1 Are the x / y coordinates actually reals or integers? That is, can you determine a neighbor by finding the tile with x=x+1 & y=y ? __label__1 This is something i can explore. Could you please send me an example? thx__label__1 @Altermundus Sorry, I dont see how it would work and my experiments haven ' t been successfull. Could you give a little more details, please ?__label__1 Hi @Schisis, thanks for this link! Can you please add a bit more info to the answer, explaining what the link is ? __label__1 Hi there. On a tangential note, would you happen to be <person>?__label__1 Wow, that thing looks awesome! Is it quick / easy to attach ? __label__1 Hi there, it looks like the moving editor has added a bunch of references to the talk page supporting the fact Toto is no longer formally referred to as Moorland Totilas. Do you think if we added one or more of the refs he ' s added on the talk page to the article we could move it back ? __label__1 Posters are assuming you live in North America. Is this a valid assumption ? __label__1 I should be able to get that Mayr paper, it ' s on Wiley. Do you need me to email it to you ? __label__1 So resizing of an image can be only done proportionally, right? I can ' t resize an 8x10 to 8x8 without cropping ? __label__1 Why the hell was this migrated from SO? What made them think it belonged here ? __label__1 Not to worry. What ' s "D . M."?__label__1 @Colin Fine: I think it ' s a good example, especially for the use case described. Could you please add your comment as an answer ? __label__1 Does the application run ok locally when you ' re not trying to debug? Do any other web apps allow you to debug ? __label__1 Hello?

Is that better ? __label__1 also, did you read through the documentation of add _ meta _ box at http://codex . wordpress . org / Function _ Reference / add _ meta _ box ?__label__1 Slightly more seriously, there ' s a discussion over at <url> about the lack of non - European info regards torture. Any chance that in your manifold research on all things psychohistorical you ' ve found something that could be used to expand the section ? __label__1 The early life and early carreer can be incorporated into the article, I believe. Did you want to finish the whole CAA article rewrite first or put part of the rewrite into the article ? __label__1 @freiheit: Thanks for the answer. Where can I get these items? Can I get some of them combined (whichever I want to have) or do I have to buy separately each of what I need ? __label__1 Hi, what was the image you are having problems with? Was it <url>?__label__1 Hmm..the picture was taken on my camera by someone else. To whom does the copyright belong ? __label__1 Thanks.

Please see the screenshots of it and my /etc / fstab, any other ideas ? __label__1 At first I couldn ' t see it, but now that I ' ve taken a closer look I see what you mean. Now, I wonder, who was the first most decorated PR soldier in WW II ? __label__1 A little bit more detail would be ideal to get the question. At least, how does your data look like, who are the subscribers, what do they have to do with average time, and how is 'average time in service' defined ? __label__1 Yes, I agree. Would you please make the appropriate change ? __label__1 Regarding comment on "length of Performance reviews" section - the intention here is to provide support for the statement in the biography that "Latsabidze is already regarded by many as one of the more significant performers of his generation". Do you recommend that I just delete this statement, or is there some other way to support it other than providing representative critical reviews that say so ? __label__1 Doing it under the guidance of the relevant <url> would be a good idea as the folks that are active in the project will be best placed to advise on which templates and styles fit in with the rest of the project. What is the page / subject you are working on ? __label__1 Thanks. As for the previous edits, should I make a note on the User Page that it ' s my account ? __label__1 Clever work with the search and replace (I still think w : es should have recognised that ISO date format, tho'). Now, any idea where I can find a list of the DF ' s late, unlamented ''regentes'' to flesh out my <url> article ? __label__1 Should be a community wiki question then? There isn ' t a right answer, I believe ? __label__1 Thanks! Example of using breqn in my case please ? __label__1 yes that should be possible. I ' d have to build some UI based on some javascript library and then some custom php integration to save the preferences in drupal database then ? __label__1 I have an interesting proposal.. assuming the common tail of the list is infinitely long. How can you find the node intersection using constant memory ? __label__1 Great! Do you use IRC at all, or do you stay on - wiki ? __label__1 I was doing some minor editing on this, and noticed that the date of death in the intro and infobox don ' t match. Could you take a look at this and see which is correct ? __label__1 @user12739 Give us more information please. What problem are you having exactly ? __label__1 I just saw that after I left this message to you. By speech marks do you mean quotation marks ? __label__1 Do the repeats have to be contiguous? is 5 , 1 , 4 , 1 allowed if R=2 ?__label__1 This might be a Facebook issue, but it might also be an issue with how your code is prepping the image to be sent. Can you share your code that reads the image (form your server) and calls the Facebook SDK ? __label__1 What FTP software are you use? What authentication methods ? __label__1 I tried to address your concerns in the nomination page. Do you mind having another look ? __label__1 I haven ' t used photoshop in ages, but that seems quite large. Do you mean the size of the files on disk, or do you mean the memory footprint of the file when you ' re working with it ? __label__1 Are you working on D2009 or later, i . e. are you working with string=ansistring or with unicode strings ? __label__1 As someone who has edited <url> you might be interested to see that it has been suggested for deletion (or some other form of bastardization). Care to join in the discussion ? __label__1 Sorry to be a pain, but where did you go to get that screenshot? Views | Select the View | Displays | Filter Criteria | and then ? __label__1 Any wisdom as to how to get the vinegar to not smell ? __label__1 In the ACR for <url>, you mentioned that you had concerns with my writing style and were wary of supporting it. Can you specifically clarify what content in the article you had grammatical concerns with so I can make the needed improvements and gain your support ? __label__1 For those times when the understanding gained comes to use. Since this question came up - do we have figures on which is faster and by *how much* ?__label__1 so you saying that Facebook is a small company? with 5 billion dollar in value ? __label__1 Thanks for reverting <url> - that was actually me, unlogged in. OK if I re - revert ? __label__1 Hello. Do you know if / how coat of arms from councils abolished in 2009 can be licensed ? __label__1 I take it you only have to have pieces at the corners of the square to win, and you can ' t move on a space where your opponent has already moved? Does the square have to be aligned with the axes, or does a square tilted 45 degrees win the game ? __label__1 i get this as well, is it only happening since you moved to a later version of xCode? is your configuration in Debug ? __label__1 I see this page is indefinitely semi - protected. It ' s been over eighteen months: mind if I give unprotecting it a try ? __label__1 I think he is talking about the variable length arrays that were added to C in the C99 revision of the language. Is that correct aa ? __label__1 The benefit of a version of the sentence is that it helps clarify the differences between Lavoisier and Priestley; however, we need to be careful that we don ' t convey the wrong impression to the reader. How best to do this ? __label__1 That is why I suggest the following: either we refer to him as u201cSouth - Netherlandishu201d (like he is described on the Dutch Wikipedia page) or we omit the nationality completely and we just mention the cities he lived in. Does this seem acceptable ? __label__1 Do you require the actual return code from file . sh? Can you change the script so that it writes to a file when complete ? __label__1 This has been tagged Civ - 4, that seems to be the wrong game. Was a different tag intended ? __label__1 What kind of system did you develop the script on (and the make - file)? Did the actual files come from a Windows system originally ? __label__1 That ' s four times the capacity of the one you posted a link to, and would be almust five pounds of water on your back. Best of luck finding one, but maybe you should focus on one that ' s easy to refill instead ? __label__1 Sorry, just realized you were talking specifically about using the word in the title, which does make things a little trickier-- you probably don ' t want your app to have a different name on both sides of the pond, although it wouldn ' t be unheard of. Can ' t you just use "Plane" instead? :P__label__1 What environment are you developing under? OS X, Linux or Windows ? __label__1 I ' ve been meaning to add soundclips to the Suede and Stone Roses articles (3u20134 for each). I can get to it over the weekend; suggestions ? __label__1 I like your question. Can you tell us where you plan to post the results ? __label__1 Sounds like a framework bug. Could you upload a minimal .xcproj so I can see what ' s going on ? __label__1 I added two. Happy? ;-)__label__1 Hi! Could you consider speedy deleting <url>?__label__1 Could you precise your idea please ? Which expression of weights should I consider ?__label__1 What ' s the deal here? Question asked and answered by the same person, who ' s profile is mysteriously not linked any more ? __label__1 I do not know how to merge them. Are you familiar with the process ? __label__1 I do not know what you mean by "important links" as you mentioned on my talk page. Will you please clarify ? __label__1 I ' d be curious to know how your activity timestamps could come in out - of - order for a given user session. Would it realistically report 13 : 00, 14 : 00, 13 : 30 for a given user ? __label__1 do you do dfs from every node? if not, what nodes do you begin the search from ? __label__1 Hey, you seem to know a bit about coding, so I figured you might have an answer here. If I want use code to grab the target of a page known to be a redirect, how would I do that ? __label__1 Yes, it is a matter of civility. Do you think a year would be better ? __label__1 I ' ve never heard of this happening. Is this one of the core widgets ? __label__1 how far off of their true locations are the points? meters, or not even in the right general area ? __label__1 Im also looking for an answear to this one. Is there any possibility with nhibernate to extend an entity from within another map without touching the "main"-map ?__label__1 Also, in accordance with <url>, I think the Turkish Army Corps should be 3rd Corps, 4th Corps, 5th Corps, not II Corps, IV Corps, V Corps. What do you think ? __label__1 Thanks! By the way, have you sent anything to Maggie since you received the email from the photographer ? __label__1 Can you look at this page <url> and tell me what you think. It has the vandal picture but wasn ' t edited today ? __label__1 Hi Pete- The user "Darmi" on <url> says that footnotes are used on Wikisource, and he has two pages to show for it. What do you think ? __label__1 Your problem is not fully specified - when there is a blob you wish to identify, may there be other filed cells on the board separate from the blob? Also you talk about "similarity" - but are you after a precise pattern match or an approximate one ? __label__1 Community wiki? (Also: sigoldberg1, can we have a link?)__label__1 What defines the end of an entry? Is it guaranteed that the lines within an entry won ' t start with a digit, but a line defining a new entry will ? __label__1 I don ' t think it matters for the algorithm, but for the record: do you want floating - point accuracy, or are integer coordinates sufficient? If so, how should they be rounded ? __label__1 I seem to have stuffed up creating 4 April 2009 very badly. Can you help ? __label__1 Computer Science classes, always fun times. Have you identified the errors above ?__label__1 are the line segments only straight lines? Do you want an algorithm that given two polygons finds what line segments they 'overlap' over ? __label__1 Don ' t worry about it. Take it easy, keep the ranting to a minimum and the productive editing to a maximum :) And you ' re still not convinced you should get an account ? __label__1 I don ' t see any inherent problem with what you have done above, and it looks like no one else sees anything, either; can you post more code? How certain are you that the setfault happens at that particular waitall ? __label__1 What is your photo Column defined as? can you provide the table create stmt ? __label__1 In addition to reformatting, can you try to provide some more info? Where are you stuck, what ' s going wrong ? __label__1 I actually went to the long term abuse page right now, and tried to block them, but it seems that those accounts don ' t exist. Have they been listed incorrectly ? __label__1 So what do you need help with ? Where are you stuck ?__label__1 IB can be a pain with UITableView sizing. Have you considered doing this programmatically, initializing the tableView with a style and then setting the frame to a specified frame with CGRectMake ( x , y , w , h)?__label__1 Any thoughts on what we should do with this? Delete it as a duplicate, or copy to Commons and rename ? __label__1 @Kdoto- I think it is, since I think I came up with one possible implementation. :-) Can you check and see if my logic is correct ? __label__1 +1 for not saying "hey, I ' ll just rent a VPS! I won ' t get hacked because I ' ve got automatic updates, right?"__label__1 From my reading of the entries, the Japanese force in <url>/South <url> & the <url> appears to have been the <url>, rather than the <url>. Does that sound right ? __label__1 There ' s been a slow revert war occurring between <url> and <url> over the Katja Kassin article and I ' ve just left a strongly worded suggestion that they hash out their differences in the article ' s talk page. Could you keep an eye on the article for a day or two, just to make sure they stop reverting and start discussing ? __label__1 Please elaborate on what you mean by "calling directly" and "from another class". Which object is making this call in the first case ? __label__1 The README file provided with the samples seems to give all the information you might need. What precisely do you not understand ? __label__1 Sorry, I thought I had. It ' s a simple game, "Guess My Number - The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100> The player tries to guess it and the computer lets the player know if the guess is too high, too low or right on the money" Forgive me, I ' m new here, should I have explained further ? __label__1 Replace the 100px with the size you ' re looking for. Did this help ? __label__1 Thanks for your participation. Just out of curiosity, is a site preference for color over black and white explicitly indicated on some guideine or policy page ? __label__1 Sorry, but I fail to see any correspondence between the title and the actual question in the body. Could you consider rewriting the title to be more precise ? __label__1 Thanks for the heads up. What damage did they do ? __label__1 For what country? Could the data from openstreetmap be complete enough for your locality ? __label__1 I have never seen anything which says that warning levels should begin anew each day. <url> says that warning templates "are listed at right in order of severity, but need not be used in succession." If there is another policy somewhere, could you show it to me ? __label__1 It may very well have been a better candidate for a stub rather than a speedy deletion. I would rather not talk about this on another users talk page, if you would like to discuss if further could we continue any further posts on <url>?__label__1 So, you essentially want to fetch most frequent words from the text. Is that correct ? __label__1 Did you read the page linked to from that one? If so, which / what part ( s) didn ' t you understand ? __label__1 It looks like its not processing the imports in the WSDL. Have you confirmed suds works with external imports ? __label__1 I don ' t know which of the answers I should select as the "accepted answer" as each one answers a part of my question. What is the normal procedure here ? __label__1 A platform for new developers to show off their stuff? Having your app hosted on a solid cloud service ? __label__1 @Aaronut Hi. Private message ? __label__1 The reason for the malfunctioning redirects is that the character immediately after "REDIRECT" is not an ordinary space, but a "non - breaking space", hex code 0xA0. Out of curiosity: how did you manage to create them ? __label__1 In what way does it fail? i . e. what happens differently in your program between the first method and the second one ? __label__1 You recently attached a <nowiki><person></nowiki> tag to an article about an Azeri poet. May I ask why ? __label__1 To clarify: Are you using the same connection object to perform all the queries in your application? What specific connection class are you using ? __label__1 It appears that you deleted my comments and vote on <url>. May I ask why ? __label__1 It depends on the hash function. What hash functions are you thinking of ? __label__1 This question isn ' t really on topic, in my view. It also might induce a holy war, along the lines of "vi or emacs?"__label__1 Yeah, and it will still have been the third to pass the full bit string tests, instead of just the byte tests. :) What ' s the significance of 2042 ? __label__1 Also, I think it might not happen with all applications. Can you please use Banshee as the app we ' re testing with ? __label__1 This has since been part of the site. Is it still useful ? __label__1 Ok, thanks for that. Could you please tell me why the Kiwa page is giving warning about notability and citations, where as for example this one <url> is not ? __label__1 Damn it i didn ' t notice that thank you. Is there another way to get the RGB value of individual pixels in android ? __label__1 If this question isn ' t being moved to meta, can it be split? Move the stuff specifically related to this site to meta, and leave the rest here for general web use ? __label__1 Right now I am doing something like http://pastie . org / 898437. Is there some other better way to do the same ? __label__1 thanks - that ' s what I feared, but it ' s good to hear that you found it workable. If this site is available, can you please let me know the URL ? __label__1 It was nominated for speedy deletion because he wasn ' t notable. However, if I undelete the page, will you improve the article and be able to provide decent sources to help his notability ? __label__1 What swaps would be required to get your original list to its reordered state? Is that number of swaps proportional to the 100 swaps out of "several hundred to a thousand" original lines of data ? __label__1 Great question, I ' m really curious about that also. Any mechanical engineer types out there got a good explanation ? __label__1 Can you give a little more context? What library contains this line of code ? __label__1 I ' ve now supplied a free image on <url> (thanks for motivating me to do so!). Could you perhaps consider your reassessment of the article ? __label__1 I posted here rather than to Jon ' s page because I don ' t want to embarrass the students; I know Jon watchlists your page and I am sure other NRG editors do too. Anyway, what do you think ? __label__1 What R package did you use for HC3 estimation? `sandwich`, `contrast`?__label__1 Please edit your question and explain what isn ' t working. What errors are you seeing, or how isn ' t it working as you expect ? __label__1 While it is possible to weld frames together - witness [this tall - bike frame](http://ww . flickr . com / photos / neilfein / 4653212878 / in / set - 72157624042376181) - I ' m going to guess that the stresses on a tandem would require some rather heavy reinforcement, making for an extremely heavy tandem frame. Can someone confirm or deny this ? __label__1 A query walks into a bar, up to two tables and says, 'Can I join you?'. Are homework questions allowed ? __label__1 Also: Do you realize that variables created in class scope (in your code, every assignment above `#--..`) are *class variables*, i . e. shared among instances, and not instance variables (`self..`)?__label__1 Thanks for the reply. Could you please elloborate on "long as you keep the dependencies clean (no cycles) and you already know where to cut to divide " prob with an example ? __label__1 I have to say that I don ' t like the output, harder to read and code isn ' t formatted with the correct colors. Could there be an optional output for how it is printed ? __label__1 Are you sure it ' s WordPress autocomplete? Do you get a different result with a different browser ? __label__1 Assuming for the moment that it ' s NOT a bug, it does make me think we could 'reverse engineer' the purposes of the different colors by shooting some test shots. What happens if you manually select a focus point, for example ? __label__1 Thanks a lot! Can you please comment on [this](http://wordpress . stackexchange . com / questions / 23990 / initialize - wordpress - environment - to - use - in - a - real - cron - script) related question ? __label__1  " I ' m not sure what the most efficient way of doing this is." Try both and see which one is faster ? __label__1 I could go on from here, but this is essentially the underlying basis of my reasoning. Does this help explain my position ? __label__1 Many languages can do this in their standar libraries. Any prefered language or do you want a "pure" algorithm ? __label__1 seems fine in Chrome. How exactly does one reproduce the problem ? __label__1 Right. Any idea where I plug in the OAuth2 stuff ? __label__1 @Curtismchale - To clarify, I think this question has two parts, one asking for an inexpensive heart - rate monitor, the the other asking about wrist - vs - chest mount units. @David, is this correct ? __label__1 Hello, picxelplay; welcome on _Drupal Answers_. Did you try changing the theme used by the website ? __label__1 Started, shall we post on the <url> page and ask for others to collaborate. Is that a good use of the WikiProject ? __label__1 Yeah, I saw the French logo on the top of the page.. I couldn ' t find any better versions of that logo, but the English one should suffice, right ? __label__1 I don ' t play club anymore (I stopped this year), I have just been too busy this year, but I will probably start again soon - ish. Where abouts do you play ? __label__1 I don ' t recall any consensus on that unilateral change. Can you direct me to it, please ? __label__1 Can you give examples for _positive_ and _negative_ articles, please? Isn ' t that subjective ? __label__1 We were actually also interested in this idea. Can you give a little more detail as to how you do this? When do you add the water? How much water ? __label__1 does the fading stay constant? Or do you also want to change how lighter or darker the top gets??__label__1 Isn ' t this too time localized anyway? How long will "at the moment" last ? __label__1 My graphics editing skills aren ' t up to the creation of a map such as this from scratch, but I could probably do an adequate job of removing the red and orange lines and the related entries in the map legend. Would it be useful for me to take a whack at that ? __label__1 Which part are you having trouble with? Do you need help determining if there are new items, or do you need to know how to start an executable once you ' ve determined that there are new items ? __label__1 For the record, there are about a bazillion "big gears" in Limbo. Next time include a screenshot perhaps ? __label__1 Well the only plausible explanation was that you reverted to where I removed an extraneous cat (after Homestarmy ' s edit) and then swapped out a template.. but as you ' re a competent editor that just seemed odd. Is that what indeed occurred ? __label__1 There ' s a lot of unfilled requests to become a verified user at WP : OP. Could you possibly look through them ? __label__1 That ' s a big topic. Is there something specific you ' re having trouble with, or do you need ideas of where to start ? __label__1 I found this talk page (and <url>) while deleting the user pages that you requested. Would you like to have them deleted as well ? __label__1 I agree. How about using Mizbot ? __label__1 Hi. Is there anything I can do to help you utilize the spell check features of your browser ? __label__1 Sounds like it was trying to go down the stack, but found itself going up instead. I ' m not sure how that might have happenedstack smashed ? __label__1 Hi Mic, you changed <url> with a comment of "Conforming to header format". Where can I get the standard header format ?__label__1 i made a mistake on adding a colon on <url> and it can ' t be reverted. Could you help ? __label__1 are you on a linux / unix machine, maybe using cygwin? then have you tried the "file" command on a file ? __label__1 Good day, sorry to bother you. Is the 2 : 00 am news brief called eyewitness news everynite, and if it is do they play move closer to your world ? __label__1 The PressTV references in Wikipedia ' s "Turkey - PKK Conflict" article are not the same, but the titles are wrong. If you have time, can you correct the titles ? __label__1 I ' m hesitant to deal the final blow to this question to be honest. If dealing with CSS isn ' t a part of webmastering, then what is ? __label__1 No worries. So back to my question: what software makes them rock like that ? __label__1 Could you post the code? Have you tried other Rubies (using RVM)?__label__1 I haven ' t used those features much yet; can you explain what effect you ' d like them to have on your blog? Should ignored tags make it so the user never even sees those posts, does it just affect the tag cloud, or something else ? __label__1 Merci. Now do you have any idea to solve discrepancy in <url> ?__label__1 What do you mean by "like this"? And for what exactly are you asking a rationale ? __label__1 I tried a if (ajaxBanner _ timeout == 0) {.. but that didn ' t work. Where do I need to define ajaxBanner _ timeout ? __label__1 Good find. Do you have a cite for the second para ? __label__1 Thanks. Do you feel the information is "weak" or is it just too complex ? __label__1 OK you ' re right- I guess IPs can ' t do it. I believe they ' re all fixed now, right ? __label__1 It ' s not clear what you ' re trying to do here. Do you want the view to render the string "1 image more than 1 image .. "?__label__1 <person> - sorry about that, those situations are confusing. Maybe Twinkle uses, or behaves like, rollback ? __label__1 This is the first time I ' ve heard of this. What is it ? __label__1 Can you describe how it crashes? Do you get any kind of error message or exception ? __label__1 Could I now rewrite the current <url> article to be primarily about the comic, with a small section mentioning that a future film has been announced? Or should I wait until the deletion debate is over and then (if neccessary) create a new <url> article like that ? __label__1 I ' m happy to help! After all, what ' s the point of acquiring knowledge about a process if I don ' t use that knowledge to help others ? __label__1 I can ' t reproduce this. You have selected `Taxonomy: Term` and not `Taxonomy: Term ID` in the Sort Criteria box ? __label__1 I think that the standards should not apply to animated pictures like ''Tintin'' where start of production is a fuzzy limit. After all, do we have proof that the production of ''<url>'' or ''<url>'' is more advanced than the one of ''Tintin'' ?__label__1 I object to the use of cats in the described manner. Can we change it to dogs ? __label__1 Well, that didn ' t take long. The Mac App Store was released, what, less than two hours ago ? __label__1 What are you having a problem with? Are you having trouble with the ssh authentication ? __label__1 Wow, thanks for pointing that out. I ' m having a bad night, and all the theading.. anyway, did I get them all ? __label__1 Could you clarify what you mean by "zoom?" Are you referring to the effects of `Ctrl +` and `Ctrl -`?__label__1 I know this is a bit outside your usual territory but I wonder if you would be interested in helping us get <url> to FA status in time for the 50th anniversary of the line ' s closure on 10 June 2011? A question has also arisen in connection with the proper referencing of a journal article using the sfn template: when quoting a journal article - say from January 2010 - should the correct formulation be <nowiki><person></nowiki> or should the month be dropped ? __label__1 Thanks for responding, at any rate. <smile> Protocol question, as I ' m new here: If a discussion is unproductive, should one just delete it ? __label__1 I see you ended the AfD on <url> and removed the tag. Will you remove it on the other two articles that were proposed along with it, <url> and <url>?__label__1 I agree with Orlady here; full - protection, a fairly serious position when we ' re talking about an encyclopedia anyone can edit, is only to be taken out as a last (reasonable) resort. Since both participants to the dispute are now blocked, is there any reason for the protection to be necessary ? __label__1 I recommend the [$0 . 5M 1THz Agilent VNA](http://cp . literature . agilent . com / litweb / pdf / 5989 - 7620EN . pdf). £1~$1070, right? :D__label__1 Problem is how do you recognise the categories, as there are thousands of them. I have already made a program that scans the database, and can locate the unstubbed articles, so finding the untagged stubs is ok, and AWB automatically adds the stub tag if the article is short, I just can ' t think how you could program it to automatically guess the type of stub, any ideas ? __label__1 Hey Kumioko! I have a quick question - do you do photo requests in NOVA and / or DC ? __label__1 Please explain why you think the `ClassNotFoundException` is incorrect. Possibly even share some code ? __label__1 I would be concerned more with the layout of your data and how you ' re accessing them. Could you paste a sample of 10 rows, and the most common queries you ' re using ? __label__1 Let ' s talk about the error in a little bit more detail, Sergey. What is the output you get and what is the output you expect ? __label__1 Sorry for the late reply, but I usually check new additions from the bottom of the page, not the top. What is your disappointment regarding ? __label__1 Hi again! Have you had a chance to get it lately ? __label__1 This is a great way to deal with external links. Wondering if we should look at applying it almost universally for medical pages ? __label__1 Okay, perhaps we need to initiate a task force to go and address issues on these lists. I ' m happy to participate or rubber - stamp.. What do you think ? __label__1 A quick search finds this code. http://staff . washington . edu / dushaw / GPS / gettracks . awk Is that checksum function what you are looking for ? __label__1 what are you trying to do with the ticket itself? Is it an option to generate tickets as needed using keytabs ? __label__1 Per <url> we should summarize the article briefly in the lede. I didn ' t see anything about higher dimensions in the <url> body so should it be removed from the lede or should the body be expanded ? __label__1 Hello. Can you help me create a map of Isabela which reflects the 3D map ? __label__1 What environment are you running the code on? Could you enclose the code as it would make it easier to help you for us SO ' ers ? __label__1 Should the solution report duplicates that are in different folders, or only duplicates in the same folder. E . g. would `/bert / me . gif` not be considered a duplicate of `/ernie / me . gif` (assuming identical file size)?__label__1 Please specify the platform you are compiling on, and also specify the command line options to the compiler that you ' re using. Is `-std=c99` one of the options, for example ? __label__1 Can you clarify a bit? You mean a type that implements `IEnumerable(<T>)`, or like an `enum` with a set number of values ? __label__1 Altering the top - level structure, moving elements between top level arrays? How does your sort need to function in the higher dimension ? __label__1 Is your column `OLE Object` type? Do you use `Bound Object Frame` control to display the images ? __label__1 What E - Mail library are you using? Can you show the full code ? __label__1 What are you looking to aggregate? Total sales value, number of orders by customer, total deposit, total number of items sold ? __label__1 I see you deleted the Shayla LaVeaux article, citing copyright problems. I ' d like to see if I can ' t clean it up.. is there any way I can see the deleted article ? __label__1 Indeed, this is more applied mathematics than physics, though I ' m not sure it ' s a good enough reason to close this question. It ' s an odd question in any case; perhaps a little clarification would help? :)__label__1 Good shot of Danica ' s car qualifying at Japan. Were you able to see her win the race ? __label__1 Yep, she told me. How are you doing ? __label__1 Is it a bluetooth keyboard? And does this Apple link http://support . apple . com / kb / TA23441 ? viewlocale=en _ US by chance help at all ? __label__1 I found an obscure reference to idna trace. Has anyone heard of / used this application ? __label__1 Did you run any individual tests? If so, how ? __label__1 Is it possible that it could be a passenger issue? Does devise / warden cache the current _ user variable ? __label__1 @alexanderpas What servers? No servers are being mentioned ? __label__1 Thanks for the poking tip! How long to cook ? __label__1 Do you need to read all of the files in the directory? Or, more specifically, are there files in that directory that you do not want to read ? __label__1 Can you please provide a simple sample Haml file and the output you want to get? Do you want Ruby `- foo` and `= foo` blocks to turn into Erb `<% foo %>` and `<%= foo %>` (respectively), or something else ? __label__1 Hi, I ' ve added a question to your RfA. Also, could you elaborate on how you will ''prevent'' vandalism ? __label__1 @DADU What changes do you want to make on that HTML string? Can you give some examples ? __label__1 Apologies if I am mistaken, but this reads like a homework question. Is it ? __label__1 Ok, so this is the answer I have come up with after reading all the posts on here: "This statement will return true because $var is being assigned a value of donut, and assignment occurs before the statement is evaluated and therefore would be boolean true because it has a value." Is this correct ? __label__1 Hi Leonard G., I just read through your RFA including your reform proposals. Could you take a look at <url>, a proposal I have developed which would give just the rollback tool to people who request it ? __label__1 Kaiser , Thanks for your help . I have updated the question with links to the pages which show error messages. Can you please login and check it by yourself if I give you the admin access to website ? __label__1 @carson I ' m one of your user :).

How much water will flow out when the ice cube melts ? __label__1 Where does the menu show up on the page? Do you have HTML or (better yet) a [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle . net/) that we can look at ? __label__1 Thanks. The wall is 10 1 / 2 feet wide. Also, how much excess carpet should I leave in order to have enough to tuck it between the tack strip and baseboard ? __label__1 It ' s kind of hard to understand what you are asking. Maybe you could clarify it a little bit ? __label__1 I don ' t own any from Rousseau either, but I did know it was Grand Cru, just made a mistake! I notice above you and Stefan discussing the Langton ' s Classification Wines, I ' m going to have a go at getting articles made for more of the exceptional level producers, I ' ve just finished one on <url> - are you interested in working on any of them together ? __label__1 I ' m strongly considering closing this as a duplicate of [Taking it to the next level](http://cooking . stackexchange . com / q / 10317 / 41) which was itself a duplicate of [Books that explain the science of cooking?](http://cooking . stackexchange . com / q / 9657 / 41). Anyone have any comments on what distinguishes this one from the others ? __label__1 I believe that would be different on different hardware. What architecture ? __label__1 Just to clarify: Do you want your program to be notified of mouse click events so that it can act upon them, or do you want to inject mouse click events into the windowing system? And what platform are you on (mac/*nix / Windows / etc)?__label__1 Sorry, I ' ve moved a number of articles and thought I did it correctly. How is moving done properly without losing the edit history ? __label__1 What kind of error message do you get?

I said that I would gladly help out if it was ok with you ? __label__1 do they have to be executables? what about MEF and doing the apps as plugins for the "launcher"?__label__1 I know, but your question implied that you have conductive tape and want to know if it is conductive. Another good question might be, Is there a conductive tape product and then have details in the question about what you need specifically ? __label__1 Do you mind also explaining why bikes have this feature ? __label__1 Thanks. Are you Slashdot user Anothy by any chance, or someone else ? __label__1 If you view the image by itself in a new tab / window. What dimension does the image turn out to be ? __label__1 Do you have tabbed browsing enabled?..

Is there a timeline expert that can come in a fix it if we recommend that action be taken ? __label__1 Please rephrase your question with an example of the data and the code. Where is the datastructure you ' re trying to scan ? __label__1 Has it crashed before? How often does it crash ? __label__1 i noticed you changed <url> to <url>. do you think the same should be done for <url>?__label__1 How sparse is the matrix? Does the matrix have any special shape, or relationship between entries ? __label__1 sorry, i ' m not able to comprehend that? Where is the "add folder" option in the places menu ? __label__1 I thought that I should tell you that I created a new SVG version of the Wikipedia logo, located <url>. It has a few problems, could you help me with it ? __label__1 Hello..I looked up <url>, and found that this person is a previous vandal. Is this sufficient to block the user, since more vandalism was done on Cold War article ? __label__1 Hi SKS, I saw your post on the discussion on the charts page about Billboard Korea and I clicked the link and the website seems to be up and running but I can ' t make sense of it.

Any reasonable explanation to why??__label__1 Confused. Could you give a short example with an uncompressed input and the compressed output your algorithm produces ? __label__1 Also note that I know this question has been asked before and the general consensus was to avoid rebuilding your code if you didn ' t need to, then you don ' t have to deal with the changed assemblies, which apparently is a part of the deal. May I ask why you need to rebuilds to be identical, as opposed to just not rebuilding it if the code hasn ' t changed ? __label__1 Another idea, looks like you are using `MBProgressHUD`, I guess your code is triggered from an animation callback, from memory, I think CoreData is not multi - threading safe. Try not to do this from `MBProgressHUD` or try using `performSelectorOnMainThread` maybe ? __label__1 What happens when you run this under debugging, and what ' s your configuration? Can you show me the first part of the packages file it creates ? __label__1 Not really following what you need, are you looking for something like: http://drupal . org / project / hierarchical _ select ? __label__1 Re your e - mail, there is info there which is not on my talk page.

Anyway, are you trying to get a second machine to process the data for redundancy or for more throughput ? __label__1 Thanks, really useful. But is the foam strictly necessary? What are the disadvantages of not using this ? __label__1 Hi, I see that you added the etymology section of the <url> article. What does "RatCE" mean ? __label__1 Since you are the main contributor to <url>, I figured I should let you know what I would like to do to it. Would you be opposed to <url>, at all ? __label__1 Also I am willing to resume the discussion between you me and Direktor about the Legacy section. Would you be able to let me know on my talk page whether you are willing to do that in the near future ? __label__1 Do you want to connect your wiki with other systems?

Do you have a script that generates them from the heraldic descriptions, or do you make them by hand ? __label__1 Thanks, can we write an article on that ? do you think it is notable enough ?__label__1 What is the context that `initialize` is called? It claims to be the "Starting point for the program" -- is a call made from `__main__` that returns the return code of this function ? __label__1 I am looking at a more brute force and exhaustive approach, I am curious as to your performance / memory concerns. Is this something being done a lot or just once for different sets of letter combinations ? __label__1 This is probably more of a timing issue than anything else. Can you provide some information as to the actual application of this to whatever you ' re doing ? __label__1 Title is pretty incoherent. Proposed edited title: "Does the 'cat' argument in query _ posts fetch posts from subcategories as well as the given ID?"__label__1 Do you want a rating based on difficulty or one like the ESRP (blood, violence, sex) etc? Or Both ? __label__1 `lte IE 8` means "less than equal IE 8" so this seems to work as designed. Can you clarify what the problem is ? __label__1 I wonder if your instance ( s) of Persist are in a local scope that gets destroyed upon exiting that scope. Have you looked into that ? __label__1 What filters are you hooking to? Can you post one of your functions that fails to modify the _ content ? __label__1 Please add some clarification: Do you have a string and you want to know if the string contains a valid double such as 2 . 56? Or, do you have a list and you want to know if it has duplicates values ? __label__1 Thanks for adding stuff to the update. Would you like to help out with the notifications (the real pain of this .. grr)?__label__1 You never said *why* you want to do this. What ' s the problem with the current setup ? __label__1 I suppose you managed to connect your RMI registry and look up your remote object, right? Can you provide stacktrace (on client / server)?__label__1 This is the sort of question where there is no single answer.

Do they have to be axis - aligned (i . e., have the same orientation as the rectangle)?__label__1 Pk, Please give me a idea. If we define primary menu like secondary menu, then primary menus ( default) will be displayed or not ? __label__1 Also I noticed you made new Europe and USA maps for this and <url>. Do you think it would be good to have a world map for <url>?__label__1 It ought to show up in the Delphi Window _and_ in DebugView. Can you confirm that ' s happening ? __label__1 Hi, I ' m new to RC patrol, and I was wondering how you do the 'reverted edits by X to version by Y' edit summary.

Can you tell me what information would help you understand the game play ? __label__1 Can you specify how the automated build tool invokes the click event?

Am I referencing a keyword by mistake ? __label__1 Have you checked the actual SVN server to make sure the file was added? Did they Add and check in or just Add ? __label__1 Hi Editorofthewiki, both images are just fine. I don ' t see an open review for the article; is there somewhere in particular you ' d like me to make this comment, if not just here ? __label__1 That ' s good news. Isn ' t there a Sherlock Holmes quote about how the answer to a mystery is never that something impossible has happened? :-)__label__1 @PeterAllenWebb - can you define 'Not in the list'. If I have {2, 3, 5} is the answer 1 or 4 ? __label__1 I couldn ' t reproduce the odd behaviour mentioned. Can you please post a complete, minimal and compilable version of code allowing to reproduce the problem ? __label__1 Have you set up venue and name as properties correctly? i . e. written KVC compliant accessors or used @property and @synthesize ? __label__1 I accept your point and won ' t classify as Military of Japan. What would be a better desciption for these historical Japanese soldiers ? __label__1 Just looking at that photo and the one in the article makes me feel cold :). I just finished this article <url> a week or so ago, and wonder if those Forward Operating Locations are tied into intercepts from those NORAD radar sites ?__label__1 Well i would do that but i don ' t know how to. Maybe you can show me on thizs example please ? __label__1 I don ' t know, but that doesn ' t make any sense to me. What do you think ? __label__1 What was wrong with PostAffiliate? I was going to use them ? __label__1 Thanks for your reply. So just to clarify then, you are happy with the number of references, but you just need me to convert each of them into ref / footnote format, and then the article is GA - ready, is that correct ? __label__1 There is a very nice moving picture at <url> which illustrates the bisection method. Can we get it for our version ? __label__1 Could you specify 'earliest possible records'. 1950, 1900, 1500, ..?__label__1 Is the table structure fixed? For example, will there be different spans ? __label__1 No problem, done.

Can look at this report please <url> ?__label__1 Setareh: I ' m not sure if you mean that PRINCE2 suits large projects but not small ones, or vice versa.

Does the draft need to be updated to include the tweaks ? __label__1 They ' re back again - this time with IP 37 . 105 . 37 . 15 (also from Saudi Telecom Co DSL).

What operating system are you running designer on ? __label__1 What happens if you export the layer to a gdb featureclass - does it have coordinates? Does the exported fc ' s spatialreference match that of zlevels ? __label__1 I ' m afraid <url> is slightly under the 5x expansion threshold. Could you please see my comments at <url>?__label__1 Not offended - let ' s talk about it. Doesn ' t "Avatar" refer to the series as well as the character ? __label__1 You were right that there was a problem, but I see Xn4 has now had a go at it. Perhaps you could look at it again ? __label__1 can you build the string with these bind variables explicitly mentioned? i . e to construct the string by concatenating the string with both constant strings and the variables ? __label__1 I ' ve been going through <url> and replacing the FiveHorizons . com refs (per Quadzilla99 ' s comments). However, refs 39 and 40 don ' t seem to appear anywhere else; could you perhaps replace them with more reliable sources if you get the chance ? __label__1 Limericks? Do you mean "mnemonics"?__label__1 Also, your question is a bit unclear to me. Can you provide an example of what `array` could be ? __label__1 So far so good? Drop me an email sometime, ok ? __label__1 Is the crack getting bigger? After you fix it, what happens when you say it comes back ? __label__1 Interesting concept. Have you tried just adding them to a list as you get follow notifications ?__label__1 sounds like a permissioning issue on the linux box. have you tried chmod ? __label__1 the screw supposed to fasten the lever. can you send a couple of pictures ? __label__1 This photo is part of a series of shots of my boat taken on my camera, for me, by someone (I didn ' t know who pressed the button) on the chase boat. Suggestions ? __label__2 By successively you meant increasing? If you have [a _ 1 , a _ 2 , a _ 3,..,a _ n], you want the largest set of the form a _ i <= a_{i+r} <= a_{i+2r} <= .. <= a_{i+kr} ?__label__2 I think I ' m gonna request a free image from a Wikipedia biography subject by following <url>. I was wondering, if I ' m planning to upload the image to Commons and the subject doesn ' t speak English to understand the e - mail, what should I do ? __label__2 P . S: Your exams end in May 10th?

Is it acidic or just the flavor ? __label__2 @DVK in O ( 1) space? - where does the count for each element fit ? __label__2 Can you help patroling <url> page??__label__2 Also - for some reason images on image pages now appear in full size when I view them, rather than more convienient viewing sizes. Do you know how I can fix this ? __label__2 That was a <url>, rather than an <url>. Is that what you intended ? __label__2 2 . 1. looks like it is testing that pj is in the "interior" of the convex angle defined by pi - 1, pi, pi+1. In that case, can ' t 2 . 2. be modified so that it tests that pj is in the "exterior" of the convex angle defined by pi+1, pi, pi - 1 ? __label__2 Ok the table has few nvarchar columns , couple float columns ,a ntext column I observerd that the error is caused when I am filtering for the columns but couldnt find which column or row ? __label__2 I beat you to it by about a minute. Which would you like to remove ? __label__2 There is a recommendation on the talk page of the "<url>". What do you think of it ? __label__2 What Models do you have in your app? are these items stored under a different model ? __label__2 This looks awesome, but I got lost at "You connect the two plates together with some solid core power cabling you can find at your local hardware store.". What is "solid core power cabling"?__label__2 There ' s no reason why any `img` tags loaded from the url at `$(this).attr('href')` shouldn ' t load the image. Do you get any errors in your error console (or JavaScript console, depending on browser)?__label__2 There ' s a basis for your hypothesis: see http://photo . stackexchange . com / questions / 4115 / problem - with - fluorescent - lighting - and - shutter - speed for examples and a discussion. Do you also see color shifts towards yellow or green ? __label__2 Anyone please? A response ? __label__2 Can you load the console app and see if there are any relevant Finder or backupd error messages under 'All Messages'? Nice profile pic btw - reboot ? __label__2 As to our last discussion, you said that <url> wasn ' t comprehensive enough and didn ' t show clearly its goal. Do you have any suggesting to improve this template ? __label__2 Actually, I was referring to all of the redlinks within the article. Is that not the correct Template to use in that case ? __label__2 @JavadocMD you are correct, I must have missed that. This brings up a larger issue: if your question is part of another question, but was not answered as part of that question, should you cut a new question ? __label__2 I think your question is a bit unclear. When you write add / attach do you mean you want to insert it into the post ? __label__2 So you ' re basically looking for the intersection between two non - axis - aligned rectangles? (Or, if they collide at all?)__label__2 The problem using mapreduce here, is that you need a common key to feed your reducer. How is the compareTo() going ? __label__2 Ermenicem de var.

Are you asking about ways to specify a particular moment in time that will still be unambiguous thousands of years in the future ? __label__2 Is this a homework problem? Whats the dataset from ? __label__2 This seems really specific to this particular program. Does it come with a manual ? __label__2 Howcheng, <url>u2014Great pic, but needs size, and the readers are caught between small at 550px or huge at full res. I wonder whether 600px would be possible, with a link to the interactive wideview function at the end of the blurb ? __label__2 What are your views on <url>? And how can you provide a source for a signature ? __label__2 Did the interviewer say _what_ he didn ' t like about your response? Also, what in particular about your algorithm seems naive to you ? __label__2 You want to generate an image like that given the original Van Gogh as input? Can you clarify ? __label__2 Minimum number of pictures per card, or minimum number of pictures given that there are 8 per card? Also, does every picture have to be matchable ? __label__2 The <url> states that ''Endymion'' was an <person>, and the only one of five actually built. Does Conway mention this ? __label__2 Well, if you have a O ( V+E) algorithm, I ' m really interested! Could you post it here ? __label__2 I think what #8 means is: that it has either one value or all nulls. Wouldn ' t Min ( Null) = Null return all nulls ? __label__2 Welcome Heather! Can you post a detailed step - by - step list of what you did, what behavior you expected, and what the actual behavior is ? __label__2 are you looking at the site from the exact same browser? no compatibility mode etc ? __label__2 Is this question about the algorithm itself (ie. you are positively sure that your implementation is error - free, but you don ' t understand why the algorithm outputs this particular result), or about your implementation (which you suspect is erratic and therefore gives wrong results)?__label__2 I was wondering why I couldn ' t edit the list of micronations article to correct the alphabetical order. was I blocked ? __label__2 Can you describe the content of the flash application? From the question, it sounds like it includes multiple HTML files, and not just a single .swf - is that correct ? __label__2 Duplicate of [Why does my computer freeze when I unplug my headphones?](http://apple . stackexchange . com / questions / 828 / why - does - my - computer - freeze - when - i - unplug - my - headphones)?__label__2 <url> needs urdu script for the name of the subject (Bangla script has already been added). Can you help ? __label__2 I don ' t think it should be tagged as a multiplayer game since that isn ' t given by the OP - it could be human vs AI. And by 'type dependency', are we talking the classic rock->scissors->paper->rock type thing ? __label__2 Need help with EF 175 via email. Mind <url> so we can discuss ? __label__2 Thank you for semiprotecting that page. Why is it that everyone seems to vandalize one page at the same time ? __label__2 Yes, your description is correct at a general level. Is there something about that description which doesn ' t make sense to you ? __label__2 I generally use evince which updates whenever the file has changed (also I generally compile directly to pdf). Maybe it is possible to configure xdvi so that it watches for file changes ? __label__2 I might have just done a wrong revert on this art - what do you think? Small cf Singapores Changi maybe - but, ..?__label__2 Can you define what you mean by best? Best as in the most secure regardless of cost or something that has the best of everything, small, lightweight and good value for money ? __label__2 I ' m confused by this sentence - "I ' m looking for an algorithm that will simplify and smooth the polygon, (reducing the number of vertices) with the constraint that the resulting polygon must contain all the vertices of the detailed polygon.". How do you reduce the number of vertices, yet retain them all ? __label__2 These are getting tagged as orphans and stubs. Are they SIAs, do you think ? __label__2 Besides altering the value in web . xml? Are you asking to pro grammatically update the web application ' s WEB - INF / web . xml file ' s init parameter ( s) for a given servlet based on some condition you detect at runtime ? __label__2 When I was with Slackware, I used to type `startx` after logging in, so I think that was me who start the X server (and not root). Is that what you are asking for ? __label__2 Everyone knows that umpiring is deterministic. ..right? :D__label__2 It ' s a bug to multiply a scalar amount by an array. Do you mean to be computing the sum of the weights ? __label__2 do you have to build queries to obtain results? SQL - style ? __label__2 So you want the individual "points" in your final Perlin - noise - shaped function to have a random distribution instead of the normal distribution? And do this while still having a perlin - shaped map ? __label__2 As a rough look over, the splits look ok to me (although yes, more discussion before forking is generally a good thing). If you think there are serious problems with them, why not just address it on the talk page ? __label__2 Great answer! Just for those not familiar with `\makeatletter`, could you please add `\makeatother` at the end of your code ? __label__2 No answer. Do you want to take it to ANI, or should I ? __label__2 Are you saying this doesn ' t compile elsewhere? Ie this is xcode specific ? __label__2 Yea, that one crossed my mind. It didn ' t seem like the best rails - y way, ya know ? __label__2 Correlated with what? Each obs to the one before it ? __label__2 Is there a way you can advise on how I can get my page back to make edits to it??__label__2 I noticed you have improved the "human rights" section on the article <url>. Could you update the main article: <url>?__label__2 Automating in what way? What information do you want to extract ? __label__2 The FAQ says Stack Overflow covers "matters that are unique to the programming profession," and this seemed to me like such a matter. Or did I miss something ? __label__2 Do you feel that you ' ve had success in forming consensus here within your knowledgebase? What do you feel are the underlying reasons behind your current ban from Wikipedia ? __label__2 @prp, regarding the edit, so you want after the first iteration and removal, to remove the new adjacent pairs that occur now? and continue that until no adjacent - pairs are left ? __label__2 Where would I find paramount crystals??__label__2 @Mathew - Very well written, but this is really more of a forum - style call to discussion than a stack - exchange - style question with a definitive answer. For now, have protected it to avoid short answers from new users, but what is the goal of this question ? __label__2 I ' m not sure I understand the threat scenario you ' re trying to protect against - what don ' t you want to happen? Is it getting validated by you without contacting the 3rd party ? __label__2 Well, what other information does DIA give you about the functions for which this occurs? To start with, what are the names of these functions ? __label__2 woow.. sorry but this is ugly, ugly, ugly. Why do this if other packages already do the work for you ? __label__2 This is sort of a vague question. What sort of correspondence are you looking for ? __label__2 I can ' t reproduce this. can you post a link to the image with this behavior ? __label__2 @Sekar: I would expect to see that error on PHP < 5 or on Windows less than version 5 . 3. Can you confirm that you are running on RHEL (Linux) and your PHP version is 5 . 2 . 5 ? __label__2 Is "Windows" a good alternative to Wine? Is there a stable release yet ? __label__2 How does the data look? List A = {(3, 5), (5, 6), (1, 2)} and B would be all the points ? __label__2 I was told by a wikipedian that these following three sources are unreliable <url>. Is that true ? __label__2 See my update. have you tried pushing the fitting back in (sort of aggressively)?__label__2  " moving" map? Do you mean "mobile" map application ? __label__2 Understood. When using this sort of method, you are not in fact launching a separate thread each time the callback is called, correct ? __label__2 This kinda seems like a recipe request to me. Is there something other than bad spinach that you ' re trying to solve ? __label__2 The session . py [link](http://pastebin . com / 65DNHqUR), the util . py: [link](http://pastebin . com / AXMM7ALK) and the const . py: [link](http://pastebin . com / ww2QQEtQ) (= the Yahoo information) So I suppose the const . py is not correct ? __label__2 Hi Ive been trying to clean the English version of this and the abandoned village to see if they can be on "did you know". Could you check the pages and get back to me ? __label__2 Hey, doesn ' t look like anyone at <url> are concerned about our move proposition? Could you close the request, and move the article back to <url>?__label__2 btw, do you think we should mention the effect right off the bat of the descripition ( seeing as "effect" is listed right above it??__label__2 I think those are actually two questions, none of which I understand properly. Could you please expand your questions, so that we get of better understanding of what you ' re looking for ? __label__2 You are calling this numerous times: for a lot of different values of n? Is their a pattern for the values of n ? __label__2 I have a similar problem, @Milos. This room wouldn ' t happen to be directly above a poorly - insulated garage, would it ? __label__2 Can you start X? What resolutions do you have available ? __label__2 Point taken. Would you like to be a mod ? __label__2 What if there ' s 7 pages, and you ' re on page 4? `[1]..[2][3][x][5][6]..[7]`?__label__2 I agree that some matters are best left relatively unheard of. Perhaps the creation of some explaining diagrams is in order; have you ever thought of adding descriptive images to the wing configs article ? __label__2 Yikes. We didn ' t ever really get a satisfying conclusion to this one did we ? __label__2 This is a bit off topic for Home Improvement. Have you tried contacting the company ' s customer support ? __label__2 I guess the best thing to do for now, is to not do anything and see what happens. Don ' t you agree ? __label__2 @antony, the thread you linked put data about this in spoiler tags. Do you think the answer would qualify as spoilers ? __label__2 I can understand how rivers flow, but how do canals flow? Is it from the highest point to the lowest ? __label__2 Well, rule 3. is closely related to rule 2., so I presume you cannot have [0 . 01 0 . 04] and N=10? Who defines the sum ? __label__2 From looking at the talk page archive, I see you you were a voice of moderation at <url> some time ago. Care to weigh in there again ? __label__2 I might have just done a wrong revert on this art - what do you think?

Have you turned up the compiler optimization ? __label__2 Thanks. Can I save your last line as ammo in my next edit war ? __label__2 Could you please clarify - did you receive these errors when attempting to boot the new kernel or when attempting to compile the kernel? If the latter, was the compilation performed from within a running system or from an alternate environment such as a live cd ? __label__2 Can you provide a complete example? An example graph, with the expected result, and a clear definition of critical nodes / paths ? __label__2 How r u doing? what are u upto these days?..what are your current contribs ? __label__2 Hi, You may like to look at his page when you have time; I guess it typifies "guys who want to disseminate info on the subject" vs "guys trying to clean dab pages". Or am I missing something somewhere ? __label__2 JIT? You mean android Jit? you using jruby in android ? __label__2 Are you trying to minimize the material cost, or just beat the commercial version ' s price? How much do the commercial ones cost, roughly ? __label__2 As you say that you ' re not concerned about holidays (yet), is it fair to say that there ' s a fixed number of working minutes per week for a given SLA? If so, can you just divide SLA time by minutes - per - week, and then sort out the remainder ? __label__2 Thanks for your input. Can we live with this version of <url>?__label__2 Try using `zypper`? Also, can you post what errors you are getting, please ? __label__2 Adam, I am not familiar with buddypress but I think you can normalize the query quite a bit using joins (and avoid sub - queries all together) which are more performant. Is there any technical requirement for your sub - query approach ? __label__2 I write to you, because I think that this issue should be addressed at some central place - for all lists / rankings, so that we don ' t have to go over the same discussion separately at each place. Could you arrange such discussion or point me where to raise the issue ? __label__2 As you ' ve noticed, I ' m on a tear through general topology, which was going well, until I went to revise / merge / update <url>, when I stumbled on a very simple conceptual issue. Could you look at the talk page, and tell me what I ' m doing wrong ? __label__2 Do you need to do this more than once in your program? And do you need more levels of indirection, such as `foo . baz . qux . name == foo . name`?__label__2 I am curious why it ends at 3 October 1901. Have there been no rulers of Kabul since then ? __label__2 @Mark Trapp, a similar question has already been closed on StackOverflow.

Maybe loading another assembly ? __label__2 Check out the devanagari on Heart Sutra. Is that what you wanted ? __label__2 what do you mean? how do I resolve this ? __label__2 I have now returned from vacation and struck everything.

Are you going to do the same, or do you need the grayscale images to be created dynamically ? __label__2 But someone actually remade the article here, http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / User : DOSGuy / Joe _ Siegler it ' s a subset of someone ' s user profile, but they are essentially circumventing a deleted article. Is this against wikipedia policy ? __label__2 Perdon, la pregunta no esta claro. Puedes tratar a simplificar la pregunta ? __label__2 It ' s doing what you ' re telling it to do. Can you tell us what the problem is ? __label__2 Wait, I answered too quickly.

Can you please explain things more carefully ? __label__2 Unable to find which assembly ? Could you provide the stack trace or a more detailed error message ? __label__2 This seems rather subjective to me, as well as being possibly too wide - ranging. Wouldn ' t "How to make a good game", even for just 1 genre, seem to be a book - length topic ? __label__2 We ' ll need a little more code to help! The fact that you declared it inside a UIView shouldn ' t make any difference at all; can you put a breakpoint inside your UIView to prove that the code is actually running ? __label__2 Sorry, I will check into this next week. Have you preserved UTF - 8 (see comments on top of the wikEd code)?__label__2 I thought I read about that as a feature of MobileMe, but I just looked and cannot find it. Have you signed up for a trial yet ? __label__2 Can I see what "img2" is? Is that an image component ? __label__2 Are you looking for 3d models? Or 3d looking 2d images ? __label__2 OK, just found it: simply press "Enter" to jump to the next occurrence. Why is it not the standard F3 ? __label__2 What about invalid states (e . g. all Os or both sides with 3 - in - a - row)?__label__2 Did you try an iisreset? Maybe an old version of your assembly is still in cache ? __label__2 What if you attach the MDF file to SQL Server Express and inspect it using SQL Server Mgmt Studio Express?? Do you see anything??__label__2 An interesting observation: when doing a TimeMachine backup to a network drive TimeMachine will automatically mount, backup and then unmount the remote TimeMachine share on the network drive. I wonder if you could exploit that to achieve what you want ? __label__2 I understand that this title refers to a particular arrangement of BWV 1068, but I get the sense that today it has taken the meaning of ''any'' arangement of the piece. Could we note this in the article, or is this not true at all ? __label__2 Normally I point at http://developer . android . com / guide / developing / device . html, but it sounds like you already have the Windows setup done.

Would you happen to remember where you got it from ? __label__2 Does the error show up with any data set? Is there a minimum reproducible test case ? __label__2 Looking through the discussion page history, the addition was made by <url> who is still active on wikipedia. Why not try a message on <url>?__label__2 As far as I ' m aware, the only Canon 200mm with Image Stabiliser (IS) is the EF 200mm f / 2L IS USM.. but that was released in 2008? There ' s 300mm f / 2 . 8L and f / 4L both with IS, or 200mm f / 2 . 8L or f / 1 . 8L without IS which this might be ? __label__2 @Piskvor: ha ha.. apparently not me! It was meant to be a pun on 'Are there atheists in foxholes?'__label__2 Have you and I reached a compositional (English, not content) impass? Perhaps we should hash it out away from the article and install after having reached teh big A (accomodation or agreement)?__label__2 Almost a month has passed. You still up for it ? __label__2 I couldn ' t help but notice on your userpage templates for Clive Barker, Child ' s Play and so on to place on pages related to those subjects. I ' ve never known how to create them, so could you help ? __label__2 Thanks! Rhetorical question: is it really so difficult to read our username policy ? __label__2 you want to make the select box sticky, is that correct? meaning that if one value is selected and the user posts the page, when it returns the previous value is still selected ? __label__2 Mo being megabytes (MB)? Or is this some new memory size unit ? __label__2 I don ' t understand what you mean by groups. Are you asking for groups or points ? __label__2 Are you referring to an update from a 6 - 7 theme? or are you just referring to any random template (wordpress, joomla, static html / css etc) to a drupal theme ? __label__2 Just noticed that the "time" field is eliminated from the collapsable boxes. Could you make this something that is displayed when the box is expanded ? __label__2 Can it be used for any kind of departure?

By embedded view do you mean a view created with Views ? __label__2 An articulated body is not light on a physics engine as many shapes will be close to eachother and need to be tested for penetration (assuming they are jointed close together). What amount of shapes, what kind of shapes and what kind of contraints are involved ? __label__2 I don ' t think there is handy enough import into Google Calendar. Would WP dashboard widget work for you ? __label__2 Please, share more details, configured Application Pools, publishing configuration (realease, debug, ..).

When a user is blocked, is their IP address blocked also ? __label__2 OK.. ctrl+v behaves differently. What possible use is the local file location to a webapp though ? __label__2 @S . L. Barth Exponential in terms of what parameter ? __label__2 Looks like Illustrator CS4 can be scripted with JavaScript, VBScript and AppleScript. Would be nice if you could get your hands on the script they used to create these ring maps, huh ? __label__2 It ' s unclear how "regression" could be invoked in a *univariate* dataset. Also, exactly what distinction are you suggesting between the two bulleted methods ? __label__2 did you get it to work? how did you do it ?__label__2 And do you have the same version of your application on both machines? And are you actually starting the version of your application that you think you ' re starting ? __label__2 I ' m thinking of removing myself as an involved party from the arbitration case, because I ' m apparently really not on board with what Nightscream is trying to accomplish. Do you have any good reasons for me to remain ? __label__2 During transcoding, were the audio files upsampled? E . g. converting 8 - bit 11kHz to 16 - bit 44kHz ? __label__2 Apropo WTL - is there an atlernative supproted by MS that would allow to build lightweight, single file (no additional dlls to distribute) binaries in c++ ? :-) Or even c# ?__label__2 There are actually a lot of different ice - cream maker recipes that will produce very different overruns; can you specify how you ' re preparing yours ? __label__2 Did you get any result? Are you sure that the numbers are not separated by an other whitespace character, like a tab ? __label__2 I do have skype installed, but not running. does it need to be running to hijack 80 / 443 ? __label__2 I dont disagree with your blocking it as promotional but its only edit was to remove an obvious BLP violation and the user who reported it as promo - username restored the violation. Would you mine reinforcing the WP : DOLT essay to Teapotgeorge ? __label__2 That ' s my understanding as well. So what I ' m wondering is, how did you choose where to draw the lines on the map, if there haven ' t been any agreements ? __label__2 What do you get instead of the sorted array? What is the output ? __label__2 The animal has only just been discovered by western science: I ' ve seen no claim of any photograph having been taken.

DoSth' in Evaluate / Modify window ? __label__2 +1 good question. BTW, do you mean 1 - 2 cucumbers sliced rather than 1 - 2 slices cucumber ? __label__2 This seems a bit off topic to me. Perhaps more suitable for webmasters ? __label__2  ' Is it worth..' is very subjective. Can you rephrase your question in a more objective manner ?__label__2 It is being suggested on <url> that the recent round of editing of <url> in which you were involved amounted to no more than sanitisation. Perhaps you could advise ? __label__2 I don ' t have enough reputation. Can someone fix the spelling in the title ? __label__2 I think this question is too broad to be answered correctly. We will just have an endless list .. Why are you asking ?__label__2 Any recursive algorithm can be implemented as a loop if you manage a stack yourself instead of using the call stack. Is that sufficient for what you ' re after ? __label__2 Regarding <url> and others. You want me to speedy the wikipedia pages because the SVG tag was erroneously placed here rather than on commons, correct ? __label__2 Yes it is sorted. Can you explain ? __label__2 Welcome to the community. What exactly is your question ? __label__2 I have no idea what you mean, please describe your question better. What exactly are you doing, what is returned *where* and what would you expect ? __label__2 @Prof. Kalai: Would you please point me to a good reference on Scarf ' s non empty core condition for the case of stable marriage ? __label__2 @David: What *I ' d* like to know is, how you managed not only to read the question directly from John ' s mind but also to post the answer at exactly the same time as when John posted his question. Does it require much practicing? :)__label__2 I don ' t recall. Is there something there that could damage my computer ? __label__2 It seems to me that we have a language gap here. Reading your comments, are you trying to ask what happens with logic devices when you have a very slowly transitioning, or even static intermediate signal on an input to a logic gate ? __label__2 I ' ve had a go at sorting out markup for footnotes. Also many (most) of the external links were either direct - links or indirect - mentions of single research papers; I ' ve worked these up where possible, but should they be moved from "External links" to "References" or better still to relevent place in the artice as footnotes ? __label__2 I ' m sorry, but what is joejob? Or am I showing my ignorance ? __label__2 But make sure you have the right (error) line. What happens when you remove that last Requires ? __label__2 @fmark: Good for you. Why is this comment (from a thread that ' s now 3 months old, no less) directed at me ? __label__2 This one seems useful. Should we not turn those redlinks blue ? __label__2 @Chris: it ' s now the second time someone has repeated one of my questions. Copycatting to get votes ? __label__2 I ' m having trouble visualizing the floaty skirt car with sticks. Do you have any pictures ? __label__2 How does it look? Also, did you read my inquiry <url>?__label__2 <url> OrphanBot doesn ' t realize that <person> is a license tag. ?__label__2 It looks to me that you don ' t simply want to combine them, you want them to be merged them together evenly like a zipper or cars politely merging on a highway. Am I correct ? __label__2 I am in the process of responding to your message on my talk page. In the mean time, did Lochdale ever inadvertently expose his IP, such as editing while logged out and then logging in and signing ? __label__2 @zebonaut I ' m attaching here the pic of the backside of the circuit http://i . stack . imgur . com / BDBRS . jpg . Please take a look at the 55 pins, the output which is no . 3 is not connected to any part of the board? Could it be they just placed the pin to confuse ? __label__2 I remember seeing a table of bicycle laws in various states, but I forget where. A search isn ' t helping; does anyone remember seeing this ? __label__2 I ' ve searched my e - mail and can ' t find anything. Was there an earlier note about this on - wiki somewhere ? __label__2 I may be having trouble visualizing but in the first option it sounds like you ' re describing adjusting the size of a door rather than making / installing a jamb for a thin wall. Can you please clarify ? __label__2 My rationale for nominating <url> for CSD as promotional was that the show has not yet aired, so an episode summary at this point sounds like a promotional leak. Was I being overzealous ? __label__2 Is there any content that needs rescuing? The only edit I seem to have deleted was the redirect ? __label__2 I would never do that without consulting the blocking admin first (and probably I wouldn ' t either way). What do you say ? __label__2 Yes that was my question, thanks. As an aside, is it typical to split up the previous post (and i think you split up mine) to better answer questions and such on a topic by topic basis ? __label__2 <url>. Can you tell me if this date is for the arcade or Wii version ? __label__2 btw, true that Flash doesn ' t have proper bidi support, but you could still reverse the text yourself so it is displayed properly. also, what platform are you using ? __label__2 If I recall from my college days, shouldn ' t you be able to do this by setting up a set of equations and solving for the transformation? By the way, is this your homework ? __label__2 Well, can you tell us if the games _are_ independent? If not, how do they depend on each other ? __label__2 Okay, I desaturated it just a bit. What do you think of it now ? __label__2 Which operating system? (Sounds like some flavor of Linux?)__label__2 I am very confused right now. Please make it clearer to me how I vandalized ? __label__2 It appears that that article was deleted because not enough info was found on the person. Doesn ' t the new article have enough info ? __label__2 The Wikipedia page does not say anything about single electrons, and the original paper, "[Das magnetische Moment des Silberatoms](http://ww . springerlink . com / content / q47427674u801u22/)" seems to refer to silver atoms - not sure about this because the paper is in German and behind a paywall. Can you please clarify your answer ? __label__2 You are so right, <url> looks to be blatant advertising. Why don ' t you put it up for <url>?__label__2 The normal way is: You startx on machineA, open xterm, ssh machineB, start there the applications you want which then run on machineB bit are displayed by machineA ' s xserver. Could you explain with more detail why this isn ' t sufficient for you and what you want to achieve instead ? __label__2 Do you want to show this circle image on user ' s current location ? Please describe what exactly you want and where ?__label__2 Rann, Redmond, 2010 election all currently in vandal wars. Can I request temp protection ? __label__2 I think you have to specify your question more. Is the problem splitting the image, or doing the sobel kernel convolution ? __label__2 This is my first time at review - sorry if I blew it. The article passes just fine--what do I do at DYK to indicate that ? __label__2 Why not use a numerical counter, then convert it to text when you need to display it? What ' s in `element`?__label__2 Unfortunately, I ' m still worried this may not be enough to avoid arguments. <url> says "A separate rationale must be provided each time the image is used in an article." Should we just copy the tag for every article using the logo ? __label__2 What is your opinion on just having that page deleted? The spelling differences between that and <url> are more than minimal, as there are 4 differences between the two ? __label__2 Do you mean tough? Is it dry as well ? __label__2 Very interesting question, I hope this eventually gets some answers! Are you talking only about *disclosure*, or economic factors in improving security in general ? __label__2 Why do the width and height in the HTML differ from those in the CSS? Are you sure the shadow isn ' t just off - screen or something ? __label__2 if id=r2 is selected, id=r1 should be de - selected? de - selection of a radio button isn ' t captured by this ? __label__2 What do you mean by _if i don ' t use a custom menu_ ? Could you please describe more clearly under which conditions you get desired result and when not ? __label__2 It was a joke. I mean, surely, a carbon frame has a major carbon price tag ? __label__2 What is the (approximate) size of these two arrays? Is one much bigger than the other ? __label__2 So to clarify you want to paginate the ul ' s without loading a new page correct? In other words, if you grab 30 items you would want to show 3 at a time in a ul and have some sort of next / previous navigation that hides one ul and opens the next ul ? __label__2 It seems like this area of the photo is out of focus, in which case the only fix is to bring it into focus. Does this also happen in focused areas ? __label__2 Ok, thx for that. Can you put your comments into an answer so that it can be voted ? __label__2 I ' m doing the best I can. Anyway, do you know anything more about the logo or font which could be cited ? __label__2 Any infos why it exists? Have you checked the logs ? __label__2 I dont know how to apply the read only concept to a for - loop. Or do you mean why they say it is read - only ? __label__2 Could you recommend a good sump pump and battery powered backup sump pump ? __label__2 When you typed this: http://ww . google . com / search ? client=safari & rls=en & q=string+processing+algorithms & ie=UTF - 8 & oe=UTF - 8" What did you see? Anything you ' d like to ask **Specific** questions about ? __label__2 Here ' s <url> and <url>. Think these cleanings were appropiately made or were a few spots incorrect ? __label__2 Its not. But if it were balanced, is there an optimum way ? __label__2 I thought it was solved? Would you please put the content of your file ~/.gtkrc - 2 . 0 ?__label__2 I have problems to understand your question. About which URL / file . php are you speaking when you say "default "post edit" screen"?__label__2 Also, both <url> and <url> wikilink "hiatus", which goes to a disambiguation page. What meaning of the word did you intend ? __label__2 I am not an expert but I found the sentence "controlling for associated subscores when devising cut - off scores on each dimension of a measurement scale" a bit esoteric. Can you give me one more line of explanation (otherwise I found it difficult to understand the question) ?__label__2 Somebody keeps moving the Shannan Prefecture to Lhoka Prefecture. What is your view on this ? __label__2 I was just about to point that out. Is that permitted ? __label__2 sorry I changed it to _mockDbFactory . Object. is what what you were referring to ? __label__2 If a user asks for the deleted text of an article, I do restore the text they request to a page in their userspace (unless, of course, the text is something that should ''stay'' deleted). Do you want the text so you can improve the article in a userspace - subpage of yours and then move it back to an article when you ' re finished ? __label__2 You will probably need a licensed refrigeration mechanic to gas up the lines, and there may be licensing involved in giving it power, but other than that, you could DIY. Don ' t most places that sell them offer installation services, too ? __label__2  * cough* PHP *cough*. I ' m sorry - you were saying something about not worrying about the order of parameters ? __label__2 What country are you interested in? did you want to restrict to road routing ? __label__2 Solo, you really need to compare effective top tube length to truly understand the comparison. Make sense ? __label__2 The effect of these edits has been to circumvent policy and process to move the above article to non - verified, non - English article names without a discussion or consensus. Who will put this right ? __label__2 An article about a craver named <url> needs some work. Can you clean the article up ? __label__2 @RoryAlsop - Yeah, the other thread, while still somewhat broad, is much more limited in scope. Let ' s give this one a shot, please ? __label__2 I didn ' t catch the connection. Could you please explain further ? __label__2 Hope you get the concerns worked out. Question: Why is the bot using <nowiki><sup>2</sup></nowiki> instead of xb2 ?__label__2 Could you explain your question further? Is {10 , 10 , 10} supposed to output numbers from 00 to 99 ? __label__2 I searched through Graphserver source but couldn ' t find where it outputs geoJson. Could you please point me to that particular function ? __label__2 I still can ' t understand what do you mean. Could you rephrase question or add some information ? __label__2 Could you please elaborate on that? How can I construct a style with a named geometry in it ? __label__2 If you think that ' s appropriate, I have no objection. Perhaps hold off a couple more days to see if it persists ? __label__2 About ten days ago I made some changes in response to your comments. Can you please look at them and make your GA decision ? __label__2 Clearing caches will not really clear up space, it will just slow your page loading down until the cache is regenerated and fill up your memory again; and if there is not enough space to regenerate the cache, you will just experience the slow down. Anyway, the Desire has a half gigabyte of internal memory, it is roomy enough for almost anything you need after you moved applications to SD and your data should all be in SD as well, are you really sure you actually need more internal memory ? __label__2 Could there be quotes embedded inside quoted strings, and if so, how will they be escaped, i . e. `"Two by four (2""x4"")"` or `"Two by four (2\"x4\")"`?__label__2 Are there such term that is in common use? Where did you first find the two implementation name ? __label__2 This is something I haven ' t tried yet. Do you use a cutting board for this or do it straight on the counter ? __label__2 are you looking for an algorithm that is optimized for a single query? Or an [indexing strategy](http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Index_(search _ engine)) that will create the data structure given the 100MB source text so that all queries of similar nature will be optimized ? __label__2 Are you saying programmers get more angry than non - programmers? What are you saying ? __label__2 @Daniel: Can ' t reproduce with Windows 7 `cmd . exe`, and I don ' t remember a ever using a text - only (no curses or anything) command line application that reacts on ESC. Perhaps some shells pass ESC one (but what character code would that be?).__label__2 They aren ' t common for fairly good reasons. Is there a particular reason you need such a supply ? __label__2 I see. How ' d you do this time--did you communicate clearly enough to elicit a correct answer ? __label__2 @Tomalak Geret ' kal "extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet" - Do you see yourself asking this question, or a similar one somewhere in the future? Do you think people will find this page searching with a search engine ? __label__2 An error I can see is that you have defined a field called author and set a field called user.

Four corners, the outline of a square, a solid tile ? __label__2  " Now we know how powerful it is to convey our thoughts."

S. sales for Doctor ' s Advocate, which is at 1 . 7 million, yet the worldwide sales are 1 . 5 mil. Could it have really sold that much since leaving the top 40 charts ? __label__2 Version 1 . 2 . 0 has now been released: http://ww . redmine . org / projects / redmine / wiki / Changelog # 120 - 2011 - 05 - 30. Can you try that instead ? __label__2 Works fine for me in Firefox, in IE it does blink a bit and I don ' t really understand why. Is there any transparency in the image ? __label__2 @Bill the Lizard: You deleted my answer: in this way this question will never be answered which will harm my accept rate. Or am I mistaken ? __label__2 one other question. Would I still need to install mercurial on the remote server over SSH ? __label__2 Sometimes the display can freeze but the underlying processes are still going, so checking the logs was (and always is) a good idea.

What are those six articles ? __label__2 Do you get any error message? Does your success message show up ? __label__2 Yeah.. that ' s a good idea, but I thought that perhaps an online repo existed.

Do you publish a newsletter to which I could subscribe ? __label__2 @Dennis attenDANCE? like in SquareDance? :D__label__2 Which seems to be exactly in line with my point about album covers.

I ' m wondering if you think further blocks would be in order, or semi - protection for those articles ? __label__2 Nice problem, although proposing a solution is difficult because the criteria for a "good" solution can be defined in many different ways (and since a perfect solution might not exist, you need to define a measure of quality).

Or are you talking about a theoretic algorithm to calculate and render such a widget ? __label__2 I am not sure about better tag (I think this one is fine), but someone should edit the question to "What does a Field Theory mean?" or "What is meant by Field Theory?".__label__2 What is the perl code in question? What does your error _ log say ? __label__2 Adam I ' m running into the same problem.

Is there a way to do that with the automatic taxobox ? __label__2 It will be helpful if you can include the command that you used and the error message that you got when trying to install.

I can ' t undertand this site, isn ' t is also about SEO??__label__2 I understand the auditing, but I ' m a bit puzzled about the purpose of the beanMap and why you extract string valued properties. Can you explain what you want to achieve ? __label__2 What type of application is this? WebApp, Console, WPF, etc ? __label__2 Is there a reason your sample output for A1 doesn ' t contain C# and Perl? Aren ' t those included based on "2) items only in a1 and not in a2"?__label__2 I got some rather heated complaints that your userpage contains about three "fair use" images at the bottom of your userpage.

Or what environment are you trying to display the output in ? __label__2 There ' s so much of work related to Prague: I once created <url> but every bridge in Prague deserves an article.

That ok ? __label__2 I ' m sorry, but I don ' t have time at the moment - my dissertation is calling my name. Have you tried any of the other <url>?__label__2 Also, I was looking at the edit history for <url>, as I thought I had created the page (honestly I cannot remember), but the history prior to your move of the list to <url> is missing. Do you know what happened to it ? __label__2 In a webpage generated by Java (in what framework?) or in a Java GUI (using what Framework?)?__label__2 Can you create a short but complete program which demonstrates the problem?

Any better way than this ? __label__2 Are the preferences of people always constant or are they somehow weighted, ie. some poeple ' s preferences count more than others'?__label__2 The second one looks right to me.

What is difference between a programmer and coder ? __label__2 About the citations for plot details, which HighwayCello mentions above, I ' ve commented on this over at <url>. Maybe the whole discussion should be taken to the talk page of the article itself ? __label__2 An AfD was started for that page before you speedy - nuked it. Could you close <url> please ? __label__2 In fact, what I ' d like to propose here is that we take a bit more control, establish some stricter edit warring restrictions, unprotect the page, slap up an edit notice, and enforce them with blocks so that people can get back to writing the article. Do you think that would have a positive effect ? __label__2 Do you have ECE volume 4 (queen endings)? If so, how many diagrammed positions does it have ? __label__2 I don ' t know anything about relational algebra, but "having" is just the same as "where" except it can apply to an aggregate of a set. Is there any reason the relational algebra would differ ? __label__2 @Maxpm: This compiles for me in Visual Studios 2008. What compiler are you using ? __label__2 Also, by the way: there is no such operating system as "window XP 2003". Do you mean *Microsoft Windows XP* (a desktop operating system released in 2002) or *Microsoft Windows 2003 Server* (a server operating system released in 2003)?__label__2 Hi the table you removed was added after a discussion <url>, so please give us a reason why you removed it??__label__2 I think you understood.

Would you consider clarifying ? __label__2 @Neil: Please explain.

Is that what you meant, or as the author, is there some way I can just close it ? __label__2 I ' m tempted to close this as a withdrawn GAN since it ' s been open nearly 2 months and nobody wants to touch it. What think ? __label__2 You ' re asking about premade engines, but they ' re pretty specific things. What kind of game are you thinking of building ? __label__2 Yes, <url> already mentioned that <url>, and it seems that the concern was not addressed. Han Amos, could you explain your use of blocking templates in place of the blocking admin ? __label__2 I ' m still confused, unfortunately. Specifically, what could I do if I wanted to read the third line, for example ? __label__2 It seems like this question gets asked every week, but I can ' t find the original or any duplicates (they ' re probably being deleted).

Is there some other problem, or some other comment I didn ' t respond to ? __label__2 It ' s a possibility, but still leaves the problem that the terms are US Army jargon (at least, I don ' t recall hearing them anywhere else!).

Have you completed your review comments yet ? __label__2 @Jherico I ' ve dabbled a little in COM, though I can ' t think of anything in there that would accomplish this.

Do you want to know the user that created each process ? __label__2 @RoBYCoNTe: I tried to uncheck "ASP . NET" in the "Debuggers" section but it didn ' t change the behavior.

Can you post a screenshot of what you ' re seeing ? __label__2 Are you working with individual objects? Or object trees / graphs ? __label__2 i have some issues to change file permissions from my ftp client since it is not apache server. I cannot even see them.. do you know how can I solve this ?__label__2 Are you looking for absolutely all possible solutions or for all solutions of maximum length if multiple instances of such solution exist? in order words is solution of 2 sets of length 1 like {54}:{54} an acceptable solution 1 ? __label__2 True, true.

Perhaps I should re - frame it as legality ''"at the time"''?__label__2 Are you looking for simple string edit - distance comparison or full on semantic equivalence? e . g. is cat more similar to cart or feline ? __label__2 You have some efficiency constraints? How about finding all cycles, and excluding the non - chordless ones ? __label__2 Splitting the figure is likely to look very bad (unless you ' re writing a book and you have a figure that goes across facing pages like in the FAQ answer Lev Bishop mentioned).

Is there a lag ? __label__2 Wordpress is just an application framework, it ' s not a domain framework so its architecture must be rather rudimentary. What would prevent to integrate the wp skeletton inside a domain mvc framework for example ?__label__2 After the recent ruling where CTV was forced to sell the five Citytv stations (to Rogers), there ' s another problem I think few are aware of.. If CTV is allowed to keep the A - Channel station in Ottawa, they would own two stations there, as they already own CJOH. What do you think about that ? __label__2 Could you please show your setup . py file? Also why is your setup . py in C:\Python27 ? __label__2 i ' ve been reading a bit on different VNC clients (programmes, im sorry for my bad english expressions :-P) and what i get is that i can have different computers showing the same on all screens, but then i think that when i move the mouse on the first computer i ' ll move it on other computers as well? or am i getting something wrong ? __label__2 Anything else to add to this article?

What `TimeZoneInfo` properties are assigned to value and display text ? __label__2 Your current code would load page . php ' s content into the `<div id="test"></div>`.

Can you take care of <url> and <url>?__label__2 What is the declaration for `GlobalCWND` then? Does it have a `Ptr<ProtocolContext>` member ? __label__2 <url> is directly from the <url> website. However it doesn ' t have any copyright notice should I still flag it as a copyvio ? __label__2 I ' m not sure what you mean. The uploads will be public so you don ' t need to be logged in or anything, and the file checks can be done on the other servers after upload ? __label__2 No half cells no. The distribution of window sizes, smallest should be 1x1, largest.. I ' m unsure, perhaps 64x64 ? __label__2 I deleted the redirects <url> and <url> that were a result of the page moves. Is that all you needed ? __label__2 Hi. Are you still a "maybe" for the meetup ? __label__2 Normally I ' d welcome <person>, but in this case I think you are a better editor to do that as I ' m he - 0! Would you do the honours please ? __label__2 ahh.. so 'Wikipediholic' is preferred to 'Wikipediaddiction' .. so the malady is at least recognised, good. Where can one obtain help to fight this insidious addiction ? __label__2 For all we know they could easily just be two random numbers stored in a database somewhere with no actual mapping. Why do you want this - you want to scrape all the extensions off the site mechanically ? __label__2 So, did you get it to startup? What was it trying to do ? __label__2 Maybe you don ' t have the CHUD tools (Shark, Instruments, etc) installed ? Or maybe you decided to move them and now Xcode can ' t find them ?__label__2 Your contributions show no edits to any RfC ' s. Could you provide a link ? __label__2 That depends upon the audience.

Do you have any references that might help ? __label__2 I don ' t and as far as I remember, the gdb instructions / NDK has existed prior to 2 . 2.

Is it normal for 6 articles to have cut - and - paste identical substantial content on Wikipedia ? __label__2 Adding window . id didn ' t help the issue. What is strange is that testing this as a file works fine even in Safari, testing it on a server (localhost or remote) it does not work which leads me to believe it ' s some sort of security 'feature' ?__label__2 PicPush does seem like a perfect solution, I just haven ' t bothered with it because of the cost. Is there any reason you weren ' t happy with it Gary ? __label__2 Please _show the contents of `stf2`_. How is is displayed when it ' s logged ? __label__2 Good edit on Deuteronomy.

How did you do that ? __label__2 I ' m now thinking the second primary topic on <url> should just serve as an entry, like what you did to the Street Fighter dab <url>. Thoughts ? __label__2 @Joe Hmm, I guess I would call them both of those jam -- they seem to be approximately the same condiment to me. :) Maybe the mashed fruit one could also be called a conserve ? __label__2 I ' m following through here, with my comment on the original thread: Vote to close as S & A. On the other hand, perhaps (since this is particularly related to SE) we might carry this over to Meta ? __label__2 This is a [1985 Bridgestone 700](http://ww . sheldonbrown . com / bridgestone / 1985 / pages / 07 - bridgestone - 700 . html). @Paul, is this your bike ? __label__2 But without the space it looks fine. Where is your blog that has such poor CSS that `<code>NULL</code>s` looks like it has an extra space ? __label__2 Incorporation sounds like a good plan to me.

If I remember correctly, you said you planned on cleaning up after the bot tagged the images; is that still the case ? __label__2 About being part of a "collective" author on Wikipedia - about having your writing "edited mercilessly" by others - that sort of thing. I ' m "interviewing" a bunch of people over email - can I add you to my list ? __label__2 Is it a particular C++ implementation of the Towers of Hanoi? I ' m trying to see why you have tagged C++?__label__2 Hey, I see you ' ve been contributing! Time to lose the "leaving Wikipedia" box ? __label__2 @Haoest: It seems some friendly individual already edited the title to remove the "gay image". Have you tried a different threshold ? __label__2 Please expand on what you ' re trying to ask. Point out the differences of what ? __label__2 You suggest that the process occurs with replacement. Does this mean that you allow multidigraphs (with possibly multiple arcs from s to t)?__label__2 **I want to have something that starts with `$(this)` and ends with `.each()`**. Is there a particular reason for this constraint (seems kind of arbitrary)?__label__2 It doesn ' t look like you have any image loaded at the time you are calling this. Do you know how to wait for the image to load to ask for height and width ? __label__2 I can ' t find anything about Crimson Echoes' Gameplay.

Are you getting any error messages ? __label__2 What process are you starting? is it yours as well ? __label__2 @Sergei: Fair enough, but what I find remarkable are the people who not only prefer to devote their time to the everyday useful questions rather than "cool problems to work on" (fine), but also actively vote to prevent those of the opposite persuasion from answering these questions if they want thereby signalling that such questions and people are not welcome here, and that their presence makes this website worse. Does it ? __label__2 What happens if `C:\temp` contains both `C:\temp \ somepicture . jpg` and `C:\temp \ somepicture . tif`? Which file should `C:\temp \ somepicture` refer to ? __label__2 You say they are in `/stylesheets / images / XYZ/`, but you are searching them in `/images / dookum . in/` (no stylesheets).

How are you calling the exe ? __label__2 is this homework? how will this temp db be used ? __label__2 I clean up the <url> article a bit.

Do you want to nominate it or should I ? __label__2 How about through basement / crawl space, attic, behind baseboards?

Can you post the actual exported xps somewhere, and also provide some more information on how you are exporting, as well as what XPS viewer you are using ? __label__2 @Guillermo How do you get the lines ? Just in one time by **readlines()** or iterating on the file ?__label__2 Sure. A redirect how though ? __label__2 What is your question about?

Have an opinion to share ? __label__2 The article <url> doesn ' t give any sources we can check to prove that it ' s true.

Do you mean 27x1 . 25 tires ? __label__2 @Mark: Could you clarify something please? You start by remarking that there is an undecidable problem P that is recognizable, and then observe that if HALT were decidable then we could construct a decider for P. However, in the texts I have read, things are proved in the other order--the undecidability of HALT is used to demonstrate the existence of such problems P. Can you show the existence of undecidable yet recognizable problems without using the undecidability of HALT ? __label__2 Also, these kinds of questions are expressly frowned upon in the FAQ: "your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use __ for __, what do you use?”". Do you have a specific problem with specific requirements that you need a VM for ? __label__2 I added a simple out . println() message to the location where I am calling redirect and that output appears before any other output from the response.

Can you add your own features to a base plugin or do you need all the features written for you ? __label__2 I ' m sorry, I do not completely understand the question.

Does it also allow them to be listed from newest - to - oldest and separated into Russian and English references ? __label__2 Hi. Is there no chance that you could take a photograph of RCMP officers in the uniform we don ' t have a picture of ? __label__2 You haven ' t specified the filename in the example. Could that be it ? __label__2 How to check this? And if so, how to change ? __label__2 @FumbleFingers: Can you please make some explaining comments on your diagram? Where does the data come from ? __label__2 @Benjamin, it ' s almost the same but for weighted matching. Do you know how to find _lexicographically smallest_ matching using it and can you give me proof ? __label__2 Presumably because the compiler decides to pass arguments in registers, or because the stack still contains the required first argument. Does it _not_ work ? __label__2 `i = rand() % length;`. Maybe you mean `k = rand() % length;`?__label__2 Also, are all the workers equally suited for all the tasks? In other words, could it be that Worker A is better suited for T1 type tasks than the other workers ? __label__2 I ' d rather not discuss matters by email, if it ' s avoidable. Is this a confidential issue that cannot be discussed on talk pages ? __label__2 Even if the references to "Get a car" all point to the same object, the references still show up multiple times in the data structure. Do you have a flag on each Action and / or Task to indicate that it has been completed, and does not need to be executed again ? __label__2 While half - inching a citation from <url> to use elsewhere, I was reminded what a good article it is. Are you planning to take it to FAC at any point ? __label__2 The background image doesn ' t duplicate for me, [here ' s a demo](http://jsfiddle . net / Town / L7fDp/). Is it possible you ' ve got something else overriding the `background` definition ? __label__2 Not sure I understand what your bounty is looking for. This is a wiki, so there ' s no "one right answer" .. what ' s the criteria to win the bounty ? __label__2 I ' m getting some warnings. Warnings can cause my problem ? __label__2 so, the metrics should be Sigma(#friends _ in _ group ( u)) for each u in USERS ? [only for legal solutions] ?__label__2 Can you point to some atricle ( s) with a formal definition and a motivation for this problem? Maybe also with some upper and lower limit estimates, prior art etc ? __label__2 Yes the second for loop has no braces as it contains a single statement within it. Is the time complexity of the above O ( n^1 . 5) ?__label__2 Thank you for your answer. Could you please provide some reference (link) for the self - spreading malware attacks ? __label__2 Sorry I got called away. Which is the better main name "Vancouver Harbour Water Aerodrome" or "Vancouver Coal Harbour Seaplane Base"?__label__2 You added the ''persondata'' material. Did you want to add any substantive material ? __label__2 I haven ' t seen the LBE code, does it give any more information about why it won ' t initialize?

If two dots are both on and are adjacent is that one connection ? __label__2 I don ' t think removing that info is the correct fix. Just change the punctuation.. OK if I do so ? __label__2 Now I realized that the title of the question contains yet another expression “email me,” which is not mentioned in the text of the question. What is your question after all ? __label__2  . svc address is the proxy \ uri? same about .wsdl is the proxy \ uri address ? __label__2 Dumb question. The helper method isn ' t using LINQ is it ? __label__2 I think you need to provide more details as to what is the intended purpose of such a function. There is definitely no cryptographic hash function with that property, but maybe you are looking for something different ? __label__2 Did you try to run it? What did you see ? __label__2 They are all good: will you upload them to <url>s? Where is the water used now by the way ? __label__2 What is the output of the console? When you build on the phone ? __label__2 Does the device have an accelerometer? Otherwise, couldn ' t you filter out jumps between points that would imply that the device has moved insanely fast ? __label__2 I am not really sure where I take care of staticfiles, I am using the Django development server. I think that whats happening is what you wrote, the URL ' s ddealing with staticfiles are disabled upon turning DEBUG off, any idea what i should do ? __label__2 exactly! Any ideas ? __label__2 Dear Fred, your question is very general. You will get people saying "yes i intend" , "no I don ' t", but with regards to the feedback - what is it you expect to read ? __label__2 Finally, I checked with articles Plastid, Mitochondria and Mitochondrial genome, and see they all use the term 'genome', and that there is no suggestion that they have 'chromosomes'.

Or did you create the new username first, before asking me to change your old one ? __label__2 Hi Garey, could you help me understand your question a bit better ? GeoNetwork is requiring entry of metadata on a per - layer basis, where you ' d like to provide metadata at a higher level? How are you producing the metadata documents ? __label__2 BTW, I ' m not certain that Queen Victoria can be described as being the Founder without being somewhat misleading. What do you think ? __label__2 This feels familiar. Homework ? __label__2 How would you store those cached images? in your own NSArray ? __label__2 Two of your examples (salad & PBJ) probably aren ' t that great reheated. Might want to edit the question title? :)__label__2 I was wondering why you removed him from Category : Alameda. He ' s pretty famous around there and it would be notable to have him in the category of Alameda, wouldn ' t it ? __label__2 Thanks for your support. Could you check and give me your opinion on the debate at <url> and, in case you agree with me, ask Critzu to explain himself ? __label__2 Yes, but how big can it be? Do you have an upper bound on it ? __label__2 @treeface: The multiple conditions may not all be testing the same value, in which case `switch` would not work. How would you convert `if (age > 17) { LetInMovie } else if (parent == me) { LookTheOtherWay } else { SendTheKidHome }` into a `switch`?__label__2 Maybe one of your Processors died? Was it a dual core or more ? __label__2 I ' m sorry to see that. By the way, "TMI"?__label__2 I noticed you made many edits to India - related articles, and I was just wondering if you were Indian? If you are, where do you live ? __label__2 I ' ve tried a setter method as well. The var wasn ' t getting the value until after the app was closed and reopen for some reason ? __label__2 I have reviewed your nomination for <url>, and still have a question. Could you reply at its nomination ? __label__2 What version of Exchange server is this? <= 2003 or > 2003 ? __label__2 At least I am quite sure I need to keep my sourcecode available to anyone if I use the GPL library, and according to the discussions here http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 4577044 / complying - with - the - gpl - in - an - iphone - app - we cannot distribute any GPL application on the Apple App Store too. So it seems that the GPL license is really quite troublesome and I hope there are other options ? __label__2 You may want to take a look at <url>. Can you be specific on what "spamming" is in this context ? __label__2 What is the definition of `buffer`? Is it a local variable ? __label__2 You made a "minor change" to <url>; while I agree that it should have been reverted, I do not think a change of over 200 is minor. Can you explain to me the rules for minor changes ? __label__2 @Mana I ' m all for having the front page covered with DF :), but where in the world do you get the idea it ' s PC only? Or are you including all the operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac) under PC ? __label__2 And can you point me to a statement of that company where they say that they release their images into the <url>? Or can you provide proof that their copyright has expired ? __label__2 While the Curriculum and Campus sections could use some references, i think this is ready to go live. Do you know how to move this to the main article space ? __label__2 I ' m somewhat puzzled by your recent edits on the Harper page, which have left two different sets of footnotes. Could you please explain your rationale for the change ? __label__2 Surely that would mean each camera only received half as much light? Wouldn ' t that be a problem ? __label__2 `m= d[:,0 : 5] ` should return exactly first five columns of an array. what do you get instead ? __label__2 Question seems a little bit too open ended. Are you talking about working with databases as a module developer (CRUD) or just for general content queries (in which case I would suggest Views) or something else completely ? __label__2 can you give a little more detail. Maybe paste the exact error message ? __label__2 what exactly you mean by parsing? the conversion from your NSString number to unsigned long long ? __label__2 OK, just to make sure there are city, town, village as incorporated places, the townships are districts, and of course CDPs (I want to make the key right). Also, how many parishes are there (perhaps I should have asked this first)?__label__2 how do I edit the signature thing? - when i put the ~s ? __label__2 It is possible (though not likely IMO) that some strange quantum entanglement effect could lead to a computer that outputs its results before the input is received. Would that qualify as negative complexity??__label__2 @kalle43 what is the rest length of the springs? is there any tension without displacement ? __label__2 I suppose there could be several valid solutions? If that is the case, are you looking for some optimal solution in some sense ? __label__2 with that much data have you hit your db limit? are you on full sql ? __label__2 If this were lisp, the solution would be to use map: (map + '(100 100) '(2 3)) => (102 103). Maybe Ruby has a similar function ? __label__2 I ' m not really sure what your asking here. Could you clarify what you ' re having trouble with ? __label__2 I ' m running out of ideas of useful edits to do. Have you got any ideas ? __label__2 Please add more details: What happens when you try to play something? What sound card do you have ? __label__2 How is the structure "the same"? Do you need to capture the _letters_ between the _last slash_ and the _last dot_, or ..?__label__2 Weird thing is that setting ENV in environment . rb was ignore.

Can you re - phrase ? __label__2 I tried to replicate the issue but on my EVO images downloaded in the Gmail App don ' t get the name changed. This happens to every image you try to download ? __label__2 I don ' t think this should happen at all, unless there is something more to it than the code shows. And just out of curiosity, are you using any kind of accelerator ? __label__2 I have no idea. Maybe it just needs a few days to update or something ? __label__2 Haha, hey guys. Who is Temple alumni ? __label__2 @Chin: As Peter said, you should clarify the scope of your test. What do you want to achieve with your test (performance, throughput, scalability)?__label__2 Can you check if there was ever an article for "Kenneth Eng"? It seems to have been deleted, if so could you supply me with an archive of the article ? __label__2 did you set the classpath in `Publish Settings > Flash > ActionScript 3 . 0 Settings > Source Path`? are you debugging in a browser ? __label__2 I see. Maybe you should have updated the version to 1 . 0 . 1 (or something like that) to indicate that it is a new version? :)__label__2 I don ' t see "parent" at all. Maybe it exists in your templates ? __label__2 Are A and P allowed to be reals? or Must they be Integers ? __label__2 And what you want to have after adding the kernel?

What do you think ? __label__2 Inch es gartsum? <url>..do you have email by the way ? __label__2 The title references `apt - get` but the question is about `wget`. Which one of the two are you interested in ? __label__2 Please edit your question and title to more clearly address what you ' re seeking. Perhaps something like "Is there an explanation, including diagrams, of Ubuntu ' s USB stack?"__label__2 In conclusion, I ' m split. What do you think ? __label__2 How are you testing what ' s actually stored? Are you using HeidiSQL or another GUI client ? __label__2 I also spoke to <url>, who wanted a lot of the WW2 information.

For example: (0, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 0)?__label__2 @StealthRT - That seems to me like more of a problem with the .NET framework then rather than Visual Studio. Try re - installing the .NET framework as I think I am correct in saying that a re - install of VS won ' t necessarily re - install this ? __label__2 what do you mean by 'events'? string data like from calls to TRACE, software events (dll load / unload) or hardware events (device plug / unplug)?__label__2 Why does it need to run continuously? Is the data changing ? __label__2 I don ' t think you can find the max weight cycle without enumerating all cycles. How would you decide which one to not enumerate ? __label__2 What is this line graph that you mention? Are you saying that the smaller graph is always a simple path ? __label__2 What are you storing in the picture field?

Is he on wikibreak or something ? __label__2 I ' m stumped; I ' ve got no idea what ' s happening. Can you please explain ? __label__2 I see unbalanced brackets. Is line 21 in C:?__label__2 An interesting problem, but it ' s not totally clear what do you mean by "compact". Could you give a definition, please ? __label__2 Works Ok for me - in fact you don ' t even need the 's' variable. What is it about that which doesn ' t work ? __label__2 How can I determine that it is corrupted? What are possible causes of corruption ? __label__2 I have to admit that I am wary of the word "compromise" because I honestly do not understand what purposes are better served by KSmrq ' s version than by mine. Can someone fill me in ? __label__2 that ' s all it said on the description of the object, I myself do not know as well what the museum means with "old". Maybe it came from the theater from a previous renovation ? __label__2 Hi, that "Multics Virtual Memory: Concepts and Design" paper is already in the list of Multics papers (in the "Further Reading - Technical Details) - it even has the same URL!

What line does the error message correspond to ? __label__2 @Brendan personally I would tell your Host that CentOS 4 . 8 is not an option and you must have 5 . 0, generally speaking it ' s a giant no no for a host to change your version on you like that, esp if you have CLI access which usually means you ' re dedicated or VPS, they need to put you on the proper version. Outside of that would Mercurial or Git serve your purposes ? __label__2 I ' m inclined to think that something is shelling out an `http://` address request. Is Firefox your default browser ? __label__2 The topic is a good one I think, but the year of closure should be listed. What do you think about adding the year of closure & dropping the "in the 1970s and 1980s" in the title ? __label__2 Thanks, but I didn ' t see the 10 , 00 to 40 , 00 , 00 numbers there.

Maybe something like "Looking for a measurement of the time it takes the gas to attain equilibrium"?__label__2 Hi there, I always thought <url> was originally AE & CI, not AE & I. Do you have a reference for AE & I ? __label__2 Do you want your `visiblePhotos` to scroll off the edge or wrap around or what? Where is the `visiblePhotos` array created ? __label__2 I found <url> which is completely unreferenced but I could not find any confirming sources. Is this a proper term, or even a hoax ? __label__2 did you ever finish this game? Can we find it somewhere ? __label__2 it works for me, i get ~100kB html data using the original example. btw, what do you mean by *whole website* ?__label__2 Accepting that military aircraft accidents are generally not notable enough for a stand alone article, what are your thoughts on the crash of a Mosquito at an airshow at Manston in 1948 that killed ten members of the public as well as both crew. Notable enough to sustain an article or not ? __label__2 Is this a real question? What ' s the given area ? __label__2 I re - drew the captions on the tugboat diagram <url>.

Is the BOTs image from the same base map as the lead image ? __label__2 I just retried it on my Ubuntu 9 . 04 server (which is just an old desktop with server installed, and it ran fine). Out of curiosity do you have the intro turned off ? __label__2 I certainly listed pertinent classwork for each position I applied for on my resume. Why wouldn ' t you ? __label__2 On a different subject, does this article pass <url> and / or <url>? Could it be linked from <url> as the next album ? __label__2 This seems to have become a standard put - down of yours<url>, but can you translate ''Go maith leith scxe9al'' <url> for me? Or did you mean ''Gabh mo leithscxe9al''?__label__2 More likely than not it has to do with the way visual studio optimizes the loops. Can you post the generated assembly ? __label__2 Where did you read this? Could you please provide a link ? __label__2 Hi, I have opened a discussion at <url>. Perhaps you would like to contribute ? __label__2 where does the $ID variable coming from? are you sure it ' s a valid ID ? __label__2 Could you please explain. Since I ' m not accessing the database while loading the page the first time, can it really be the reason, even if it is something I need to look into as well ? __label__2 Are you sure your DerivedType is inheriting from BaseType. Can you post more code ? __label__2 what do you have? windows, mac, other ? __label__2 what output do you expect? is it something like `1 2 3 4 \n 5 6 7 8 \n 9 10` or `0 0 0 1 \n 0 0 0 2 ..`?__label__2 First off, great work at the <url> article. I ' m just wondering why you changed the sentence back to "During this period, defense expenditures underwent exponential growth allowing an unprecedent level of weapon acquisitions and the rapid expansion of the <url>." from "During this period, defense expenditures underwent exponential growth allowing an unprecedent level of weapon acquisition and expansion of the <url>." The version I changed it to is more grammarically correct, don ' t you think ? __label__2 In the one that works, you ' ve got a space between the URL and `no - repeat`. What happens if you add a space between the URL and `no - repeat` in the ones that don ' t work ? __label__2 I wish to have my Wikipedia account deleted. Is that possible ? __label__2 But what are the actual values? Can you print them ? __label__2 Huh, I ' ve never actually bothered to use Google Book search. I ' ll e - mail you some stuff shortly, but here ' s another topic for thought: can we find any more stylistic characteristics for the genre aside from its association with underground art, its roots in punk and punk forms (hardcore and post - punk), and the fact that, judging by their lyrics, a lot of the artists seem to be miserable bastards (I love how the 1990 EW link makes a point of this)?__label__2 Does the command lines work when ran from python manage . py shell?

Like the output of lspci and dmesg ? __label__2 Well, as you Matt57, my standards for OR a bit strict, as the recent discussion on the policy ' s talk page shows. Secondly, do you not find it interesting that Arrow only removes Muhammad (who is sourced), but does not remove Archimedes who is unsourced ? __label__2 that hotcat lockup, was like an edit conflict, so i tried a backup and re - enter. thanks for the assistance, i ' m using the old layout, so would the new view affect my hotcat category edits ? __label__2 Can you please give us some additional information on your hardware / setup? Do you have data that need rescue ? __label__2 @bobince I ' ve found several SVN software which one should I use? Can you point a link ? __label__2 @Noldorin: this [wikipedia page](http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Ansatz) will disagree with you.

K, I ' ve done a simplified version and stuck it on that page. Comments ? __label__2 Is the caption "Steelhead trout has been said to exist in Aliso Creek.." grammatically correct? Should it be "have been", referring to the trout as a group ? __label__2 Sorry, but an additional: if I do not export it to SD, where they originally are? Can I see them from PC ? __label__2 You mean pick an arbitrary point along the edge of a shape, then place 4 more points, each 1 / 5 of the total perimeter from the last? Or by points do you mean vertices ? __label__2 What are the specific queries you want to answer? Do you _really_ need to just list all user sessions, as your question implies, or are you after something else that could maybe be determined without exhaustively finding all sessions ? __label__2 I ' m a bit busy IRL, but I ' ve got a bit of time. What ' s up ? __label__2 Yeah, sorry, that ' s how I wrote it in the code but it was a mistake in my comment. Any idea why could this be caused?!__label__2 By changing ''Category : New Zealand Mu0101ori people'' to ''Category : New Zealand Mu0101ori rugby union team players'' for many Kiwi rugby players -- such as <url>, <url> and <url> etc -- you have removed many Mu0101ori people from the only category that collates them together.

Are you getting no hot water at all, or are you getting some, but it runs out quicker than it should ? __label__2 Is your desired result just the SQL statement with all the parameter placeholders substituted with their values? Or did you still want the `DECLARE` statements included, similar to the LINQPad output in my response ? __label__2 Err.. sorry for my ignorance, but.. what would be the point of this?

It seems a major task to do the whole lot - would it make sense simply to move the Catholics (say) out of the primate tree (by an edit) or is this bypassing the cfd process in some sneaky fashion ? __label__2 What is a List? an std::list ? __label__2 That depends; is the lemon there to help balance out the spice in a hot dish, or is it part of a recipe with the word "Lemon" in it ? __label__2 The short answer is no, there ' s no such thing as `static` in Ruby. Why not let the database handle your auto - incrementing key ? __label__2 There ' s a nice section on funerals <url> but I ' m not given a look at the contributors' page (p. 673) to see who J . B. is. Any chance your access is different ? __label__2 Thanks you! Please, Could you explain what are these options mean ? __label__2 Useful image indeed.

I don ' t think the DI Extension is being loaded. How can I check this ?__label__2 This question is a forum - style post, asking for multiple answers. Perhaps ask for the method that does the best job, or requires the least effort ? __label__2 Um. Could you remind me again tomorrow if I forget ? __label__2 It ' s unclear exactly what you want. Are you trying to rearrange the format string ? __label__2 The quality of your solution really depends on what you ' re doing in that foreach loop.

If so, are you keeping strong references to the view controllers ? __label__2 You ' ve amended the xdf article to say that it ' s not unique in having no upper case, but you ' ve mysteriously referred to the <url> article, which seems to have to do with Ghanaian mythology.

One book with a linked title and a short description of why it ' s recommended and what it ' s about per answer ? __label__2 Slightly underspecified: by 'arrange', you do mean place them in order at the start of the array? Any restrictions on what happens to the rest of the integers ? __label__2 So you ' re just looking to map the characters into another character? Sort of like a Ceaser Cipher ? __label__2 Are there any additional assumptions? E . g. O ( 1) size for the set of point - to nodes ? __label__2 You ' re asking very different questions here. One is a repeat: http://physics . stackexchange . com / questions / 1372 / is - rotational - motion - relative - to - space Could you simplify the question to ask just one thing, please ? __label__2 Which O / S? Are you asking how to write / architect the user - defined code, how to compile it, or how to load it after it ' s compiled ? __label__2 @Scott - The title really does look like it ' s a typo of "saddle sores".

Good heavens, on which platform ? __label__2 Do the stream auto - close when it is deallocated? If not, does it affect the battery life ? __label__2 PS. You mentioned 'typical issues'.

The changing size of the label ? __label__2 Were you able to find a solution to this, Jrutter? Perhaps upvote or select an answer as correct ? __label__2 Your POV tag justified. Did you get any support for cleaning it up ? __label__2 I ' m not sure your question makes sense. Do you mean, how do you measure the length of the red or blue lines ? __label__2 In my experience you cannot inherit from a class that derives from UserControl. Have you ever done it successfully ? __label__2 I ' m ambivalent as to whether it ' s ok to copy questions like that (even linking them).. shouldn ' t we wait for them to be asked organically? Or are you really interested in an answer ? __label__2 If you have archives to look through, can you double - check if this quote indeed comes from this article? Is it possible it came from another DeCurtis article in March titled "U2 releases The Joshua Tree"?__label__2 @Klark Why is the solution to the second example "not possible"? How about `(2 , 9) (5 , 1)`?__label__2 But it ' s not really suitable for its own article, either. Do you have a better place to merge it to ? __label__2 I still can ' t remember how I got into this. I remember there was an argument on the GameCube page but then there was nothing for a week or two..It hasn ' t been that long has it ? __label__2 This question seems nonsensical as focused beyond hyperfocal seems self - contradictory. Can you elaborate ? __label__2 @Michael, now think of the relationships between Cows and Herds, and between Cows and Cartoons. Are there any many - to - many relationships there ? __label__2 It ' s not that I don ' t like to use `memoir` commands -- it ' s that I don ' t know what they are in the first place. =) Could you please extend your answer to include the code which produces the same result but uses only `memoir` commands ? __label__2 What type of error?

How does it look to you ? __label__2  * Electrolysis* (in title) is often used to split water into H2 and O2--distinct from *generating electricity* (in text).

Are you looking for something that doesn ' t error out when the index doesn ' t exist ? __label__2 This looks like a bug. Do you see high numbers when the program is NOT marked "`Not Responding`"?__label__2 I don ' t understand exactly what the rules are. Are you only allowed to pick one number out of each row and only allowed to pick one number out of each column, and you have to pick 4 numbers, and you want the sum of these 4 numbers to be minimized ? __label__2 yeah what is a map hack and how is it different from other types of hacks? are they live editing files in their RAM or does this only work with custom homemade maps and custom games ? __label__2 Possibly an encoding issue? Do you see this in all browsers ? __label__2 I was thinking on it, but one question: I see several articles either deleted or promoted to FA after the oldid the sweeps uses.

Do you want to remove all of them, or just one at a time ? __label__2 I am not sure of the question.

As in: casually making false statements ? __label__2 What to do if I ' m newb?

Or do you only know that in the moment you need to fit it ? __label__2 It ' s very difficult to understand your problem if you don ' t provide the related code (HTML and maybe CSS in this case).

Is there something specific you ' re looking for that it doesn ' t do ? __label__2 I have a small problem. When I tell Swatch to find my user name it returns an error "There was a problem with the request: Status code = 500" Any ideas ? __label__2 Yes, it ' s a worry, particularly in light of the <url>. The end could be closer than we think .. or has someone else already said that ? __label__2 The first (slightly stupid ;) ) question that comes to my mind is, do you really need to run as root? Or just need root access to some other stuff that you could sudo to, or use setuid rights to ? __label__2 I have created a Neutral section for those who agree with the premise but not the method, or some other aspect, which may be altered following talkpage discussion.

How are you loading your scripts ? __label__2 Would it be acceptable to also note that all of the below are examples of somehow obscuring taking [deity]'s name in vain? One might say that 'holy smoke' (as an example of a veiled taking of a name in vain) would predate the Third Commandment ? __label__2 TimPF - I don ' t see the objectives as mutually exclusive, the previous creation of the Suburban Rail stubs by others took the content in a direction which I am reinforcing with these edits which fill out the stubs and bring a bit of consistency within the Suburban parts of RTIL. PRTIL could fulfill a similar function for mainline services perhaps ? __label__2 @Jaroslav: Sorry, I checked the linked page and didn ' t see anything obvious. Do you thing that replacing the $*$ with $\cdot$ would be ok ? __label__2 I see you added a <person> licence to the image but I don ' t see any evidence from the source provided that this licence is proper to the image. Where do you see that this is the correct copyright licence for the image ? __label__2 The question is a variation of the "which is best"-question to which the chat - room seems better suited. Can ' t we open a marketing - 101 - stackexchange on that ? __label__2 I can ' t seem to find anything online about a Motorola H20 headset. Is that definitely the model number ? __label__2 Are there any duplicate values? Do you know the range of values (i . e., 1 < x < 300)?__label__2 An issue has been raised at <url> about this article, which you created.

Have you tried debugging with different versions (3 and 4)?__label__2  ( 1) “Transitive closure” sounds as if you are looking for something like R∪R^2∪R^3∪…, but I guess that this is not the case and that you are looking for the H - representation of R^k for a given k.

Why don ' t you think it ' s optimal, or where have you gotten stuck ? __label__2 How are you running the Django? mod _ wsgi or mod _ python ? __label__2 If this is in production, I usually turn off all the error logging. Will the CI error handling log functions still work if I set the error reporting to none ? __label__2 Hi, the only reason I called it <url> is because there are similarly named streets in <url> and <url>, and the latter one has some notoreity.

Can you think of anything else that we need to tag that could be better handled through the comicsproj template than a banner on the front page ? __label__2 Please don ' t take this the wrong way, but this question doesn ' t really belong on http://wordpress . stackexchange . com/. Perhaps something like http://webmasters . stackexchange . com/ would be a better fit ? __label__2 @Mithun "*I must agree with you because there is a possibility that the asker may misunderstand the first phrase by insisting the context of what I explained for a situation where the context what you suggested would be needed*" - I asked this question without having any context at hand, I just happened to hear both phrases and wasn ' t sure if they meant the same thing.

More details ? __label__2 I ' m not really clear on what :foo _ bar is. Is it just a join table or does it have other properties that aren ' t listed ? __label__2 You are getting an output `" "`? (quotes containing a newline)?__label__2 The question implies that free software is good for programmers. I would prefer the question "Is free software good for programmers? Why?"__label__2 no but isn ' t it the correct named route for the index action? Isn ' t that the url that I want to pass to `.tokenInput()`?__label__2 Well it seems this is not a trivial question, but without too much thinking, why don ' t you create a linear vector of hue and saturation of 16 components? I mean 1 x 16 and show them a s cuadricule ? __label__2 Do you still feel there is a POV / NPOV dispute on the article? Do you feel mediation is still needed ? __label__2 Looks like homework.

I ' ll list all the images you have uploaded, you tell me where they came from, okay ? __label__2 So what kind of redirects ''would'' be appropriate in a print encyclopedia? The way you describe it, this would seem to be the default setting for all redirects, wouldn ' t it ? __label__2 Hey, I saw your continued edits to <url> and hoped you were a resident - since I was hoping to get a photograph of the Capitol Theatre in the city. Any chance ? __label__2 I tried to fix your problem with <url>. Is that what you were looking for ? __label__2 @user unknown, please edit that into your answer - I don ' t want any users to read or write unlike the other answer.

If not, how should differing weights be handled ? __label__2 That ' s an odd choice of name. Any particular reason for that ? __label__2 does not fit the criterium for quadratic convergence, as one would get &mu;=0; but it does not converge with a faster rate either.

Would this be too confusing for the user ? __label__2 Homework? What have you tried so far ? __label__2 What do you mean "There aren ' t any options to turn off the plugin"?

Might you consider mediation ? __label__2 what error do you receive? and when ? __label__2 That function doesn ' t compute the slope, which is why you ' re having the problem you are..

Or is it just me ? __label__2 Hi, I was wondering why it is that <url> only has two articles in it -- and whether it should be kept. Has it ever been more fully populated ? __label__2 Sorry Cla68, but I don ' t understand.

Can you explain what, exactly, the security department is there to protect ? __label__2 With `n \ k`, do you mean `n / k`, i . e. "n divided by k"?__label__2 Yes, that ' s right. What ' s in do _ search _ selected()?__label__2 You mention that it ' s fried at a high heat -- is it safe to assume that the tofu is coated in arrowroot, fried, then finished in the sauce ? __label__2 OK, I will do that. But probably we should first set the gallery up on commons - do you know anything about editing / creating there ? __label__2 With as many website / server / API driven apps are out there, you rarely don ' t want to upgrade. Could I ask why you don ' t want to upgrade, or why you want to preserve your current version ? __label__2 I ' ve heard about the controversy. What ' s your take on it ? __label__2 If your lists have more than 12 items, then collisions are inevitable, because there are more then 2**32 permutations of them. Or do your permutations have any particular properties which mean that there are fewer ? __label__2 Hi Taivo, I ' m beginning to have my suspicions that Fellowscientist might be you - know - who from past debates. Am I being paranoid ? __label__2 I would suggest you have a bug in your singleton code. Is there any reason you don ' t use a plain enum for your Singleton ? __label__2 The SNL encyclopedia article says "M / S Palatia", while my book source says it probably was a steamship (with a note saying that their sources differ). Do you have any more details on this ship ? __label__2 You and I got different totals for the NRHP sites in Middlesex County u2014 my number was 1300, gained by piling all the listings into a list and putting a # before each one, so the total number would display. Did you use a different calculation device ? __label__2 Hi Gzuckier. Any reason why single brackets need a nowiki tag (eg as on <url>)?__label__2 By "smooth," do you mean into a vector shape? Or do you want to keep the bitmap format and simply make it look nicer ? __label__2 Could you add a bit more context please? e . g. what R function and package are you using ? __label__2 Does it need to be public - key or just reversible? Can you give some kind of hint as to how the algorithm will be used ? __label__2 Do other people see your ads? Have you tried using a proxy ? __label__2 It would be trivial to do this in awk. Does that count as "doing it in bash"?__label__2 @Patric are you willing to share your implementation? And did you actually implemented them "word by word" from this particular book ? __label__2 I added an outside review to the article ' s Discussion page. Should this be put on the main article ? __label__2 I ' d recommend trying to understand _what_ it does prior to determining _how_ it does it. Did you get that far yet ? __label__2 @Dave I have updated my answer to include a link to a chart showing the missle bonus for the different shield sizes. Since you appear to have access to the manual, could you please confirm whether the information in the link is correct ? __label__2 Hello - I specifically asked for an image not to be deleted and asked once for it to be restored, but it seems someone asked you to go ahead and delete it again. Can you please restore <url> as I had it before ? __label__2 I read the article and can see where it already addresses some of his reliabilty issues. I guess that as long as it was clear that the quotes were from his autobiography and if any other info on the lack of collaboration (from the intro or foreword of the new edition of his autobiography) were included, I think it would be OK. Is there a lot of material to add that is only in his autobiography ? __label__2 @bbum - I ' m not using isKindOfClass in the code above. Would you care to share the "easy way"?__label__2 @robintw: I just noticed that you hadn ' t mentioned that your 3 numbers should be integers (although I, along with every one else, assumed that they were). Do they have to be integers ? __label__2 What exactly do you want to do? Display list of images or something else ? __label__2 PS so what is your Firefox advice? Is there a way to make it managable ? __label__2 As an outsider, I thought that the thrust of Floydian ' s edit was good, but it was a little terse in its wording (I ' ve been guilty of such overly terse writing myself). Rather than reverting with such an insulting edit, perhaps Coolcaeser could simply copyedit Floydian ' s text ? __label__2 I am more than happy to be overruled (and can reopen the question), but this discussion should take place on meta, not in this comment feed. Why don ' t you initiate a discussion there ?__label__2 What environment are you working in that is so limited? A shared server space ? __label__2 Isn ' t it not invisible? Why is the sky blue ? __label__2 A simulation in R with varying n1, n2, s1, s2, and population difference would make a nice exercise. Anyone ? __label__2 Which part is failing? Is it getting to the PHP code fine, or is the error occurring with how the PHP file is getting the data etc ? __label__2 I kind of agree with Lev Bishop, but I like the idea of offering a bounty for some specific improvement to some LaTeX documentation should be encouraged. Time for a new sister site for these kinds of offers ? __label__2 One deleteable article at a time, please. This is a <url> G4; do you agree, and if not, why not ? __label__2 Referring to the Nomination for Deletion <url>, you suggest that Bill4Time be "mentioned" under List of Legal Software. Would that enable the Bill4Time Wikipedia page to still exist ? __label__2 To answer that we need to know what you want to do with it. What are your goals ? __label__2 Mikael: so it ' s editor issue? i should change mode in kwrite or something ? __label__2 Is it referring to a different bank of a similar name? What source is it from ? __label__2 Got terrible ratings at my RfA. Other than that, I ' m just trying to get over 100 edits this month.. You ? __label__2 It appears the question posted to your comment <url> was not answered. Out of curiosity, where is the correct place ? __label__2 Ah! Who said that Wikipedia administrators were not romantics ? __label__2 What do you think is wrong with using a hidden form field? What do you want to achieve on a higher level ? __label__2 M, I think we should put back the section that was archived yesterday. What do you think ? __label__2 What kind of routing logic would you provide at the host - level? Are you talking about routing to various servers in a pool, or using something like IP source - routing ? __label__2 Are we talking about some specific language (C, asm)? Does the machine have FPU or does it only operate on integer registers ? __label__2 Anil, most people here are probably more comfort with US $ prices. Can you translate ? __label__2 Backreference should be in the format (?<link>.*) and not (?<link>.*?)__label__2 i cant use 6x3 as there are 600 x 300 possible points. I suppose the better question is what could I apply to show that it scaled properly ? __label__2 Very well. However, since the cartoon and Fleewtay version ''don ' t'' have an article, perhaps they should be mentioned on this page or given articles of their own ? __label__2 This is interesting. Have you tried calling them and asking wherefor art thou WSDL ? __label__2 When you said "we ' re RBIing" I assumed you were associating your edits with those of TenOfAllTrades. Were you associating your edits with those of someone else, or do you use the plural pronoun ? __label__2 Also, are all of those examples supposed to be sent through the subject line? Furthermore, what happens if I include something in the message body ? __label__2 I changed statistical - bias to unbiased - estimator. Does that work ? __label__2 There might be another action in your MSI triggering ScheduleReboot. Have you tried searching for it using Orca ? __label__2 Since this came up in another question, is there a UK equivalent for what we in the US call "biscuits"? The Cookies -> Biscuits correlation is listed above, but what about Biscuits -> ??__label__2 Replied on my talk. BTW, do you have access to the paid NYT articles or any of the paid newspaper archives ? __label__2 Which language are you using to solve this? Can you show some code ? __label__2 **Hey!** I just had the greatest idea - when a user clicks on a question in the widget, why not redirect them to the appropriate page on http://StackMobile . com ?__label__2 If both have access to the same save files then you will be fine as long as you ' re not running two copies of Dwarf Fortress at the same time. But what do you mean by running from the same source ? __label__2 Hey, when do we add games for the EHF Champion League and the Basketball EuroLeague into the portal? And NFL every week ? __label__2 Okay, I read through it (skimmed through some parts as they are largely repetitive). I think maybe a good place to bring this up would be in <url>?__label__2 Then it is indeed very strange why this should be influenced by changes to the Cygwin installation, they should be entirely unrelated. Have you added Cygwin ' s bin folder to cmd ' s %PATH% setting ? __label__2 You need to be more specific on the clustering. If p1 - p2 < d, and p2 - p3 < d, but p1 - p3 > d, do you still cluster p1 , p2 , p3 together ? __label__2 homework? what have you thought of so far ? __label__2 I rather got on my high - horse at <url>. Perhaps you can take a peek and tell me if my intuition has gone astray in this case of interpretation of <url>?__label__2 Well, that was an example as I am adding Infobox Historical American Political Party infobox to all those historical parties in <url> for which I was previously using the regular Infobox American Political Party until I found the Historical version in <url>. So if I wish to continue, I will have to assign colors and shortname to all of them if not already done (like Anti - Masonic Party) right ? __label__2 I added one. Does it look alright ? __label__2 Delete away; the SVG ' s done :) How would you like it licensed? PD ? __label__2 That makes me wonder what algorithm inbuilt tablediff utility uses ? Anyone ?__label__2 Any errors? what is in the debug console ? __label__2 How did you install mysql? How do you call the script ? __label__2 I don ' t understand. How can anything be more than 100% opaque ? __label__2 What comes up to me , do the images come from exactly the *same* domain as the the application? Or a different domain ? __label__2 Do you know any of your classmates? Maybe ask one of them? :)__label__2 For some reason, <url> states to notify people on the talk page. I think the idea is to avoid self - references for the reader, but then the clean - up tags already alert the reader to other things, so this seems OK. Do you want to ask about using this at <url>?__label__2 why was I down voted for this? Is it not a valid question ? __label__2 Uhm, can you clarify? Are you asking how to count how many "a"'s an array has ? __label__2 Also, does the structure of the tree change at all as your computation proceeds, or is it static? Is the amount of work done at each node the same, or vary in a predictable way ? __label__2 I would like to move the section <url> from <url> to <url>. Comments ? __label__2 You know it to be O ( log n)? Or your hope? :P__label__2 @Henk Holterman, I knew someone would tell me this. But what else can I do ? __label__2 The code above is in application . js and it does manage to create a unique `new _ id` each time it runs. But, how can I then access this unique number from inside the view ? __label__2 That sounds like they are just "general use" of the word, so in each article delink and (if needed) explain that, in this context, diaphragm means a divider - or just rewrite without the word diaphragm, or use a link to wiktionary. In fact, should linking to wiktionary be a standard way to clear up some of the links to dab pages ? __label__2 Stu: I have this terrible pain whenever I twist my arm around this way. What should I do ? __label__2 Btw, I realized that it is not clear from your question that you ' re asking about *your own* passwords, for other services, stored on your desktop (or laptop, or whatever) - as opposed to an application / service storing passwords for all registered users. Can you put that clarification in the question (assuming I understood correctly)?__label__2 @ROM1 - Yes I can implement HTTP. Is there any solution for HTTP ? __label__2 There are a lot of ways to ensure thread safety without using a threading API. What operating systems and cpu architectures are you planning on supporting ? __label__2 Your signature currently seems to be turning into question marks (your previous signatures are still cyrillic). Is this deliberate ? __label__2 I see where the calligraphy portion of some of my illustrations has been removed in a couple of articles ( see: <url>). Is there a particular reason for that ? __label__2 I had a quick scan through the <url> article, which while good seems to be to suffer from the negative effects of "summary style" when used on very large topics - namely that while the individual sections are good summaries of what they are describing, the ''overall'' article lacks a coherent flow, a narrative taking the reader from beginning to end. Does that make sense ? __label__2 So I think it ' s better research one by one and decide which one is common name (use). What is your opinion ?__label__2 Ah, sorry, my mistake. However, at least on Snow Leopard, it ' s RunAtLoad, not RunAtLaunch -- or am I making the next mistake here? :-)__label__2 Please givez me the codez? What have you tried so far ? __label__2 Are you using a the native home screen or a home screen / launcher replacement? On the blank screen can you add new icons and widgets ? __label__2 1 ) Is |S| the number of edges after removing the leaves of the DFS tree or the original random graph? 2) By matching you mean the maximum matching or any matching is ok ? __label__2 Hello. Was wondering where you got his Birmingham squad number from ? __label__2 Can edge weights be negitive? Can there be negitive weight cycles ? __label__2 Was <url> by the user correct? It is supposed to be a redirect, is it not ? __label__2 @Steven: Sorry, don ' t follow. Can you elaborate ? __label__2 Sure, show me the glossary of terms link. Also should the link be at the bottom vs the top, or perhaps not at all and instead be something linked - to from the main article of <url> ?__label__2 I personally haven ' t really ran in to any fascists here, but I very much doubt that anyone would object to redirects. Could you tell me the location of the list ? __label__2 What can you tell us about the keys (e . g. are they consecutive)?__label__2 Kolmogorov test is for distributions hence object lying in infinite dimensional space.. not obvious to get asymptotic power=1. t - test is about testing the mean of a real valued random variable ? __label__2 Which version of Erlang are you running? Can you try your example after running `application : start ( sasl).` in your Erlang shell ? __label__2 Hi. How are you doing today, Haunted Angel ? __label__2 Loading it into a frame also seems to work for me: http://testing . subdmedia . com / loadinggifframe . html. Can you post the full code for the iframe as well as well as the content, or better yet, a link to your test ? __label__2 I am having trouble finding evidence of Wacu0142awowo in Avondale. There don ' t appear to be any sources; is it possible that the spelling is off ? __label__2 @user Could you please be more specific? Exactly how does Arc 9 . x fail ? __label__2 What is the problem? Does the timer continue to count down ? __label__2 As a timid Wikipedia end - user who never makes more than a rare grammatical or spelling edit, learning the history to be found on this talk page and Kate ' s userpage history makes me sad. Why is it that so many communities change the way they do as the size of the project they revolve around increases..?__label__2 I can ' t tell how you get 216 for 99. And by 'denary' do you mean 'decimal' perhaps ? __label__2 A user bar is not specific to WordPress, it ' s a HTML element with some links, the bar here for example is actually just an element sat inside the header, with a background that gives the impression of a bar ( nothing spectacular). Do you want an example of how to create a div with some links in it ? __label__2 BTW, as a complete aside, I have wondered for years why Enver Bey / Pasha is at <url>. What do you think ? __label__2 Perhaps if you are making a presentation about different possible equations, and wanted to use the bullets to indicate that they aren ' t equations meant to be satisfied simultaneously? (That is, using the itemize environment as formatting to communicate something like logical disjunction?)__label__2 I didn ' t test it, but does it properly remove the following comment: `--[==[ text ]==] more text ]==]`? And does it _not_ remove parts of the following code: `a='--[[' ; b=']]'`?__label__2 is there another transparent view in front of the right 1 / 3? Or maybe your button has been moved outside of it ' s parent view ' s bounds ? __label__2 If that ' s really your code.. looks like you ' re going to end up with a ton of HTML UL elements with the same ID of 'day'. Does your real code actually output one UL with multiple LI children ? __label__2 How is myIntersections used? Do the elements point to doubles in another vector ? __label__2 sorry, inserted before I was through. A vague source said that the usage of this in the sense of 'appropriate' is relatively new and I wondered if anyone could pinpoint the diverting point ? __label__2 A very excellent question. As a corrolary question, how do you taste your seasoning on a hot dish / sauce without burning your tongue ? __label__2 You ask 'how much quicker'. In what unit of measure, exactly, do you want the answer to be in ? __label__2 Also, you state that 2^|rules| is too many computational steps. What about |options in group 1| * |options in group 2| .. * |options in group k|?__label__2 Please name the browser and version. Are you sure this is a WordPress related problem ? __label__2 PCB = Printed Circuit Board? As opposed to mechanical parts ? __label__2 Um. Thanks ? __label__2 Whatever works. I trust that you ' ll do what ya gotta do, right ? __label__2 A _very_ rough (but easy) solution would be to strip _all_ non - ASCII characters from the input. Would that work for you ? __label__2 This article was recently submitted for <url> but it appears to be missing a reference to "James". Could you fix that please ? __label__2 @Tyler Eaves How can this be done? What tools do you use ? __label__2 not sure I agree with your premise, most of the open source raster software I ' m familiar with stores data in files directly. Are their specific features of Image Server you ' re interested in ? __label__2 Hey there. Do you mind if the Wells and Mendip Museum DYK you nominated ends up in the list of DYKs <url>, or would you rather it run sooner ? __label__2 When you say "`buf` is a string", do you mean it ' s already a `char*`? And you ' re casting its address to type `const char*`?__label__2 I was thinking based on an assumption which is "there should always be something in common in each pc" and if this comon thing is made up by bunch of transistors and if this common thing is able to process an operation, its processing performance can be in relation to 'transistors count' Stupid approach? (So I was asking, what is this common possible process AND how can I measure its performance ? )__label__2 If your images are smaller than your threshold, why do you need to run them through ImageMagick with that parameter? Why not just convert them over, or do you require all images to be that exact size ? __label__2 As for <url> and your note u201cSo there are certainly good strong sources for that usage, although I have not the slightest doubt that you can also find some utterly - respectable sources that use "attorney generals.", the explanation might be that the persons in question are semantically not attorneys but generals designates (attorney generals). Any further thought ? __label__2 According to the docs, it ' s not "one big polygon," but has already been "divided into 100km x 100km squares." Do you need to *clip* out smaller portions of those square features or would it suffice to *select* those squares covering your study region ? __label__2 Ouch - sorry! But once I arrived at music, Genesis wasn ' t that far from genius - does that count ? __label__2 @Joseph: Great answer. Could you please expand a bit on the `m+g`?__label__2 I tried that..still no use. Is the code I posted in the end better then others ?__label__2 Hi, I see that you agree that User : Dr Joe ' s edits are suspicious.. his latest edit totally clinches it though, as he went to the article <url> and reverted my changes on it, exactly like Beckjord did one or twice in the past out of nowhere, and then made edit comments on his talk page and talk : Bigfoot about how "my" mythology article sucks and needs to be opposed. I was wondering if you could go undo his edit for me there ? __label__2 Actually, I think the only problem with linking the characters like this is that the underlining can be kind of distracting and the page can get a little harder to edit. I wonder if there is some way to modify the Wikipedia software so that Chinese characters would automatically link to their corresponding Wiktionary page ? __label__2 Hi Carnildo, I ' ve just noticed the <url> stopped working last week. Could you advise whether it ' s going to be restarted, or whether I should manually remove red links from articles for the last week ? __label__2 I don ' t think that an hour is long enough to actually break down all of the collagen, especially if you don ' t chop the bones. Does your stock turn to a jelly - like consistency when it cools ? __label__2 I find it done both ways on the web. If some convention requires capitalizing it even though it ' s not anything like a proper noun, I think that should get explained in the article, otherwise reasonable people will wonder who it ' s named after: someone named Saros, but what ' s his first name and where ' s the Wikipedia article about him ? __label__2 Hey Mvjs, I was wondering if you could prove me somewhat sane. Has the tab at the top of the page changed from 'discussion' to 'talk'?__label__2 How do you want to handle this? - <person> (which will take about a week), or should one of us just create the new category and transfer the articles, then you can <person> the old one ? __label__2 I have variation of this problem: How do I make instruments stop at certain point? is there some option to make it stop when UIA script finishes ? __label__2 I noticed your interest in Dirichlet ' s contribution to the problem of <url>. Do you have any information about what Dirichlet did exactly here ? __label__2 What browsers does it not work in? Have you tried IE / FF / Chrome ? __label__2 Should we understand the outermost pair of curly braces `{}` to be a reference to a Perl hash? Are you just asking how best to format a lengthy hash in Perl ? __label__2 Thanks - does it actually make any difference in the rendered article whether <person> or <person> is used to link for a category? Obviously the latter allows easier entry (one less parameter) but I can ' t see that it makes any functional difference, once the template processes the parameters ? __label__2 @stOle - Your solution needs more explanation as in how the two problems are the same. Are you able to reduce one problem to the other ? __label__2 Is it timing out, or getting a 500 error? Have you enabled all error reporting in your php . ini as well ? __label__2 Do you need it to be zero? Can you assign it the **real** value immediately instead ? __label__2 You have already mentioned multiple imputation, the answer I ' m thinking about. Why don ' t you use draws from truncated distributions ? __label__2 What do you remember from gameplay? Something particular ? __label__2 I love "official journalistic decision". Do journalists make the rules ? __label__2 Can you give a more precise question to adapt my answer? What you want to do exactly with your text ?__label__2 @Federico : This part defines a schema in the wsdl. Does it import one or defines it there ? __label__2 I ' m going to try and hurry the <url> article through both GA and FA to see if I can get it as the Featured Article on the Main Page in time for its 20 - year anniversary on October 18, 2009. Care to help a little or a lot ? __label__2 I don ' t understand. Isn ' t bounding box just a box containing all of your rectangles ? __label__2 And then people could not edit it, and my signature will become very long. Plus I think the loading is negligible, comparing people with SVG flags in their signature.. What do you think ? __label__2 Your specs do not have span adjustment. Is there a typo ? __label__2 And also .. what was the _starting_ temp. Was the food cold, or ambient temp when you started reheating ? __label__2 I see <url> some <person> tags to the <url> page. Is there something in particular you feel needs citation, or did the article just look generally reference - sparse ? __label__2 The browser should take care of caching. Perhaps you have yours set to not keep a cache ? __label__2 <url> wasn ' t me. Could you possibly go back and correct the AN / I thread ? __label__2 What ' s the actual error code? Do you have many small files or few big files in there ? __label__2 I added two marks (A and B). When you say `GOTO EXECUTE method _ two()`, to which mark do you want to go ? __label__2 JQuery has many lightbox implementation. have you thought about scraping the proto lightbox and porting to a jquery based one ? __label__2 Is the required .net framework installed? Does your code have any static initializers that can throw ? __label__2 I have your CH2 . js installed, but I forgot what it does. What does it do ? __label__2 You need to further explain the problem you are trying to solve, please. This sounds like a homework problem of some kind ? __label__2 Please be more specific. Do you want to connect a device to your xperia and have the audio routed thru the loudspeaker ? __label__2 Your image is 8 bits per pixel with 3 channels? Did you mean 24 bits per pixel, since that ' s what the RGB masks you specified seems to suggest ? __label__2 So you just want to get "any" element from a set? Or you want to check "if a given value is inside the set"?__label__2 What exactly do you mean by "HTML encode"? Can you give an example input and the desired output ? __label__2 Good, I ' m confused with the special terminology. Could you please simplify the terminology (or even better remove it)?__label__2 I vote that they stay, given that even though they ' re not "Recurring" in and of themselves, they ' re part of a recurring phenomenon, which is Stephen doing "Better Know a District" spin - offs. So, maybe we should re - group them under a heading of "Spin - Offs" in the "BKaD" section ? __label__2 On a related note: Some providers offer (for an extra free) "privacy protected domain registration". What does that mean ? __label__2 @skywaddler. Sorry, but I got to ask for clarification: In your terminology, do you distinguish between a _function_ and a _functional_ ?__label__2 When the breakpoint 'activates' is the `struct frame` in scope? Do you have more variables named `Frame`, possibly static to another translation unit or local to some function .. ?__label__2 Hey, I saw you ' re comments on conman33 talk page. Have you met LJ ? __label__2 Replied there. Should we keep it in that one place for now ? __label__2 please make us clear what do you mean by start menu bar. Is it the menu / icons on panel ?__label__2 Quick question. In your opinion would the Dromore by election meet notability ? __label__2 what do you mean by lock? you can ' t click on lock icon and enter your password to unlock it ? __label__2 Just in case you haven ' t seen it. I wondered if you might even respond to the comments there ? __label__2 I strongly agree with deleting poorly sourced articles, articles about people in the news enjoying their 15 minutes of fame, memorials, articles merely linking to the subjects website, articles about internet phenomena which are sourced onlyu to blogs or fansites. We are in accord on many things, but I have one question: On your user page you say "The name of my dog is not "human knowledge"-it ' s unverifiable ." Shouldn ' t you have quotes around "Unverifiable," if that ' s what you call your dog ? __label__2 Why are you building gcc & co. Wouldn ' t it be better to use it from system repositories ? __label__2 There have been no comments for over two weeks at <url>. Do you think it might be time to make one more post on the math and physics talk pages and then edit the header to say consensus has been reached ? __label__2 Thanks but I didn ' t quite understand the response. Could you please elaborate on it ? __label__2 But why is it the noscript element on the same level with 'head' and 'body' in the first place? What is the DOCTYPE of the html ? __label__2 It might help to know what language ( s) you are using. Also , it ' s a bit obvious but: you _have_ checked that the DLL in question is being built with debug information and that your deploy / publish process uses the debug version of that DLL ? __label__2 so i partially understand. I took out version jquery version 1 . 3 . 2., but how do I update jquery version 1 . 4 . 2 so it works with the fading images function ? __label__2 You give us some setup, but you don ' t explain what the problem is. Can you go into more detail about what ' s actually wrong or not working ? __label__2 Kim, since you ' re the uninvolved admin here, can you just block this <url>? Or do I have to report him to ANI ? __label__2 And another question about the question: What about the first people that are born, in particular the very first person, who are their parents? Do we just ignore that, and allow that each person has 0 , 1, or 2 parents ? __label__2 Can you clarify the question a bit? Do you want to simply get the third element from the list (which in this case is the list of lists) or do you want to find the element which is a list of lists (without knowing at which position it will be)?__label__2 Is it running debug mode? Is Visual Studio attached to the web server ? __label__2 Ok, thanks. So ok to archive the RFI then ? __label__2 Sounds like a good plan. Do you think DRYLOK is a good or bad thing to do on the walls ? __label__2  " 1 to over 200" - what ' s the actual upper bound? and how big are the cards, normal playing card size ? __label__2 What method is giving you the ArrayIndexOutOfBounds? Can you print a stack trace ? __label__2 Do all the points make up a single pattern? Or are you looking for multiple patterns in the same list of points ? __label__2 I am doing stub cleaning and consolidation that is needed to reduce the incidence of tiny articles. For instance, did you know that the Luis Rodriguez article was linked to by a music producer, two boxers and a singer ? __label__2 probably is recessed lighting. is this the style of lighting you are referring to http://ww . google . com / images ? q=recessed % 20lighting & safe=on & um=1 & ie=UTF - 8 & source=og & sa=N & hl=en & tab=wi & biw=1408 & bih=800 ?__label__2 Can you please explain that arg() system in drupal, how it does work? Or where i can read about it ? __label__2 How do I "inform a Wikiproject"? I would have liked to do so in several articles, but is this not <url>?__label__2 thanks. Please, can you rephrase your question as answers to each specific subquestion ? __label__2 Can you review your <url>?

A fire needs an ignition source, and the only thing I know of that can actually ignite from microwaves is metal. Was there a metal twist tie or something ? __label__2 as far as I can remember Eclipse can generate the WSDL.

For example: `'/dosomething arg1 arg2'` ?__label__2 Try to serialize the FormData instance and compare the XML output with the XML you are trying to deserialize. Are there any differences ? __label__2 @RHPT, that completely changes things, so please edit it into the original question. If this project is a success, is it likely to change Schuyler ' s opinion of its importance ? __label__2 Found some more information which likely explains it: http://rt . openssl . org / Ticket / Display . html ? id=1497 & user=guest & pass=guest -- still not sure how I can work around it.

Don ' t get me wrong though, i ' d be curious to see some examples myself in anticipation of 3 . 1.. (i tend to use the stable branch as i spend more time supporting whatever the majority of users are on).. (or is this in 3 . 0 . 2?)__label__2 What does the template end up rendering like as HTML? Does it use display inline HTML5 style, or as an object, or is it referenced from an image tag ? __label__2 I don ' t understand what you mean. When you use an array where exactly to compare what ? __label__2 @Andras: Sure, but that ' s not really related to the expansion properties.

In that case I ' m going to tag it for deletion as a redundant redirect, if that ' s okay with you ? __label__2 You said in Terrorism : Talk that a user can be blocked from a particular article. How could you block all the sockpuppets of that user ?__label__2 So what do you think they want, anyway? I mean does this boil down to the words ''murder'' and ''kidnapping'' along with ''Brigham did it cuz he looked like a duck and quacked like a duck'' or what ? __label__2 Well glad that you didn ' t have to send anything back. I wonder how many "backfocus" lenses end up occuring due to human error ? __label__2 You would be changing the semantics of the underlying language if you could do that - not usually a good idea.

If not, exactly how are you calling the code from the JSP ? __label__2 what kind of encryption you want? symmetric or not ? __label__2 How many 1600x1200 images are you talking about? Are you asking how to speed up the internet ? __label__2 The default zoom would show the whole image filling all of the available space in the control. Are you asking then how to center either the vertical or the horizontal when the image aspect doesn ' t match the controls aspect ? __label__2 @FrustratedWithFormsDesigner: if it depends on the function, then the answer to the question is "no".

Do you see any output ? __label__2 So it would seem that the ideas underpinning the law of conservation of mass existed at the time (if not previously), Lavoisier and others were formulating the principle, it did not become a verified "law" until the nineteenth century, which subsequently was qualified in the twentieth century. Is that about right ? __label__2 @Mark C This question could hardly have been answered accurately in a high school text. Perhaps it asked about two adjoining nodes ? __label__2 Bob, Have now actioned the above. Are there any further railway references that you consider weak or missing ? __label__2 Thanks.. but can you tell me how to promote only 200 nodes ? __label__2 @peterjwest if that is a room and you use rectangles for collision detection you ' ll get a lot of false positives. Or am I missing something ? __label__2 UIImage *chevronImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"chevron"]; Do you try to add in the image extension in your code ? __label__2 That is actually quite a fair percentage, less than sixty six point six percent approval and the tool is not continued.

Did you also download the .js file ?__label__2 I see that he just re - added the old article in there at first, but by the time we got to the end, it was significantly changed.

Can you post a closeup photo of your rear cog and dropout ? __label__2 The "another set of numbers" is unordered? With no duplicates (since it is a set)?__label__2 I think there is probably a very useful question underneath this, but as it stands this is quite subjective; some individuals may worry more about one or the other (or both) but that might not be useful for you at the end of the day. Can you reword the question more towards specifics ? __label__2 How is suffix tree represented in practice? could we represent it using adjacency list as in graph ? __label__2 Have a look at the changes. Do you think they will break anything ? __label__2 What just happened? Is this recent or the stuff that happened a few days ago ? __label__2 And while I ' m on templates, I spotted <url>.

Do you have any more comments and can you be persuaded to change your vote ? __label__2 Javascript running in a browser doesn ' t have access to the underlying file system for security reasons, but this could be accomplished if you ' re talking about server - side JS (such as node . js). Are you? :)__label__2 Find the shortest path. If there are other paths of the same distance, find those as well ? __label__2 Hi, it looks as if SVG images in taxoboxes are not counted when producing the list of tree of life articles without images. Is that intended ?__label__2 I have created a Neutral section for those who agree with the premise but not the method, or some other aspect, which may be altered following talkpage discussion.

Can you please remove it for me per <url>?__label__2 Sorry for the confusion, I just updated the question to specify a total of 60 characters or less, but it ' s a great code snippet.

('importdata'?)__label__2 The meta topic you linked to is about Alcohol. What does that have to do with Lemonade ? __label__2 Hi there.

Could you please expand on your question a little bit ? __label__2 I don ' t think you can. What is it you need to do ? __label__2 Your problem is a little ambiguous. Could you provide sample output with the related database records ? __label__2 One thing I noticed though is that the letter rows ("0 - 9", "A", etc) look a bit strange when the table is sorted using a non - alphabetic criteria.

Feedback ? __label__2 What is an activity node graph? What is an event node graph ? __label__2 @Gareth - No answers yet. Perhaps you can publicize this question by linking to it on randonneuring / audax forums ? __label__2 I don ' t see any problem. What is not working ? __label__2 It looks like you get either wrong character widths or kerning values. Did you try disabling the kerning altogether to check if you get correct character widths this way ? __label__2 What Android version are you running? Froyo 2 . 2 already has wireless tethering so that should do it for you otherwise can you upgrade to 2 . 2 ? __label__2 I remember your commenting on this about seven years ago.

Word your question imperfectly and expect it to be closed mercilessly ? __label__2 I tried to make sense of the CfD rules and procedures as I think this: <url> has no reason to exist, but I decided instead to just bug the first person on the CfD discussions who seemed to know what they are doing, so I come to you. Could you properly nominate this for deletion ? __label__2 Could you, please, point us to a correct calculation? .. in "as if" case ? __label__2 I spotted a comment you made at the Help Desk discussion page: "I ' m in the process of sweeping Wikipedia of links to all its question answering departments, and replacing them with a single link in each location to route all questions traffic through an upgraded Wikipedia : Questions page." Do you mind me asking how you "sweep" Wikipedia of all those links? How do you find them all ? __label__2 Where are the actual findings of fact and sanctions in Haiduc ' s case?

What is the typical (and maximum) size of list B ? __label__2 How did you deploy it? Maybe you are missing essential .NET framework ? __label__2 Now as a sign of good faith on my part, I choose to recuse my "overturn" decision on the HHO deletion review. What is the proper wikipedia procedure for this ? __label__2 That machine only cooks the crepes on one side. Wouldn ' t they stick together in the 'Finished' tray ? __label__2 In your vote against my candidacy you stated that you were a "weak oppose".

Did you ask him / her to redact or remove it ? __label__2 I ' ve tried re - updating many times but it just won ' t edit my <url> page or <url> page.

Do you mean it no longer appears as a shortcut icon on the home screen ? __label__2 @rinogo: most programs I ' ve ever written to process XML would throw an exception on malformed XML.

Do you have a different definition ? __label__2 Hi, do you have a nationality for ''Belpamela''? If so, would you add the relevant flag ? __label__2 Another thing: <url> has created <url>.

In any case, what have you considered so far ? __label__2 Assuming I don ' t have a masterlink, I assume I ' d need to use a chain tool. (One of my multitools has one, I think.) Does pushing a pin out weaken the chain, or am I worried over nothing ? __label__2 News coverage would be spotty at best.. you would have to go through the stats pages and do it by hand pretty much, so any of the Calgary / Edmonton Sun, Herald or Journal would suffice.

As well, since the linguistic divisions of Iranian are not really disputed, can you give me a source that has these languages as Persian dialects ? __label__2 The problem statement is, unfortunately, not clear at all.

"Free / Open - Source Theme Frameworks as an Alternate to Thesis?"__label__2 He ' s already been blocked, as far as I can tell.

Any chance you could roll back the deletion, so I could add some text on why this is notable ? __label__2 @mathpasha I am not sure, if you are looking to typeset, big integers or large sized numbers as in font - size. Can you please clarify ? __label__2 When / how do these links get loaded? Try $('.button').live('click') instead, does that work ? __label__2 Hi, I noticed on <url> you mentioned its Alexa traffic rank. How do you find out the Alexa traffic rank of something ? __label__2 Thanks, I ' ve PNG - ised these, and they look quite a lot better (to me, anyway!) &mdash; "cbc decryption . png" was missing; I don ' t suppose that ' s easily available, for completeness ? __label__2 I have to know; has this got you worried about the quality of GeoNames? If I pick one of the ones that is only accurate to the arc minute, will it be worse ? __label__2 A good way to see if a question is off topic.

Is there a reason to set the width and height manually ? __label__2 I think `iter . toList . sortBy(_.myAttr).take ( n)` is simple and efficient enough when the size of the iterator is close to `n`. Are you thinking that `n` will always be small and dealing with possibly large iterators ? __label__2 What are you protecting, exactly? You ' re worried your OS X install is attacked ? __label__2 is extending pdo a bad thing? I had an independent mysqli class before but I was told better off extending mysqli so I thought it must be the same as pdo??__label__2 I ' m getting a little nervous that the FAC ' s not attracting much attention. You know FAC much better than I do, should I be worried yet ? __label__2 corel draw will export dxf. Do you have the program ? __label__2 @Brian - You ' re right, this should be in meta. Would you be willing to start the thread ? __label__2 I ' ve also got this problem, rebooting or cleaning does not help. Did you get to the bottom of this ? __label__2 Also, how does that vandalism thing on your page work? Do you have to change the count manually, or does it detect vandalism itself ? __label__2 <url> is basically ready for FAC pending some copy edits. Could you take a look to see if anything additional needs to be done ? __label__2 You are obviously very busy. How should I proceed ? __label__2 I am a bit confused. In the title you ask for a solution without locks and in the question you do want locking ? __label__2 I see. This would explain No 1, what about 2 - 5 ? __label__2 What do you think? How did you arrive at your answer ? __label__2 Sorry I ' m still not clear, the movies are not just different between cinemas, the movies change too. If one cinema starts playing a new interesting movie while the others haven ' t, this one cinema may have bigger change in gaming sales, no ? __label__2 If pin C0 floats HIGH and C1 is connected to AREF which is also HIGH, then there shouldn ' t be any change.

Did you receive it ? __label__2 This happens when the system can ' t start another X server with the second (new) user - it disappears and goes back to your (locked) screen. Can you post up your graphics drivers' configuration and the hardware specs ? __label__2 This page is new, the result of a move - the page it moved from is now a redirect to <url>, but the history which goes with it is at the page I asked to be deleted. Can you delete the page, while copying the history over to the article ? __label__2 <url> seems does not exist.

What is the radius in this case ? __label__2 @nikic, its a WordPress site on HostGator. How can I tell ? __label__2 Actually it ' s probably a structure. I bet you declared `struct mystruct { int something; }` and then tried `struct mystruct myobj` followed by a `myobj->something` when you meant `myobj . something`, right ? __label__2 perhaps a stupid question, but you don ' t have some bogus character in your .py file after "unittest"?

Btw, how is your name pronounced ? __label__2 I have a question.

Is there a section I ' m misreading ? __label__2  " I ' ve tried replacing butter with yoghurt in all of these and the results ere OK." - Didn ' t you just answer your own question ? __label__2 may I suggest that you give different names (`\fooa`, `\foob` etc would be okay) to the different version of `\foo`, so that it ' s easier to refer to them?

S. food or cookies ? __label__2 By average time difference, do you mean the mean of the difference for every record? That is, `Sum ( table1 . timestamp - table2 . timestamp) / n`, where table1 . id = table2 . id and `n` is the number of rows common two both tables (eg n=count ( table1 . id = table2 . id))?__label__2 So your goal, as stated above, is not complete? You have stated the goal for row A, but then you also have goals for the other rows ? __label__2 Sounds like a projection issue.

I ' d love to learn xyz.. but I do my real work in [current language])?__label__2 The navigation popups will not appear on certain pages in the Wikipedia namespace. Is this a bug ? __label__2 I see! By the way, this doesn ' t seem to make sense: "Simon was hired as a writer, becoming showrunner by the age of 23." Simon must have been 23 in 1978, so either the birth date is wrong or he ' s lying about his age ? __label__2 It ' s cool (<url>), but the high resolution vs. seems to be different, see <url>. Hmm why ? __label__2 In the browsers I ' ve tested (Chrome, Firefox and Epiphany on GTK under Linux) the rich text edit area automatically resizes to the size of the window.

Or what about some kind of struct wrapper and functions to manipulate it ? __label__2 A wikipedia project that serves as a place where users can get signatures, userboxes.. stuff like that, so they don ' t have to make it themselves or ask a specific user to do it.

I assume the sources are not OR ? __label__2 You were asking for a source for the <url> mention of the <url> service to Lagos from March 29th, which you reverted. Would <url> do ? __label__2 I don ' t thing there ' s ready made solution to that. Maybe some machine learning algorithms ? __label__2 Sorry to bother you again, but you changed your comment to "keep" ? I don ' t really understand, i thought you agreed with me..?__label__2 @Isaac More basic ops doesn ' t mean less programming effort.

Why is it better to relink it like this: <url>?__label__2 It seems to me that the constraints may be arbitrary and affect an arbitrary number of other options in an arbitrary number of groups. So it ' s the arbitrary constraints that give you difficulty here ? __label__2 Hm, I was unaware of said threads. Would you mind providing me with a link ? __label__2 Like the data dumps? Or does it need to be current ? __label__2 Ok, would you mind if I created a UK specific category and shoved all the UK articles into there? I would suggest renaming the US category, and putting them both (and other countries) into 'Railway Companies' or similar ? __label__2 I ' d really like to know how to do this without a data plan. An SMS autoresponder that replies with a google maps link to my latitude and longitude ? __label__2 Can you expand upon "my app screws up?".

In fact that ' s even stranger, how did I manage to make a multi - hour edit without getting hit during the vandal ' s attack ? __label__2 I have no idea how to explain that succinctly, though I ' ll probably write a couple of articles on the whole mess soon. Any idea how to incorporate that into the article ? __label__2 Are you an admin? Do you want to be one ? __label__2 Apologies again, though. If I tell a fart joke, will you forgive me ? __label__2 thanks for that, but can you please elaborate?

Shall I delete it ? __label__2 What does your source table look like?

At that point though, what ' s the difference, right ? __label__2 Nijdam, you quite rightly say, 'Every event that has occurred is a condition'.

Also, would you say that you are primarily interested in when the door opens and closes, not in a "latch"?__label__2 You did a WPMILHIST assessment on this page a while ago; one of your comments was that the "battle honours" section was difficult to read, but weren ' t sure what to do about it. I ' ve changed it to make it ( I think) more accessible; what do you think ? __label__2 i update my question. I meant if i will use cron, i write this in console how my script (or cron) will be know that im using missed or oncoming ? __label__2 Also, how does the "revert all edits" function work? Mainly, what do I put in the box for the secondary confirmation ? __label__2 @Thomas, could you provide any more detail about the "create a poly from overlapping triangles" method? (or should I start a new question?)__label__2 Does it work for multiple OT games? Or should all OT ' s be combined into one box ? __label__2 @Sega: you need to state the question more precisely or it will probably be closed. How is the boundary defined, for example ?__label__2 I do not fully understand your question. Do you want [a custom post type to manage individual images](http://wordpress . stackexchange . com / questions / 639 / creating - an - image - centric - custom - post - type)?__label__2 I noticed that you twice placed a request for citation on the <url> page,<url> <url>, but it was silently removed by <url> <url>. I ' ve removed the sentence altogether; do you think any other action should be taken at this point ? __label__2 Needs some updating. Do you still work on it ? __label__2 What ' s the context? Is this homework ? __label__2 <url> is up for deletion. Can you find some sources in Belarusian ? __label__2 Also, one can probably implement it using the language - level recursion, meaning that the second stack will be present *implicitly* as the "stack" of local contexts of nested function calls. Is this allowed ? __label__2 To clarify: you want to input the two paragraphs one after the other and you want the paragraphs themselves to sync, but not necessarily individual sentences. Am I right ? __label__2 How far apart are your trusses? Do you have any dormers sitting on the roof ? __label__2 After <url> <url>, all / most of the needs specified have been completed. Do you think its worth re - nominating <url> for FA or GA status ? __label__2  " I ' m fairly new to java programming (or programming in general)" So, have you used another programming language before? Which one ? __label__2 Mmm its a little difficult to see on the new one. How about the one on the right ? __label__2 What is a bipartite graph, really? http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Bipartite _ graph doesn ' t say the two node sets should have the same numbers of elements .. so one set can be just empty, is that also a bipartite graph ? __label__2 What is the default value? Can you just set that to 0 when you create the array ? __label__2 The other possibility is that it ' s just fringe history. I ' ll take a look over the few resources relating to ''Texas'' that I have and see whether that is the case ? __label__2 To make it clear: you don ' t want to muck about with the class or package files themselves, but want to put a command (or something) in between the class being loaded and the package being loaded that "switches off" the option. Am I right ? __label__2 I ' m speculating that the rotation of the wheel should sorta match the movement of the road, and thusly it would be nice to have some JavaScript variables to work with that would allow these to sync up. Is that a fair guess, @KThornbloom ? __label__2 Just saw your post to Gonzo. Would you rather I withdrew the FLC then ? __label__2 I think the <url> would be more precise and accurate as <url>. What sayest thou ? __label__2 It needs to be redirected anyone can do that. Is there any information that is in the article that is not in <url>?__label__2 What kind of traffic do these roads see? How many lanes in each ? __label__2 How is the implementation of an 8 - bit adder *not programming related*?

NxM Matrix or bitfields or ? __label__2 Follow - up question: There are some slight errors on the elapsed times displayed on the site due to treating all months uniformly as 30 days and ignoring leap years. Do you think it ' s a good idea to keep these errors to match the site (see my answer) or should we try to fix them ? __label__2 I have a quick question for you (I ' m asking now since I am sure that this is going to be brought up either at the ACR or the FAC, when I finally get there): you ' ve added a "pp." for the citation given for the national defense authorization act of 2007, but the rest of the article makes use of the "p." system. Shouldn ' t the "pp." be changed to a "p." for conformity, or is the use of the "pp." correct from the perspective of citation guidelines ? __label__2 Just parents / children, or all ancestors / descendants? Also, which flavour of SQL are you using ? __label__2 I ' ve been "busy" (all day today in Death Valley admiring the spring bloom), and I would like to get at least partial buyin from HG if possible.

If the latter, what is the connection between the advertising and the video ? __label__2 Thanks. This circuit I ' m tapping into already has a GFCI receptacle on it. So I ' m OK, right ? __label__2 Define *"complexity of a nested binary search tree"*. For that matter, define *"nested binary search tree"* (do you mean subtree?)__label__2 But that doesn ' t follow <url>. Perhaps you can discuss the idea there ? __label__2 I can ' t find any API documentation. Can you provide it ? __label__2 And you can qualify for multiple non - overlapping packages? So, if I buy 3-$5 6-$10 and 5-$20, I would pay $15+$55+$90 = $160 ? __label__2 `for k in **kwargs:`? can you paste the actual code you are using ? __label__2 I just traced an IP you just blocked for six months, <url>, and it is a school IP. Is this block an anonymous only block, or is it a full block ? __label__2 If you need the image to fill either height or width to the corresponding dimensions of the div, I can only think of using javascript. Is that something you are keen to explore ? __label__2 Class methods, aka "static" methods can be defined like so inside a class: `self . i _ am _ a _ method _ on _ self _ and _ some _ call _ me _ static`. Ps. Are you enjoying Ruby so far? :)__label__2 By the way, I ' ve been getting extremely slow speeds on here today. Is it going fine for you, or are you also experiencing 3 minute page loads ? __label__2 @Alexander this is a little bit of an argumentative question. Do you think you could phrase it better ? __label__2 or anything else? So mutable linked list is allowed ? __label__2 And what about loops? Or do we have to loop with recursion ? __label__2 Well, works for me anyway - http://paste . ubuntu . com / 509394/.

Do we still want to do this ? __label__2 Are you able to access the file using the "?" instead of the escape code or the special char ? __label__2 I ' m really seeing no evidence that this image is free. Are you able to shed any light on the issue ? __label__2 There may be a way to show a limited amount of content and then expand it or open in a box onclick using a custom script. How tied are you to the particular interface scetched in your image ? __label__2 One has `const`, and the other does not. Is this intended ? __label__2 This seems like a workable approach, but I don ' t see an actual question here. Are you asking how to make use of the result of your "direction" function to actually move an object ? __label__2 please can you add to your question the results of the following: `sudo lshw -class network` followed by `rfkill list`. Also - what happens if you deactivate the B43 driver and activate the STA driver ? __label__2 <url> finally got created, but I ' m wondering whether it should be merged with <url>. Can it be expanded ? __label__2 No, it is for a student project (matrix calculation with multiple processes), but for this step I have to use mmap. Is there another way to share the variable between all my processes ?__label__2 It isn ' t clear to me that he knew WHO Amorrow was, someone has left a message that will hopefully set him straight. Do you have a link to the blog ? __label__2 Are you still experiencing this problem. If not, how did you fix it ? __label__2 I downloaded VandalProof, but it says that I ' m not on the user list.

VB & LN ? __label__2 He ''is'' offering the article to you, I think. Can you review the ''The Downward Spiral'' article <url>?__label__2 What is it you are encrypting with mcrypt? Is it a serialized session from `$_SESSION`?__label__2 Are you using annotations or a mapping file? PATH - TO - OPENJPA . jar, which jar are you pointing at ? __label__2 Nobody? Even with the bounty??__label__2 Hi, I was just going to query your recent removal of the <url> article, without merging any of the article ' s content into <url>'s article. Was there any particular reason for the loss of content ? __label__2 I was about to ask the same question on <url>. Did you ever find out ? __label__2 It ' s not bizarre and random because I believe it violates the policies of <url> and <url> as its using Wikipedia for non - Wikipedia related projects. You say it ' s a sandbox for your new Wiki, why not put the sandbox ON that wiki ? __label__2 Ebay links are ephemeral, and often disappear in time. Is it possible to find another example link ? __label__2 maybe it ' s just me, but this seems too open ended, subjective, and probably depends on your particular research area. what kind of advice are you expecting ? __label__2 What kind of diagrams are we talking about here? I think the question may be too broad as it is (it ' d be like asking "what software programs are used to create desktop wallpaper?").__label__2 Are there any constraints on the variables? E . g. integer type, implicit int->bool conversion, etc ? __label__2 Naive question: why not sequential? What does it buy you ? __label__2 Sorry - you confused me. If language only recognizes keys - shouldn ' t the example your provided be "language = {latin and german}"?__label__2 I noticed here <url> you mentioned "horing". Is that just a spelling typo for "honoring"?__label__2 Do you have any example? Could it be a path issue ? __label__2 Fair enough. Shell, can I suggest wacking his userspace drafts while you ' re at it ? __label__2 I would think the name of the document might be less of an issue than the subject, recipient address and body of the message that you send it with. Do you also need the rest of the email to be encrypted ? __label__2 You want to partition the map into subgraphs. The size of the subgraphs has to adhere to some bounds (max, min size) and the number of edges between partitions shall be minimized ? __label__2 what about the link on the sidebar that points to this help? Is it disappeared ? __label__2 I noticed that you have a lot of empty or blanked sandboxes that you used before moving articles to mainspace.

Could you please give a reference ? __label__2 By literal value, do you mean the string? Or the ascii integer value ? __label__2 Which platform are you using? If it ' s ASP . NET do you have access to the App _ Browsers folder ? __label__2 What is the pixel size of your JPEG file? Of the generated icon ? __label__2 What do you mean by bare - bones? Supporting nothing, but A lookups? :)__label__2 Why do you think the crawler ignores invisible text? (how can it even tell if a text is white - on - white, too small or out of bounds?)__label__2 Not sure. Maybe try the <url>?__label__2 These words are, to my mind, completely unrelated. What ' s the difference between *taxi*, *green*, and *kitchen*?__label__2 I wondered, simply because I see you occasionally and had never seen him before, so at first I thought he was you. I wonder if there ' s a User : Nyttned running around ? __label__2 What permissions are you using (i . e. 755)?__label__2 There is no difference between rules specified in the document and rules specified externally. Are you sure the external CSS file is being included correctly, and are you waiting until it ' s been loaded via `onload`?__label__2 What happens if there are inconsistencies? Would that be an exception condition ? __label__2 Agreed with Itay. Would you mind updating your code and putting it into code - tags ? __label__2 It looks like 80x86 assembly. Who else would name the registers as Intel did ? __label__2 Could you please clarify what do you mean by _password format_? How passwords are hashed for storage in database ? __label__2 Hello. Regarding <url>, could you tell me what supports this being a free image ? __label__2 Nice app! Any news about opening the source code ? __label__2 Just to clarify, you want to do non - bidirectional data transfer because the server will not ack. But you also want the server to push out data to these clients ? __label__2 No way. Still don ' t believe I found this question on Stack Overflow ;) So the next time you apply the `Goto` function, will you do `Goto ( Io, \epsilon)` where `Io` is that first state ? __label__2 Hi I saw you mentioned that DirecTV has plans to add MSNBC HD upon launch on <url> but the source you referenced has nothing about DirecTV in it, its just about the HD launch itself, so I removed it per <url>. Do you have a source that specifically says DirecTV WILL add it upon launch ? __label__2 How are you hiding the image? Are you using a javascript framework like jQuery, Mootools or Prototype ? __label__2 It ' s being referenced in project . pbxproj. Did you rename the executable as well ? __label__2 what are the results of your efforts? What is happening instead of what you want to happen ? __label__2 The logic that determines the Fields from the HTML is not obvious. Could you add some information here ? __label__2  * in some conditions i want this tag to be completely disabled*: What does this mean? What conditions ? __label__2 What have you got so far? Show us where you are stuck: is it on the JOINs, the filtering ? __label__2 I find that "GIS for the masses" is an oxymoron, I end up calling it computer mapping or web mapping. Does your question include browser based mapping apps ? __label__2 Does the exception have any message included? Perhaps some details or an innerException ? __label__2 I don ' t know how generic you need this, but do you need to be wary of more than one where clause, e . g. in a subquery ? __label__2 So the size of [-5,-2] is -2 - (-5) = 3? Wouldnt [12,-2] with -2 - 12 = -14 be better ? __label__2 You stated opengl, but not a language. Are you using C ? __label__2 I want to use an already existing encryption algorithm, so how am I designing this from scratch? I need to add somekind of code myself though to actually use this algorithm, right ? __label__2 Great. How do I find those ? __label__2  " If you have played GTA 4, then you have probably been drunk at some stage." Because you must have been drunk to play a GTA game, eh? ;)__label__2 Tips? Something about not feeding ? __label__2 What have you tried? What didn ' t work ? __label__2 Take a look at the speedy delete I just posted. Was that the right one to do or was an AFD called for there ? __label__2 Your requirements needs clarification: do you need this to be cryptographically secure and unique or simply unique? In other words, would a potential attacker crafting a "unique" ID be a threat or not ? __label__2 Well.. actually it is <nowiki><!--commented--></nowiki>. Could it be visible ? __label__2 When you say you emailed Crystal, do you mean ''Crystal Evans, AKA Country Girl in Girl Authority?''

If you recreate the view after you add the data does it show up ? __label__2 What is the submit method ? a regular submit or an ajax submit ?__label__2 @Billy: Assume you would start as my colleague today and would have to touch this code. How would you know that you cannot use virtual methods in this particular class ? __label__2 A word changed or omitted here and there is normal (I notice this because I ' m deaf as a post and find myself turning on the captions constantly when I watch DVDs), but the discrepancies are quite pervasive, so much as to change the tone, if note the content, of the dialogue, which definitely is not normal. Do you think I need to expand my edit to make that point ? __label__2 That explains some things, guess this ' ll take getting used to (not to mention the dozens of dabs I have to go back and re - fix). So, do you recall <url> by any chance ? __label__2 What is your take on the Simpson ' s images problem ? Should I remove them from your user page ?__label__2 That should work. Why do you think it does not ? __label__2 Could you define 'lighten' ? Do you mean lower calorie, paler color, a more tender crumb, a more delicate texture, or less weight per given volume ? __label__2 Yup, as Josh said.

Can you add the elaboration from your comments to the question ? __label__2 Someone already asked this question about the Mac Pro (2 , 1)—see [Mac Pro video card recommendations](http://apple . stackexchange . com / questions / 7561 / mac - pro - video - card - recommendations). Do the responses there answer this question ? __label__2 Where does it crash? Do you have a backtrace ? __label__2 I ' m going to have to say that a "Socionics Institute" is not going to cut it as a reliable source for notability. Can you come up with a third party ? __label__2 I ' m curious, just for a laugh, what was that reference all about? Something to do with an author with the initials HST ? __label__2 Is the picture showing white ONLY in a browser? Or is it showing white even in windows ? __label__2 @Mike: Can we give this some traction? I don ' t understand the question fully, so you can probably give some example ? __label__2 Without the test cases is hard to prove a solution right or wrong.

Or just the game screen behind the OptionsMenuState ? __label__2 what value is imgRepGetCache? is it null ? __label__2 Uh, okay, the tabs for the pull - down menues, which were visible to me before, are no longer visible. Is this because i screwed up a setting with Twinkle, or because my thinkpad is not displaying the entire page (preliminary fiddling around seems to eliminate this possibility)?__label__2 Well, why would you expect OSX programs to be runnable on Linux? What about these two specific OS ' s makes you mention them in the question, but not any other OS that also can ' t run OSX programs ? __label__2 Was kind of hoping there ' d be a solution that didn ' t involve an external link. Is there ? __label__2 Lev, it seems like tex is now enabled. can you try to edit your post to use latex and see if it works ?__label__2 I must admit: I ' m a little curious as to why you asked this question :-). Did you get any shots from a plane or helictoper ? __label__2 Failing the answers below, copy and paste from Contacts app to Messaging app should just work without any problem, I ' ve used it a few times before to copy lines from addresses, emails and that sort of thing into a SMS. Are you sure you long - pressed long enough in the SMS message to get the input menu up with the Paste option on it ? __label__2 The title of this post is really unclear, and has unnecessary shouting. Something like "Tool to visualize metadata from many photos?"__label__2 Your input data does not seem to have all the fields that the Google format requires. Where are you intending to get the missing data from ? __label__2 Per site, no. In the future, who can say ? __label__2 Can you give us some idea of your budget ? __label__2 not a direct answer to your question. but shouldn ' t you be opening exclusive ? __label__2 I was actually hoping for a method where I just place the fish on top of the rice directly. Would this not work ? __label__2 @mfg - I ' m not sure what the best way is to do this. You ' re planning to do a separate CW question or a post over at BF ? __label__2 The lack of `display _ name` is caused by a user not having a display name set in their profile. Incorrect usernames.. do you have an example of that ? __label__2 Sorry, reading a bit about alpha testing - it seems to come at the end of the pipeline, which introduces aliasing problems: http://blogs . msdn . com / b / shawnhar / archive / 2011 / 05 / 06 / antialiasing - alpha - cutouts . aspx.

Also, is it acceptable to popup user / password dialogs ? __label__2 I see we ' ve been reading the same article on <url> years. Can you address my question on the talk page ? __label__2 It seems that this is not possible. Are there any Intellij folks on StackOverflow ? __label__2 Yes. What other types of images are like logos (cannot be used in templates; only articles)?__label__2 I would also alter the title; currently it looks like an auto spambot. Maybe 'How to develop a concept and gain funding' might be good ? __label__2 How long does it take to complete the process? Will you allow more than one web user simultaneously ? __label__2 If you want I could simply remove the maps from each article, its not that important. What do you think ? __label__2 how are the cross sections given? polygons ? __label__2 __There was also a misunderstanding of the standard by OS implementors, notably Microsoft and Linux which erroneously map file systems with (primary) partitions instead of subdividing their own partition in slices like BSD and Solaris which was the original intended goal.__ I dint understand this. Could you please elaborate on this ? __label__2 Which debugger are you using? Have you tried the script debugger in IE8 ? __label__2 Hiya FFM, I want to update the <url> page to make it a proper article and perhaps get it to FA status; I know it ' s unusual to be part of one ' s own organization editing, but it is possible -- if we work on a draft in userspace and have friends / colleagues helping update the article proper. Are you interested in working on this in the coming week or so ? __label__2 Voting to close as off - topic. http://math . stackexchange . com maybe ? __label__2 Regarding "within the church", the problem is on one end that purring that prepositional at the beginning feels very clunky, but that other formulations almost all result in something like "at .. at", which is no better.

Are you ready to start the RfA ? __label__2 By chance, I have indef blocked <person> over your 31 - hour block. Would you like me to keep indef block or change it back to 31 hours ? __label__2 I ' ll never understand the alcohol thing.

Do you have this with more games ? __label__2 In .Net? C# or VB ? __label__2 Joe is right. Maybe we could merge the two questions / answers ? __label__2 Can you give me a general description of <url>? Does it mention anything about making movie ? __label__2 The comments on the youtube mention that the framerate is too low to play the game comfortably. Why do you want to do this ? __label__2 at the end of the <nowiki><head> </head></nowiki>. Could that be fixed again, please ? __label__2 What does `j^4` do? Is this XOR or exponentiation ? __label__2 for what purpose? why not just generate an API key and use that ? __label__2 I think I don ' t clearly understand the question. Why a naive sampler with a chernoff bound is not a good estimator ?__label__2 I can ' t find it. Maybe I didn ' t manage to guess the right name; can you find it in your contribs ? __label__2 3 . 5 . 0 . 52 ExtendScript 4 . 1 . 23 ScriptUI 5 . 1 . 37.

Or is it a phenomenon that occurs just at the moment of Mach = 1 ? __label__2 dirs -l -p gives me `/home / phunehehe`, and running L=\`dirs -l -p\`; echo $L always gives me `/home / phunehehe`. Why are you using it to test "multiline output"?__label__2 Is your problem to match a **subset** of your input lines to a route from the root in the tree?

In this fashion you will soon get enough "trusted citizen" susceptible of flagging offensive data ?__label__2 I think I have fixed this, but I am not sure. Where do I stand with use of publicity photographs, created with the express intention of promoting someone or thing ? __label__2 What exactly are you trying to select? The element with `$('span . displayField').text()` as the current text ? __label__2 Good stuff. Do you have diffs for your direct questions to Betacommand ? __label__2 What is on the other 9 pages? Are they blank ? __label__2 Good question, actually. I really hope it ' s not homework.. is it ? __label__2 Oh, in that case you want <url>. So Vigen Geodakyan is your father ? __label__2 @Alan: Do you mean to say that you are looking for image editing software which will automatically spit out the hex code / array you can use in your Arduino code to display said image? If so, why not let them write it (perhaps based on some codebase you write yourself) taking a [PBM image](http://netpbm . sourceforge . net / doc / pbm . html) to start with ? __label__2 "..element 3 was compatible with 1": I don ' t see this in your chart. And if 3 is compatible with 1, why is 1 not compatible with 3 ? __label__2 Still thinking. What do you suggest ? __label__2 Hm.. I can think of some.. though unfortunately not by name.

Do the edges have differing lengths ? __label__2 I see your nomination of Template : GR today, and I ' d ask you to look at my proposal. If you like it, would you be willing to find someone with the technical knowhow to try it out ? __label__2 Thankyou Fail, but the template I want is the one that goes at the bottom of the article and produces a message that goes something like 'This article is a copy of the (X) article in the German wikipedia, version 21 December 2009 10 : 04.' What is that template ? __label__2 Hello; I was just browing through and I happened to come across <url> page.

Just wondering why you deleted the OneCone International article ? __label__3 I ' m not sure about your question, but are you sure that is correctly implementing the [Fibonacci sequence?](http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Fibonacci _ numb). Surely your code will generate `1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8,..` whereas the correct sequence is `0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8,..` ?__label__3 You do `SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE id _ products=13 AND name="audio" AND value="2 . 1" AND name="hdd" AND value="200 gb"` but that won ' t return anything because there is no row that has all these values. Are you looking for OR instead of AND ? __label__3 What do you mean by 'temperamental'? Exactly what is happening ? __label__3 I think the `[special - relativity]` tag could be dropped from this, since although the theory of Dirac fermions requires SR "behind the scenes" in order to be consistent, we ' re not talking about relativity directly. Did you have a particular reason for including the tag ? __label__3 I noticed that the bot is now using the duplicate template instead of the db - redundantimage template. Is there a reason for the switch ? __label__3 Mtrombley--you said you got a solution. Can you post it ? __label__3 @Jen sorry to be patronising. Are you confusing *square numbers* (numbers raised to the power of two) and *powers of two*?__label__3 Are you asking how to use csv? http://docs . python . org / library / csv . html What ' s wrong with the documentation ? __label__3 Maybe, but it won ' t be any more readable. Why do you want to ? __label__3 Well, I haven ' t seen a lot there, but the pages that I ' ve seen were sourced. Does this mean you consider a sourced article in Wikipedia also unreliable ? __label__3 I had to look at the source of if _ javascript() to understand how atrocious it is.

If not, could you explain briefly why you have the same IP address and is posting similar questions ? __label__3 The Radical Afrocentric Historiography article is now redirecting to Afrocentrism, on the basis it seems that its a subsection of Afrocentrism. Where else would like me to put it ? __label__3 Not sure a honeypot that isn ' t in a production environment will teach you anything - you need attackers to connect to it in order to learn. Unless you are trying to do something different ? __label__3 I ' d prefer it to be more generic, but that it SHOULD include the UK. Surely there must be Mint . com clones that have worldwide coverage ? __label__3 I guess there ' s a connection to <url> too. Do you think that ' s cu worthy ? __label__3 It should be. What happens when you try it ? __label__3 What do you want to obtain from parsing?

What purpose does the element serve ? __label__3 @Deepak "key path"? What ' s that ? __label__3 Just to clarify, is this a 20ft span with two 10ft beams, and a post in the middle that will support the ends of the two 10ft beams? If so, why not just make a 20ft beam ? __label__3 This question is not clear - are you talking about a system you ' re developing, that needs to store a credential client side? Or are you talking about a home user / end user PoV ? __label__3 Well, if Mattisse has caused me to CU innocent editors, then it ' s time for her to be blocked from editing her own talk page. MC, do you think I should withdraw the CU or let it ride ? __label__3 What kind of riding do you plan on doing? Other criteria for this bike ? __label__3 What do you mean by "expected running time"? Are you taking the expectation over some random distribution of inputs (as most of the answers seem to think), or over the distribution of random bits used by the algorithm (the usual meaning for randomized algorithms), or both ? __label__3 I don ' t want to risk the drive using truecrypt, It has too much important data. Any other solution please ? __label__3 @Bobby: A 3 - meg file takes time to load and resize - 1 second doesn ' t seem too bad. Is there any way you can save the thumbs once they ' ve been generated, so you won ' t have to generate all of them again the next time the folder is visited ? __label__3 I have the Nikon D3100 and was wondering if the autofocus on the Nikon AF - S Nikkor 35mm f / 1 . 8G DX Lens would work with it? also i am going to buy Sigma Zoom Super Wide Angle 18 - 200mm f / 3 . 5 - 6 . 3 DC OS (Optical Stabilizer) does this particular lens support D3100 ? __label__3 What do you mean with `Good Effect`?

What was it ? __label__3 You could simply use a bunch of XML files in a zip file, and whatever file extension you want. Why the verylongtagnumbers??__label__3 May I also ask how CheckUser became involved in the matter? To justify such a use of computer records, surely someone needs to invoke a due process of some kind for the action to be justified ? __label__3 I can ' t quite figure out when you ' re auditing the Transport Phenomena course. It might help to provide more context: is *motivation* really the right word, or is it more cause - and - effect ? __label__3 I don ' t see you saying that you have measured the performance and found it lacking. Out of curiosity: how much slower is the extra method call, and what are you doing that is sensitive to this small slow down ? __label__3 I ' m responding here in an effort to keep the conversation in one place and would appreciate it if you would do the same. Did you see where I said above that images which only allow non - commercial use are still considered to be non - free ? __label__3 @Jader, the title of the question and the actual question seem somewhat different. It seems to me that the title of the question should be something more like "What are the benefits of googles over glasses for cycling?"__label__3 Did you see the edit by Marrtel - <url> - to <url> ? Is that a reasonable change ?__label__3 Could someone please explain to me the statement in more detail? Eg. if k=1 and R is x<y, then what will be A ? __label__3 I like your hypothesis, however a more sinister option could be that they were attempting to use the tethering feature of their iPhone to take files off your network without them passing through your gateway. Although I think your hypothesis is more likely (do you work somewhere that people would go so such lengths to steal data?)__label__3 @belisarius: Without trying to understand it, what is it ' s complexity? And how does it compare to a solution using merge sort then simple traversal (which would be `O ( n log n)`)?__label__3 If you are beccoming a target again do you want semi prot for a while? How much activity is it getting ? __label__3 what is a seawall? (It is a name that is only used in the USA?)__label__3 He ' s back <url>, <url> as <url>. Also, in the future would you rather me just post these to <url>, or do you just want to continue handeling him ? __label__3 Would you please edit the title and text to specify that this is a question about MSN camera support in Empathy? Also: what do you mean by "I have problem to change files with it too"?__label__3 This looks like it could be a fantastic solution.

What sort of "Board action" were you referring to ? __label__3  ( a , b , d , c)? Are you sure ? __label__3 I''ll send you some User - Agent headers and server logs. What would you like them to say ? __label__3 Sorry, I still have trouble grasping scope of your issue. May be you could add actual code to the question so it is more clear what it currently does and what needs to be improved ? __label__3 but how you represent that in the datastore, i know that you can have a list of keys like parameter in your class, but in the datastore? you made a third entity to strore the keys of the entities in the relationship ? __label__3 Can you enable it again manually? and if so how ? __label__3 Oosterman is hardly the world ' s foremost expert on Hyper - Calvinism.

How do I do that ? __label__3 The article has been heavily rewritten since your remark / objection on <url>. How is the article now ? __label__3 I don ' t see what you mean with this question, nor can I imagine what kind of answer you search. Could you please elaborate more ? __label__3 and what ' s the problem? what did you try and in which way did it fail ? __label__3 Cubic Bezier curve ALWAYS depends on exactly 4 control points. Maybe you want to make a http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Spline_(mathematics) from several curves or something ? __label__3 I ' ve been called a British unionist, Devolutionist & Irish Nationalist, over the years. Not bad, eh ? __label__3 At least he keeps the same account, some users manage to get into an edit war, find their own way to WP : 3RR, and edit their monobook --all on their first day!

Please rephrase your question as "What video players do you recommend for Ubuntu?"__label__3 Can you phrase your question in the form of a question? Preferably a programming question ? __label__3 I ' ve never played the RPG. What more information does it provide about Argos, Atlas, Julie, Ron, and the FISS Metas ? __label__3 I ' m afraid that I don ' t understand the question. Could you clarify it and explain exactly what aspect of TeX you are asking about ? __label__3 The article might assert that the subject is notable, but the references are too weak to back up that assertion. Can I proceed with a prod or AfD ? __label__3 A quick question: I ' ve noticed that people (including yourself) have been moving links to other wikis from the top of the article to the bottom. If this a good thing to do, then I can do likewise, but I wondered if there was a rationale / convention here ? __label__3 But the block you ' ve used is messing with me accessing WP though my user account; do you know why? Or if it can be fixed, without unblocking ? __label__3 Name ' s don ' t change. I ' m going to have say, that his name is to be kept in the article however what about creating a page about Harry Potter characters in fanfiction or something like that ? __label__3 The placement of the hyphen in "Ekur - huleni" seems odd: as far as I know "rh" is one sound in Tsonga. Maybe "Eku - rhuleni"?__label__3 lovely answers here, but isn ' t the diameter twice the radius of a circle ? __label__3 the title is a bit awkward, I had no idea what the Q was about before reading it. Perhaps "great GIS, maps & cartography quotes"?__label__3 @zaf look at the picture here: http://i . imgur . com / 22yAQ . jpg , perhaps slightly more rotated. How can you fit such a rectangle inside this one ? __label__3 You should be more specific - do you need to send the value in the fastest way or in a 'fast enough' way? How often are you reading the ADC ? __label__3 no; just added it in question too. Should it has to be debug build ? __label__3 Maybe this should be two questions? I didn ' t even realize until I looked at the answers, but it seems to completely change direction after "Which window manager would you suggest?"__label__3 Can you please edit your question so that the title fits to the text? "Suddenly" does not seem to involve moving VBox to a different location, does it ;)?__label__3 i ' m not sure..but don ' t you need Android 2 . 2 to debug with gdb? Do you have Android 2 . 2 on your Droid ? __label__3 A lot of us behind corporate firewalls won ' t be able to follow your link. Can you post a link to the actual url ? __label__3 do u have any error? In which part you struck ? __label__3 Interesting; I thought I was fairly familiar with Wikipedia rules. Which rules exactly did I violate by closing an AfD (allegedly) without reading the underlying article ? __label__3 I see you don ' t edit the heats from morning session. Will you be here for the finals ?__label__3 What do you mean with 'the orthogonal between p1 and p3'? Do you mean the diagonal of p1 and p3 (as the diagram suggests)?__label__3 I ' m sorry I don ' t follow you Ok, this is where I would tell my popup to close. But `window . close()` won ' t work here either, will it ? __label__3 I have it now; it lists 22 Members, seven officers and a large number of sons of Members. Do you think we could run to a new article, say <url>?__label__3 @Trillian Oh bummer. What does "number tile complexities" mean ? __label__3 Sorry, but i won ' t use a module for that task. So you have no idea about this ? __label__3 As I suspected, user CBERLET reverted my work on the recruitment section -- he just spouts JARGON as a magic - keyword and hits his button.

Do not work because of my Chrome version ? __label__3 Sure. Aside from the Flea and Frusciante articles, which get the most traffic ? __label__3 I can ' t figure this one out - adding the values of int pointers makes sense, but adding two char pointers together doesn ' t make sense for values or addresses. What is the outcome you ' re expecting ? __label__3 Any idea whether there are triangular bags that you could use as regular bags ? __label__3 You might want to re - architect this; if you are counting the number of files / folders every minute, you are creating a race condition. What about having each function update a counter, or use a lockfile to ensure that the periodic process doesn ' t update the count until both functions have finished executing ? __label__3 updated the question. can i do that in a scope ? __label__3 About your last edit to <url>. Do you have a source ? __label__3 In what way do the GMTV images, such as <url>, conform with the guidelines at <url>? Where is the statement on the website saying that it is a press kit, and the images can be reproduced ? __label__3 <url> is a bit of a stretch. Do you think you might strike it ? __label__3 When I find 20 sources calling an Individual Armenian including TURKISH, the NYT and Time ' s article are presented in a dubious manner, how can I bey considered aggressive? It is the duty of every editor and admin to weed out Original research and dubious citations, no ? __label__3 Ok, that seems acceptable. Did I remove something like that ? __label__3 I ' ve poked around with an LP solver and the Nash equilibrium seems not to have an obvious, nice description. Where are you going with this ? __label__3 Hi! Why did you remove the reference to "300 miles from Graceland" from the "Wombats in Popular Culture" section ? __label__3 Google does not readily spit out anything obviously relevent on "Arthur theorem prover". Can you please give a reference ? __label__3 How do you make your signature all wierd the way you do? For example, you have a link to your user talk next to your name that appears as a COF album name..how ' d you do that ? __label__3 Another article created by Jergens. Is this one legitimate ? __label__3 Did you read http://developer . android . com / guide / developing / device . html and did you follow the instructions there? If so, what do you see if you execute "adb devices"?__label__3 Please tell us more about your prototype. Do you want to prototype a web - application or a desktop application ? __label__3 I would advise against creating seperate articles for individual characters and stick to the list. Is this what you ' d expect a typical encyclopedia to be covering ? __label__3 $() and $j()? why? do you use jQuery . noConflict()?__label__3 @Kara: Perhaps rephrase the question: Is it OK to listen to music while cycling? When I first saw the title I thought it might be something like "What types of music do you listen to while cycling?"__label__3 What is the question? What is the tag facebook - hacker - up ? __label__3 The minimum sum would be found by taking the smallest number, then subtracting all other numbers from it. Do you mean "closest to zero"?__label__3 I don ' t mean to sound argumentative, but asking the question, did Britain not have the capability to repair aircraft carriers during the second world war ''is'' connected to the article. If it were true, could it not be added to the article ? __label__3 Same question as @Justian Meyer plus one of my own: what exactly must you output? A simple yes or no if one rectangle ' s edges intersect another if their length increases, or report possible intersections for each line ? __label__3 A class I have to take, is this task to hard? Am i asking the impossible ? __label__3 Modules are required to return a true value when being loaded. Why not let a faulty plugin return zero when initialization fails ? __label__3 I am not super familiar with android development. Can ' t you use java util Preferences http://download . oracle . com / javase / 1 . 4 . 2 / docs / api / java / util / prefs / Preferences . html ?__label__3 Yeah, that poor old schlub prolly woulda been me, haha! What a game though, eh ? __label__3 He has now switched from controversially closing AfDs to controversially tagging every episode in TV series (currently ''Heroes'' and ''Star Trek'') with Notability tags. Is this user in need of a block to let him know that WP is not about making points to others based on our own personal opinions ? __label__3 Do you want everything in between `Begin` and `End;` of the procedures / functions as well? Or are you only interested in the names of them ? __label__3 @Jim: That is the declaration of the function, it is not called. Where is `printme` called ? __label__3 Even with big arrays, loops should not take much time. What ' s taking time I guess is comparing objects.. Could you be more specific ? __label__3 Please sign comments using four tildes, as I ' m not sure who you are..? Which article are you speaking about ? __label__3 I found that you have participated in the last <url> concerning the use of flag icons, but I wonder why it appears that the talk reached to an end without a real guideline or consensus. Would you consider restarting a guideline proposal which indicates when these tiny flags should be used (or at least when they should not be)?__label__3 Sorry, I meant `/usr / local / texlive / 2010 / texmf - config / web2c / updmap . cfg`, not `/usr / local / texlive / 2010 / texmf / web2c / updmap . cfg`. Is `Map uop . map` present in the former file ? __label__3 I don ' t think this should have been relegated to the CW junkheap. What ' s the rationale ? __label__3 Why can ' t this work? `var s1 = "a\"b"; var s2 = "\"" + s1 + "\"";` ?__label__3 What exactly have you tested? You tested for the value you expect, I understand ? __label__3 I personally don ' t think templates such as that are that good but this template connects a lot of different categories and articles together to try to grasp a huge subject . Have I made my idea clear ? __label__3 Are you concerned with the fact that these are glass, or that they ' re shallow pans ? __label__3 What can you say about <url>, some of them are marked as stubs. Is it correct ? __label__3 P m i meetin teddy & snowy today??__label__3 I ' m not totally sure what you mean. Are you asking for a list of all featured articles on the English Wikipedia ? __label__3 ..Bipolar? Electronic Jekyll - Hyde? :-P__label__3 I added a link to some pretty images to indicate what I want to get. Steve, I added (probably far too many) details to the question statement -- does that answer your questions ? __label__3 @henchen: Sorry to ask, but doesn ' t an extractor suffices? Why are you considering hash functions ? __label__3 I remember the original question asking about a solution in Python. Am I going insane ? __label__3 What have you tried? What didn ' t work ? __label__3 Do you know if the Department of Water & Power is free of racism and discrimination? Do you know anyone in the company ? __label__3 I was rather puzzled by the scattering of Canada stub sub - categories through the several listings pages, and had re - top - sorted a number of them before noticing that they seem to have been ''un''top - sorted by yourself, in considerable numbers. What ' s your thinking here ? __label__3 I am alright, though I am no <url> or Sandy. Which article is this regarding, Milner ? __label__3 Third, what picture then should go into the Harrison Ford infobox? Would this one (Image : Harrison Ford 1) do it ? __label__3 I don ' t understand the "go all the way until the end" part. Why wasn ' t 4 highlighted in the third line in your second example, and why wasn ' t 2 highlighted in the second line in the same example ? __label__3 Umm..what? Can you please clarify your answer ? __label__3 LOL what did he say in the press??__label__3 Scalebars usually measure distance, but a swimming pool might be a volume or an area. Or do you mean the length of a swimming pool ? __label__3 What is this regarding? OpenGL ? __label__3 Unreliable websites should be avoided altogether as even their citations might be wrong. Do you see a specific problem with the AKC breed standard ? __label__3 What are the numbers <url>? Are they population figures ? __label__3 <url> It would be better if the content was not quite so pejorative. Perhaps a rewording ? __label__3 Thoughts? Preferences ? __label__3 Hello! Um - are you looking for me to do something about that BRFA, or actually write a bot to perform that task ? __label__3 ..come to think of it, this is kind of a really nitpicky question, but <url> ''does'' count as current head of the "main" Matsudaira family, right? Since it only became renamed and all but it ' s still the continuation of the same family ? __label__3 Are you asking if there is some "Automatic" way to do this? Or if its possible at all ? __label__3 There used to be a Flash version made by Sega themselves. Where did that go ? __label__3 I just occurred to me yesterday (while playing with the Bushnell 7x50 Marine binocs I got for my birthday), that the <url> section on rangefinding reticles might be worth its own article, if for no other reason than that rangefinding reticles are used on other optics, such as said binoculars (which have a compass and 5 milliradian graduated reticle) and some other specialized items, such as golf rangefinding monoculars, which use the standardized height of the flag as the known size item. So what do you think--is there enough content in the rangefinding section to make a standalone article, and do I provide enough argument to justify pulling it out, and adding links from <url> and <url>?__label__3 Also what are the screen dimensions? I . e. will the screen always be smaller than 512x512 ? __label__3 Btw, after answering I realized I wasn ' t clear about something - is this referring to Local Administrator, or e . g. Domain Admins ? __label__3 In this code sample, you are opening a filehandle in read (`<`) mode and then `print`'ing to it. Is that what you meant to say ? __label__3 @SKM : is your primary intent to **hide** the latent images, or to merely **combine** a number of images into a single image? Also, from your code, exactly what error are you encountering ? __label__3 Are you using a plugin? (Is this restful _ authentication?)__label__3 Is there any kind of system for working on things? I mean, if you ' ve taken something on, are you supposed to just do it and say so after the fact or are you supposed to mention it on the WikiProject Germany page ? __label__3 Can you determine if it ' s a software or hardware issue? What happens if you boot into the Mac OS installer, or some other bootable CD ? __label__3 Compression is highly dependent on the source data. Since you say your matrices are "small sizes", why not post one ? __label__3 I very much disagree that the article that was deleted was advertising; I have never bought anything from his store as a matter of fact, but I do know that his is one of the most used online Judaica shops out there. What can I do to make the article acceptable ? __label__3 Basta colla tua grecofilia tendenzionista! Ai capito bene ? __label__3 Does it have to be Linux? Have you considered ZFS (An older, stable version 14) on FreeBSD 8 . 1 ? __label__3 As a UM Bishop he is certainly notable. What was the source of the copyvio ? __label__3 I assume you can code a balanced tree as a data structure.

Are you really claiming that even a TODO list isn ' t useful ? __label__3 So the nomination was made by your sock. Could you explain why you choose to use a sock ? __label__3 Your description of `guess()` needs improvement. Does it return `true` when you guess is less or equal to the answer ? __label__3 Please make your question more clear, preferably with examples.

Was the eclipse bashing really necessary ? __label__3 Just out of interest, how long is "incredibly long"? How fast does the program run for other puzzles ? __label__3 I alfred. What model (on your data) do you use to estimate the mean and SE ?__label__3 Explain what you mean by non - smaller? You mean bigger ? __label__3 Does this <url> mean that individuals (e . g. Salvador Abascal) should be removed from category : antisemitism and its child categories ? __label__3 It ' s better to follow Rails conventions by placing your images in the public / images directory rather than some other location. Could you please explain why you ' re breaking convention ? __label__3 I find it odd you have to define both the height and the width for an image, when your are displaying the image are you defining the width and height already? eg. `<img src="" height="y" width="x">` and have you tried using `display: none` instead of the visibility property ? __label__3 I do not understand. Do you like to show your view inside a UIScrollView (so it can go down or up together) or you like to set the frame when you rotate your device ? __label__3 Your datatype is Datetime or Date or Varchar ?

Could you please elaborate as to how I would create and save this file ? __label__3 <url> is telling me that your talk page and <url> supposedly both link there, but I can ' t find them for the life of me. Any ideas ? __label__3 @dustin Ok, do you want me to just close that question and merge your other account into this here then (ie. merge dustin - http://stackoverflow . com / users / 783534 / dustin - into this one here - dustin ledezma) ?__label__3 Maybe a filesystem issue ?

Have you any comments ? __label__3 I have also put speedy delete tags on <url> and <url>. Was there any particular reason to move your user / user talk pages to that name, and back again ? __label__3 This is basic C++ syntax. Are you learning from a [good introductory book](http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 388242 / the - definitive - c - book - guide - and - list)?__label__3 I saw today (thanks for explaining to me) that you reverted twice (i wasnt even aware i changed it twice) my edit on <url>. Maybe I have totally no clue about what that edit - status is about, but isnt it true that the presentation is over, and done ? __label__3  " Office actions will be clearly indicated both during and after to prevent ambiguities." -- <url>.

How do you deal with an editor, who ' s soul mission is to undo ALL <url> across a vast number of articles ? __label__3 What do you mean by "scalable"? Would running a separate thread to monitor each agent and to actively flag if there were no heartbeat for ten seconds be "scalable"?__label__3 I have no intention to prolong the discussion, but this has been simply to demonstrate that there may be different opinions. Since people have already advised you on numerous occasions to refrain from reverting, why not discussing first, rather than deleting straight away ? __label__3 15 boards per hour is four minutes per board. How long does the PICkit 2 take to program your part ? __label__3 I did not have intention to put the username signature into any article. Where did you find it ? __label__3 I guess we could but this seems like such a small subset of a problem that I ' m sure it could be solved easily enough in the database. Setting up sphinx / solr or any other indexer just seems a bit like overkill ? __label__3 It ' s still not clear. Does the URL have to contain `.com`?__label__3 Yeah right, I use android AsyncTask. Does it make different ? __label__3 lol, turns out the photo isn ' t his either. Any ideas from here ? __label__3 In the fnv _ func, the type of p [ i] is char, what will happen with h after the first iteration?

What terminal ? __label__3 Amusingly, the link to NACHA format you provide is to a tool that, apparently, can be used for the task you need to do. Have you tried it ? __label__3 @Matt Sorry about the edit, maan. Out of curiosity, why don ' t you want the spoiler block ? __label__3 Why doesn ' t it compile? What errors are you getting ? __label__3 Of that <url> I just went down and overhauled, you and two <url> <url> were the only (active) Texans I could imagine being interested in getting the ball for a <url> rolling. Interested ? __label__3 I ' m confused. Can I just edit it, or should I ask here first ? __label__3 If a page is deleted, and then recreated as something different, can the original be recovered with the original history?

Or does it not show that ? __label__3 Hmm..I was not aware that a year had to pass for ''anyone'' to request an appeal for Everyking. Prior to today, when did they ever say this ? __label__3 I ' ve read everything again, and I still think it ' s the right decision.

How does the typical office desk of a professor look like ? __label__3 do you want an answer to, *how do I do this with `zmv`?* or an answer to, *how can mass rename files from one extension to another?*__label__3 What are you doing with the XML? Reason I ask is this, instead of wrapping the XML library and exposing wrapper classes to your code, why don ' t you implement a simpler object model for what you are storing in the XML and expose that - then have a clean interface which can persist / extract that object model from the XML ? __label__3 You are just saying that <math>frac { f ( x+h)-f ( x)}{h}</math> is continuous at <math>h=0</math>, but that is not the same as saying <math>f'(x)</math> is continuous. Do you have any references ? __label__3 1900 articles! Is this a full - time job ? __label__3 Could you show more context? Where is `$form` coming from ? __label__3 Is eclipse asking about missing jars or missing source folders ? Are you maven ?__label__3 We do have "don ' t do" there.

Did you receive any error message ? __label__3 Just so I understand correctly the censoring issue: When you dilute a sample the concentration of a compound falls so low that the test instrument can fail to detect its presence. Is that an accurate re - phrasing of the censoring problem ? __label__3 Splash I added the info about his age dispute, the user then removed my edits, called me a liar and added a whole bunch of other deliberately negative POV edits to the article.

Do you think everything is now sorted so I can beep Brain Boulton ? __label__3 Here ' s a question for you: I have seen "kvatrutafl" identified as <url>.

(Names of places which have articles in Wikipedia) Since no editions are permitted how will the missing names be completed ?__label__3 It ' s not obvious to me that there is sufficient information to solve the problem. How do we know that the answer does not depend on the particular way in which the child crawls ? __label__3 kindly explain why did you remove my changes. The added links were quite relevant and informational, also The Vanguard Group and Hi5, why do you revert my edits ? __label__3 @Laurence Gonsalves: Oh? What, then, is the ubiquitous _C string_ if it is not a string ? __label__3 It ' s first choice in mine version. But what is this Custom there ? __label__3 And, by the way, shouldn ' t there have to be actual copyright VIOLATIONS (not just a lack of a machine - readable tag) to delete a photograph?

The browser ? __label__3 I can ' t replicate this at all. Maybe try flipping the hardware switch or Fn+F5 (or whatever your key is)?__label__3 Yes, it certainly could be. But why thre read() does not realize immediately there ' s nothong to read, but waits for 1 / 2 seconds ? __label__3 @karianna - I ' m using Subversion; hope discussing little tech / programming won ' t make this closed! :-) Please let me know whether I need to post a question in SO asking how to merge log comment to particular class? :-)__label__3 Your bot ' s edits aren ' t being marked as such; that is, they still appear in my watchlist when I choose to hide bot edits. Could you do something about this ? __label__3 I just checked several of the most important Russian writers and painters and was shocked to see that some very important ones (and also well - known in the Western world) are as yet not in scope of the Biographies Project (think <url>, <url>, <url>, <url>, <url> and <url>).

Please explain: A question about apple filesystems belongs on superuser ? __label__3 Might get better responses from Stack Overflow (http://ww . stackoverflow . com/) - even though this applies to your games it ' s really programming.

Have you ever been to Virginia ? __label__3 Wait, what ' s the COI? Was this on the fringe noticeboards ? __label__3 Also I do not think that the constraint if you have a choice you always prefer right to forward, and forward to left is well - defined.

Do people think the answer to this is dependent on conventions that vary substantially from language to language ? __label__3 Many people have mentioned this mythical facillity - I ' ve never found it, and assumed it was only available to sysops, which I am not. Is this the case ? __label__3 @Robusto: That sounds very plausible. Do you think that contrasts with your other two examples ? __label__3 I tagged it since most appears to be in Chinese, so I canu2019t understand it, but by what I can gather the user is trying to accuse the Chinese government of a cover up.

So.. what ? __label__3 Does the array contain negative numbers, or only positive numbers? Does it contain zeros ? __label__3 Can you explain why you need a text file dump of a bunch of synonyms? Why not just use [synonym . com](http://ww . synonym . com / synonyms/) ?__label__3 You lost me J. I did the edits because I remember you telling me that repeating things that are already in the wiki - link is unneeded and / or redundant. Do you not recall that instance ? __label__3 I ' m sorry, but I don ' t see how my edit makes it harder to find the book. Could you please explain ? __label__3 There ' s no apparent reason for the warnings to be caused by the `\cite` commands. Can you please add the exact warning message that you are getting ? __label__3 So you ' re trying to use remote debugging? Have you set that up in VS 2010 ? __label__3 @Rory ah, but you ' re still talking about general usage scenarios. What about the specific use case - connected to the Internet, but no outgoing connections except to Windows Update ? __label__3 Hi. Not complaining, but why did you remove the category "high schools in california" from this article ? __label__3 This is working perfectly fine for me. are the contents of @SPICE _ FILES unique and are you writing anything other than ".end" ?__label__3 does it have to be a C# example? can it be vb . net ? __label__3 Where are you executing the query? Do you get any errors ? __label__3 Is "sub edit" called as a method? ie "$thing->edit ()"?__label__3 But I don ' t know anything about central europe.

Perhaps we should both focus on the many positive things to do rather than the very occasional misbehavior ? __label__3 Please make your question more understandable. And provide an example.. What sentence is not clear for you ? __label__3 @Tal Galili: http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Love _ means _ never _ having _ to _ say _ you % 27re _ sorry. (My favorite is the line from *What ' s Up, Doc?*)__label__3 Is this just a confused marketing statement? Or can you point us to a product that does this or a use of this notion in the wild ? __label__3 And where do you host the script? In a VPS ? __label__3 did you miss "word1 word3 word2" and some others combinations on purpose ? edit: ie do you mean combinations in the mathematical sense (that is to say, not a permutation)?__label__3 Well, I ' d have to disagree with you about adding animators. If I ' m not mistaken, manga artists and comic book editors both participate in the writing of the books, so I could see their inclusion, but don ' t animators just do the artwork ? __label__3 I have an e - mail set up in wikipedia, but I normally keep it disabled. Are you online right now ? __label__3 Please add the replys as comments to the answer, this way the user gets notified of the reply. Just to make sure, both of the videos use only the baseline profile of AVC ? __label__3 Thanks for your reply. You are, I take it, aware that you can be blocked for disruptive editing ? __label__3 Maybe you can clarify what you meant by "legal action" then? Perhaps you just meant as opposed to illegal actions ? __label__3 Since I have no purpose I don ' t need to use wikipedia, so can you change my username to <url> (<url>)??__label__3 This sounds like the questioner is asking how to switch gears smoothly, and is concerned in particular with letting go of the bars? @solomongaby, can you please confirm and edit your question to be clearer ? __label__3 I reverted <url> as it complicated my normal routine archiving of all the discussions on my talk page. Could you please refrain from this kind of edit in future ? __label__3 Isn ' t it a graph problem? Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path ? __label__3 Wikipedia has a strict rule about ''not'' simultaneously filing an article in both a parent category ''and'' a subcategory of the same parent. Could you please ''not'' add <url> to a category if it ' s already in <url>, <url> or a country - specific record labels category ? __label__3  " Book" in question is A4 or thereabouts, and runs to a grand total of 32 pages including covers. It does state that it is a journal of SIAS, No 18 / 1988. There ' s not much to choose between the two templates though, is there ? __label__3 Any progress I ' m having similar problems with the result from a query. Should we add an Idea on ESRIs website that we can vote up ? __label__3 please, explain better what do you mean with "Steam games". Any game distributed through Steam or some specific games only ? __label__3 @Soviut I ' ve added your changes, however I ' m getting banned by IP when I click two questions in the link above. Is there some way of avoiding this ? __label__3 Something to check: click "My preferences" at the top of the screen. Under "User profile", in the "Basic information" box, what does it say in the line "Member of groups"?__label__3 What were the four universities? Drexel, Duquesne, Maine - Orono and ?__label__3 I notice that, for some reason, you have been undertaking some minor 'modifications' to the article John Musgrave & Sons. Do you have some special interest in Bolton firms, or some particular knowledge on this firm ? __label__3 Is this the headset microphone or microphone - microphone? Or could you link to the product ? __label__3 Regex is not good at manipulating XML. Using XSLT, why performance should be scary ? __label__3 Newer SIM cards should have anti - tamper protection that makes it useless if you try to clone it. Have you already succeeded in cloning one ? __label__3 I supose it would be cool to avoid using same person in different nationality infoboxes for the simple reason that for non - involved people may seem confusing. However, it does sem that we canxb4t treat this matter as sportspeople contracts ("''If you have a contract with one team, you canxb4t play for another''.") so if really necessary, the exceptions of having the same person in more infoboxes can happend.. right ? __label__3 IsPalindrome is a useful function? For whom? ;-)__label__3 Nothing. Remember Kevin Mitnick and Bernie S.?__label__3 I know this is a bit obvious, but when you fry them, do you squish them with the skillet at all as they ' re cooking ? __label__3 I suppose that there is nothing to be done about it, but Jamesd1 just buried a direct question to him, about compromise, under a long discussion about Alice Bailey ' s supposed religious views (Bailey was not a Christian) that belong on a Bailey discussion forum, not on this article ' s talk page. Does not Wikipedia have some way to resolve editing situations in which editors refuse to compromise and end the arguing ? __label__3 And I ' m asking for YOUR help, DrachenFyre, to control this vandal <url>'s changes to <url> and <url>. What do we do with this nut ? __label__3 I ' m not reaching the point of your question. Aren ' t you being able to deserialize the data ? __label__3 Have you received the 1972 Encyclopedia of PNG you mentioned during the discussion about <url>? Was there a detailed entry for Dagora ? __label__3 He ' s returned to the same trolling he was doing years ago. If he really wants to edit in good faith, why not insist he make some non - controversial edits for a while instead of immediately restarting a two year old edit war ? __label__3 Are you asking about preparing a presentation (e . g. using Beamer), or preparing a "notesheet" that is simply a guide for yourself as you ' re talking ? __label__3 It ' s pretty unclear. Where do you want to add an overlay view without using a `UIImagePickerController`?__label__3 I ' m going to say that this should probably be put on http://serverfault . com . I believe you are wanting to set up Virtual Access Points ? __label__3 my problem is not really to solve this bug but to know how to find the line of a bug in a proxy. I don ' t think you need additional information about it, isn ' t it ?__label__3 I ' m not seeing evidence of <url> grudge. Can you show me the evidence ? __label__3 I ' m sorry. Did I hurt your feelings ? __label__3 Somehow..we appear to be the only administrators updating the queues on DYK and I ' m still learning at this. How can we make the process more efficient / better ? __label__3 I happened to notice this odd edit here: <url>. A weird thing for an anon IP to do ? __label__3 I saw you added <nowiki><person></nowiki> to an article. What does that do ? __label__3 I can understand wanting to use less than O ( n) space, but O ( n) time seems odd, since you need to do something about n characters individually. Do you mean less than O ( n) time once the stream is stopped ? __label__3 Works fine here. Have you tried to download it again ? __label__3 Still fuzzy. :) Could you please rephrase - what does `twenty ten shows` and `new one shows the html template` mean ? __label__3 Did you read the census appendix that I have provided? It itself says not to trust it ? __label__3 On an unrelated note, the bot is listing arbitrary breaks in AfDs as separate open AfDs. Any way to prevent that from happening ? __label__3 @Lars: Youtube and Facebook run on PHP and they most probably have more than 1500 servers. Can you enlighten us on why you do not consider Python and PHP suitable ?__label__3 What do you mean by "in GMT format"? What ' s the type of the Added property ? __label__3 Is your username Davshul? When would you be online ? __label__3 Why is it necessary for there to be no data there? Is it because you think it ' s faster that way ? __label__3 Well, which is the given name in <url>? And which is the surname ? __label__3 In its current form, the question is too open ended and basically does not provide enough information for a relevant answer. Could you explain your situation a bit more ? __label__3 it is up on their website. Do you know how to put it on the south wales scorpions infobox thing on the wikipedia page ? __label__3 clear about when the inverse exists. Is there a formal theorem that would apply ? __label__3 Please answer the question fully. Which other accounts have you edited as ? __label__3 I don ' t understand at all. What is "link a certain image in my project to a certain page"?__label__3 What happens if you try other alternative keyboard? Do you lose them as well or is it just Swype ? __label__3 Ok. Thanks TTGL. Are you like my handler or mentor now ? __label__3 You removed the reviews and their cites from <url> and left a summary saying use them in album pages, of which there are none for this band (just a few singles). Since I don ' t plan to make any, where would this information and the logo be appropriate ? __label__3 It ' s interesting that the "alternative medicine" bit was inserted without discussion on 4 Dec. 2010, by my old friend <url>. What ' s that about ? __label__3 and the sign _ in works with safari ? after a logout ?__label__3 ah - not thinking there. I ' ve left Mackle though for now - is he back at Hearts ? __label__3 Sorry, but which talk page? I came across the graphic at <url> - is there another ? __label__3 Any particular part? Or do you want us to read the documentation to you ? __label__3 Who do you think will be the next president? Do you have a favorite yet ? __label__3 JJG, I am reading books on the issue and gathering sources. Ixb4m finishing another one today, so I touth about asking you which ones would you recoment me ? __label__3 Stupid question perhaps, but what do the numbers in "25 / 15 / 15" and "10 / 7 / 7" represent ? __label__3 I ' m a bit puzzled what ' s going on with this template, and the two articles that include it. This should really just be one merged article, with redirects as appropriate, no ? __label__3 @Patric so what about your implementation? Did you used exactly those algorithms presented in this book, without changing anything ? __label__3 Have you considered performing a simple test measuring how long it takes your cold water to boil versus warm water ? __label__3 So you want to be able to specify a footnote that will be attached to _every_ occurrence of a given word in your document, and will appear on every page where the word does? Should all these footnotes have different numbers ? __label__3 I was thinking about bringing that up. I wonder if this is the first time someone ' s beat me to it ? __label__3 You say sorted but your example isn ' t sorted using normal lexical ordering. Is this a mistake ? __label__3 You added to the Order of Victoria and Albert page that no awards were given out after the death of Queen Victoria. According to the <url> she became the tSovereign of the Order in 1952. Is this just because the order was never officially scrapped ?__label__3 There ' s a lot of different software. Worth making this community wiki ? __label__3 You don ' t - you run a callback function (like @Alex ' s answer) or something fancier like `jQuery . Deferred` (my answer). But your question is unclear - could you show us some more code ? __label__3 How is the complex number c given to the Turing machine? Are you considering in terms of Turing machines over real / complex numbers ? __label__3 The same as you already wrote in your first example. What should the result be ? __label__3 Regarding <url> I ' m not aware of disagreeing with you about a lot of stuff. What are you referring to ? __label__3 My concern is that you are proceeding at such a rate of knots that it going to be difficult to later unpick and I can see some disagreement on this. Why not seek a consensus ? __label__3 the use of low level code does not guarantee that there will be no failure in its execution, so the validation tests should always be made. Your implementation does not have any report of failure ? __label__3 Bumpity bump. Anyone else have any thoughts on this ? __label__3 I ' ve heard rumors of Pb - Sn solder being incompatible with certain RoHS PCB finishes. Does anyone have real data about this ? __label__3 Iu2019ve noticed youu2019ve been removing links in see also sections that have links elsewhere in the article. Iu2019m curious why; doesnu2019t help navigation to have a consolidated list of related articles ? __label__3 PS maybe the same in 16 languages? + shortlist of words ? __label__3 Interesting -- strong support promised without any reference to <url>, <url> and <url>? Not good form, eh ? __label__3 Is your interest of theoretical or practical nature? If practical, are existing tools like http://lalescu . ro / liviu / fet/ inadequate for you problem ? __label__3 seems I have done that just had my set to "false". Does that make difference ? __label__3 Depends on your PHP experience. What is yours ? __label__3 You said you were promoting them, but, um.. they aren ' t listed at <url>, they still say they ' re FPOCs on their talk pages, etc, etc. Should we consider them featured or not ? __label__3 But the Bayes formula says something like the sum / something, is it enough to know those probabilities? Could you please post an example ? __label__3 That seems to be right since it still debugs in IE, but I cleared everything (see above). What else can I clear ? __label__3 I added a contains spoiler tag because I didn ' t know about any secret mission. Maybe we could use this tag for questions that contain spoilers on the side ? __label__3 Why do you have one currency to select? You are converting to the selected currency or from the selected currency ? __label__3 Richiez, if you are a surgeon, there ' s a good chance that Intuitive Surgical would bring a robot to your home or office for free so that you could test drive it without further obligation. What have you got to lose ? __label__3 It looks like the category functioning works. Can we get an alert to render instead of the default missing parameter <nowiki>{{1}}</nowiki> behaviour ? __label__3 diagram? Was that an overzealous copy paste or is the diagram on its way? :)__label__3 Why don ' t you start from `axb` parts of size of 1 and randomly join adjacent parts? Is there some criterion parts have to satisfy ? __label__3 I ' m sorry, but I can ' t understand what exactly you are looking for. What is your independent variable (the function), the dependent variables (the input values) and the parameters are ? __label__3 i just want to know the logic of how this can be done. or if anybody can show with simple example for this calculation ? __label__3 Judo, Taekwondo, Boxing etc.?__label__3 I kept reading that as "T ( 1) = (2 T ( n))", but I think you meant "T ( 1) = 2, and T ( n) = [..]". Correct ? __label__3 It ' s not the sort of pot I ' ve ever seen used in tea ceremony--they tend to be iron or metal and designed for holding plain hot or cold water rather than tea, which is prepared directly in bowls. Perhaps the <url> page ? __label__3 Ditto. Are you claiming that <url> is not a credible source on Wikipedia ?__label__3 I see you ' ve given her a code name in <url>. Where did you run across this tidbit ? __label__3 Soz about that then- on second thoughts it does look a little pinky, but then like you say it ' s probably the light. Can you tell I ' m not used to that much sun ? __label__3 Thanks. Is Brazil4Linux doing anything particully bad right now ? __label__3 Well, is there any kind of deadline? I guess I had to hurry ? __label__3 Advantages over what? What ' s your alternative ? __label__3 Why 2 is not the answer? Do you need any number or the largest number or just found, not found will do ? __label__3 Sorry, the question was not 'Is this correct, or what is correct?' it was 'Why does this work?'__label__3 Are you actually wanting it to become "part of" the standard library on your system, or are you just wanting it to work in your project? To phrase it another way, what is the actual problem you have right now using the code you posted ? __label__3 I ' m slightly unknowledgeable about CGI, seeing as it is stoneage technology I haven ' t used for almost 10 years, but.. Isn ' t that how CGI works? Like, per definition ? __label__3 @Tim Why not posting this as an answer? Please ? __label__3 In every case of the FROM clause you used, the table name is immediately after a 'FROM '. Why not just use that to parse ? __label__3 OK @Juan - the meta question has established unequivocally that questions like this are definitely allowed. Could you "un - close" it now ? __label__3 To quote Barak Obama: Yes We Can! Now, what have you tried and where have you failed ? __label__3 ''Question'' to both of you. Would it be considered canvassing to notify every participant of the AfD of the discussion at <url> and ask for their input ? __label__3 nobody ;[. What ' s the problem ? __label__3 Confused with your notation. What is the format for one vector ? __label__3 argmax on what? A function, a dictionary ? __label__3 When would any WP policy e . g. <url> require a change in citation style ? __label__3 Was there an exception thrown? Some type of error encountered ? __label__3 How would this be possible? How would you be able to link the subscribers on Identi to tweeters ? __label__3 Secondly, please show me where Maynard Smith credits this idea to Haldane. Have you read the Grafen paper ? __label__3 The problem remains that I don ' t know where to turn to educate myself further on the matter. For instance, where would I find the Tao - Green paper you mention in the article ? __label__3 Hi Kumioko, with regards to <url>, I ' m not really seeing how <url>, a British WWII admiral is part of the US wikiproject? Were you using a category as your basis ? __label__3 Okay, I thought it was a mistake, but I wasn ' t sure. Do you normally eat dinner after 8 PM ? __label__3 I never saw his press conference. Is there a clip of it online ? __label__3 I agree that terms like Australian Formula 1 need an explanation but isn ' t that why we link the term to the Australian Formula 1 page? Do we need to disrupt the flow of the article to explain a term which is already explained on the linked page ? __label__3 A background image for what? How is the image being used ? __label__3 Can you specify "sometimes"? When does it work and when not ? __label__3 Do you mean absolutely definitely prime, or most likely prime for all practical purposes? Are these primes going to be used for security purposes, or something else ? __label__3 Before I respond, I have a question: do you have anything that might be considered a conflict of interest regarding this subject? Specifically, are you Jory Rabinovitz or a member of his immediate family or friends ? __label__3 Still wondering and hoping. Rather not ? __label__3 Where exactly are the tests? /forum / tests / tests . py, or /forum / tests . py ? __label__3 which instances of figure did you change (i . e. which lines)?__label__3 You blocked <url> earlier today: now we have <url> (<url>) (<url>). He ' s only done one nonsense page so far: is the name similarity enough to block as a sock ? __label__3 You are able to read it here <url>. Wondering if this is worthy of sign post ? __label__3 @Milo: I ' m confused about why you have a non - overrideable function call a virtual function rather than directly calling the virtual function. Is there a reason for this ? __label__3 By "doesn ' t work" do you mean that you left off the `self.` that would make the various values part of the object? Can you provide any error message or traceback ? __label__3 could you add some code? does your `<object>` tag have an `id`?__label__3 Can you explain what "abandoned" means in the context of the PROD on <url>? The article was recently created, so I don ' t think that ' s the reference ? __label__3 SiegeX, what do you mean? Means, instead of rows+columns, I should change it to rows only ? __label__3 I would, of course, follow the advice the ER gave you! Can you please reformat this question to be less of a discussion - board - style post, so it ' s asking a single question ? __label__3 Wait, Rob got blocked again? Why ? __label__3 I feel that way just from working all week, are you sure it ' s from the riding ? __label__3 It states on the page that it features her, they sample the song, and were going to try and get her to take part in the video..

I thought the Zatanna one got removed ? __label__3 Is this on a server you control (ie. can set sv _ cheats on)?__label__3 so the string *can* start with "USD" and / or "$" followed by digits; optionally followed by "," or ".", followed by more digits ? __label__3 What exactly do you think `*k` should be? What would `k` point to ? __label__3 He ' s still at it, and stating that we can ' t stop him as he has not got a static IP. Can you at least block him for now ? __label__3 Or am i going against the grain here - should i really be using sessions instead? Are sessions the more 'blessed' way of doing things in struts2 ? __label__3 Ok, so [1 , 2,..,N] is not allowed because it is a run itself. Then how about [N,..,2 , 1]?__label__3 Also, the aim "using the minimum number of examiners for the minimum amount of time" is not too clear. How many examiners are you willing to add to subtract a unit of time ? __label__3 I know there has been an issue with wrong Brazilian chart data being added lately. Is <url> adding the correct data, or could it be the same user with a dynamic IP address ? __label__3 Can you please be more specific instead of saying 'often said'. Can you cite references, and also expand on why the issue is relevant ?__label__3 Your function doesn ' t actually *return* anything. When you say "it just returns the matrix", what do you mean ? __label__3 I found an autoblock and cleared it. Can you edit now ? __label__3 Also, what ' s your workflow? Are you shooting raw ? __label__3 Dlaczego usunu0105u0142eu015b ze sku0142adu Kas ( z?)aka ? __label__3 Try installing a JRE (e . g., `apt - get install openjdk - 6 - jre`), possibly the one from the 10 . 04 repo, _before_ trying the full upgrade. Does it work ? __label__3 Hi, why did you remove <url>, <url>, <url> with <url> ? Do you think we ' d better put them into article directly ?__label__3 @Tony: I guessed as much (do you write some of the MSdN content?), but how does it relate to the fileStream and / or responseStream and the overall solution ? __label__3 About 3 , 500 hits per day at the moment, and the article is terrible. Could you lend a hand ? __label__3 GBA = Game Boy Advanced.

Also, can someone with sufficient rep please add the "punctuation" tag ? __label__3 What is your question? What about your sample code doesn ' t work as you want ? __label__3 Hi - there are a few issues that I ' ve pointed out at the nomination page. Also, why does your sign link to the talkpage of <url>?__label__3 @Stephan I understand the question as referring to an univariate distribution, hence one variable with multiple observations. Am I missing something ? __label__3 Sorry, I have to ask: is Taxonomy module enabled ? __label__3 This looks so much like when I try to mount my USB (not encrypted). What do you get from dmesg ? __label__3 Is it something I can fix myself easily then? Or does it require some esoteric knowledge which Local Bike shop owners gain through years of study ? __label__3 I ' ve never even questioned this before, but now you mention it why is it OK for boards but not for knives ? __label__3 You cannot compress most of media data as it ' s already compressed.

And don ' t you have to move the talk page too ? __label__3 Yep. Ain ' t it fun when we agree ? __label__3 Why is ''<url>'' a better name for this page than ''<url>'', which has now been made a redirect page? Is it not standard to speak of "great circle distance"?__label__3 Your problem is coming up with a practically useful definition of "centre". What ' s your application ? __label__3 This editor, blocked as a sock of <person>, is currently requesting an unblock, and appears to want your particular attention. Would you mind dropping by ? __label__3 Heey. Whaat ' s wrong with my question ? __label__3 Hi, just returned from a longer vacation where I was 100% offline and can look at it soon if it is not too late. What is the deadline ? __label__3 I see no problem with e - mail being used as a verb. If you can mail a [paper] letter, why can ' t you [e-]mail an [electronic] letter ? __label__3 Just asking one quick question since it ' ll probably be asked at RfA. Do you know the difference between a block and a ban ? __label__3 Could you please look at your dmesg, try to find any radeon related line.

Do you mean to make it the background image, or to drag and drop a file on the desktop ? __label__3 If something already exists. Why would I take the overhead of maintanance ?__label__3 I really want to know some context for this question. Why would you ever need a word for someone who loves frogs ? __label__3 Spam filter? Do you mean your post was reverted ? __label__3 I find it hard to believe one editor (even one so prolific as RickK) can have much of an effect overall. Do contributors on either side have any (non - anecdotal) evidence that suggests otherwise ? __label__3 Hmm, there was a 7th <url> - but someone deleted him from <url> after removing the Prod. Is that kocher ? __label__3 Could you please explain to me what the buttons do? How do you "Not accept" a change, that ' s what..you revert it, don ' t you..?__label__3 You mean battery power?

What am I missing ? __label__3 I ' ve removed the reference, but if you are attached, you can put it back. Can we remove these comments ? __label__3 Feeling tired, stressed, not clear? The talk page for Antractica might be just that (although I have alerted another admin before you) straw on the camels back ?__label__3 @gooshgoosh: Youve left out the most important detail: what are you using (programming language, software, etc.) to do the translation ? __label__3 At a glance, I can ' t see anything wrong with the code (I have an app that uses UIImagePNGRepresenation the same way you do). What exactly is going wrong ? __label__3 @Jacques: “M is the disjoint union of the level set approximations to the complement of the Mandelbrot set.” Yes, if by disjoint union you mean discriminated union (“disjoint union” sometimes means the usual union of pairwise disjoint sets, and I want to avoid this ambiguity). Have I ever suggested otherwise ? __label__3 Which end are you talking about? the part that plugs into the car for the part that plugs into the phone ? __label__3 Really? It wasn ' t that often was it ? __label__3 Sorry , but i dont know where are these project properies. Could someone tell me ? __label__3 I just reverted your edits to the <url> page, because you seemed to make a number of major changes without providing an explanation for them, except the word 'Infobox' in your edit summary. Can you provide any references for the changes ? __label__3 Did you read Q & A QA1703? http://developer . apple . com / library / ios/#qa / qa1703/_index . html % 23//apple _ ref / doc / uid / DTS40010193 it looks like you took that and decided to iterate through views instead of windows, is there a reason ? __label__3 I notice you have cleared the last update but the new one is not showing up on the front page on my PC. Is there some reason for that that you know of ? __label__3 Do you mean, when you break into the debugger and step through the code the image disappears? Or when running the form in DEBUG mode ? __label__3 what environment / operating system do you use? (Mac, PC, iPhone, etc?)__label__3 I did that already, a while back. Is there another one to block ? __label__3 Exactly! If I am to implement another interpreter using R, do parsing tools exist ? __label__3 You created <url>, there is already a page that similar <url>. Why don ' t you mix 2 articles together ? __label__3 Is your POST tag variable set? Is that query returning rows ? __label__3 @Archana: Do you mean http://code . google . com / p / zxing/? What exactly did you download, and what code are you using ? __label__3 What you really need to do if you want an article on 'Do Anything Nice' is to establish its notability. Can you find multiple non - trivial mentions in reliable sources that refer to it ? __label__3 What language? Could you use an existing regular expression library ? __label__3 Hi. Why did you blank the redirect at <url>?__label__3 Cannot implicitly convert type 'object' to 'System . Web . UI . DataVisualization . Charting . SeriesChartType'. An explicit conversion exists (are you missing a cast?)__label__3 i ’ ll come back to you on this one. Do you have Logic (express / pro)?__label__3 I see. So what should I do with this sockpuppet ? __label__3 When you say, "doesn ' t support" are you referring to a strict XHTML schema? Can you use a looser definition ? __label__3 ..This may just mean that I ' m willing to expand my view of the word "ancestor" arbitrarily far, although finding a ribosome - like organism sans nucleic acids and a replicating RNA - like organism sans proteins would probably break it. On the other hand, it ' d be really cool and help explain abiogensis, so, who ' d really care ? __label__3 Can you tell me if there are _any_ other constraints? Like a finite set of possible values ? __label__3 I don ' t understand what you mean exactly. Isn ' t that just some kind of minimum spanning tree ? __label__3 Title could be a bit better. Just to be clear are you asking "What is the difference between C++ and Java on the Android Phone?"__label__3 Hi. Can you tell me why it ' s necessary for the article on the Greek goddess to be disambiguated, when <url> has only been designated as such for under 24 hours ? __label__3 I ' m curious, are you stopping at characters? Or will you eventually move onto season pages and the main page itself ? __label__3 P . S. What 11 - year - old Swiss case ? __label__3 Have to agree with @Aubergine here. Why not make us a place to find hints about getting through some of the levels ? __label__3 Mou017ce dawniej sekundnik w ogxf3le nie istniau0142? A "naciu0105g" czy nie byu0142 rxf3wnieu017c uu017cywany do ''nastawiania''<person>nie tylko do "nakru0119cania" ("''winding''")<person>zegarka ? __label__3 It ' s complex enough to not be taught easily or well, if you prefer. Anyway, the question is more about "do we know about a less worst solution"?__label__3  " Redirecting is blanking" would be more accurate. Or maybe "redirecting is redirecting"?__label__3 I am not sure a staggered array is a way to go here, what if you need to do something like `{}_3 F _ 2 \ left(\begin { matrix } a - b+1& &b+a - 1& &c+d - 1\\&d - a+1& &e+d - b - 1&\end { matrix}\middle ; z \ right)`, even if you make the the array tighter, there will still be a lot of space left. How about something like this: `{}_3 F _ 2 \ left(\begin { matrix } a \ quad b \ quad c\\d \ quad e \ end { matrix}\middle ; z \ right)`?__label__3 Which discussion are you referring to? On which article ' s talk page ? __label__3 I have applied to become an admin but no one has voted? Why is this ? __label__3 I ' ve wondered about this, too. Can you make a display of an array of LEDs and then detect touch by using the same LEDs to sense reflected light from a finger ? __label__3 Why do you change from `print` to `printf` when you print to a filehandle? (Also, why are you still using global `FILEHANDLE`s instead of lexically scoped variables?)__label__3 Who is authorized to perform sockpuppet checks? Is there an automated service for doing it ? __label__3 please, can you explain what do you mean? I ask question and I need the solution if you have.. Is there is any problem with my question ? __label__3 Either way, the whole point of the question was to see a concrete mathematical proof. Instead of just saying it is so, can you please show how it is so, such that I can learn more ? __label__3 654987 is an integer, not a double. Did you mean something else ? __label__3 Needs `homework` tag ? You might also want to specify the programming language, at the very least, and perhaps mention what you ' ve tried so far ?__label__3 She did so in Switzerland. What makes you think a photo that was deemed not to be a "work" in Switzerland was not a work in the U . S., where the threshold of originality is much lower ? __label__3 <url>. Do you think it has any chance ? __label__3 I ' ve compiled with TeX Live 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 / pretest and had no errors. Would you please add the list of file that you obtain by adding `\listfiles` at the start of the input ? __label__3 Are these links stored in a database? How are these links generated ? __label__3 I have now created <url> and <url>. I wonder if a similar template may be warranted for listifying (CfL)?__label__3 It ' s a strange question. Can you rephrase it ? __label__3 how to use drush? or database? please help me more..?__label__3 I don ' t understand the problem exactly. Is the input a string s and a regular expression r, and the problem is to decide whether s is in the language defined by the regular expression r ? __label__3 Are the objects with the same name, the same objects? Or do they differ in some other property ? __label__3 I find the documentation for Net::HTTP pretty hard to navigate and understand compared to curl ' s manpage. Is there something wrong with trying to delegate work from a Ruby program to another unix program ? __label__3 Posted to <url>. What category are you talking about ? __label__3 This is actually a question about recovering deleted files, it doesn ' t really make any differene that they are images. Perhaps would fit better on superuser ? __label__3 As you can tell from my user page I do like art. I noticed you talking about a film ambassador on WikiProject Film (An project that I am active on) and I was wondering what is the main goals of film ambassador ? __label__3 He ' s clearly beyond the pale of Wikiquette, farther than nearly anything I ' ve seen, what with this AFD thing and the claim that you and Mkdw "blanked" the talkpage and so on; see my latest on <url> which ironically enough I posted just before he began his latest onslaught; the US edition of Entertainment Tonight used H . N. tonight - to refer to Sundance, without mentioning the Canadian context at that festival, which of course the Canadian edition which follows it ''did''..but I could only chuckle because the Hollywood machine behind Entertainment Tonight, or that show ' s writers anyway, seem to use the term to mean anywhere in the cold; not even north of the border..anyway, seems to me that Yellowsnow needs a big spanking; but which area of <url> is the right one to use ? __label__3 @Gaim: Better, but you still haven ' t stated what OS this is for, or what programming environment you ' re using. And where did the address of _printf come from ?__label__3 I ' d personally be keeping my seven million records in a database, and letting the SQL Server team worry about how to optimize memory usage. Is there some reason why that ' s not an option ? __label__3 The layout for this sample code seems incorrect: why do you have a larger gap between the second and the third columns? Shouldn ' t it be between the 3rd and 4th columns instead ? __label__3 <person>, whom you blocked for 3RR, is contesting their block with what appear to be defensible arguments. Would you like to comment ? __label__3 Now I realize the point of the discussion on meta about SI units. I said it about CGS units, but this works for these also: should I cry ? :p__label__3 So as you ' re iterating through an array you want to remove objects from it. How do you expect to keep track of what ' s in the array if you ' re changing that same array on every iteration ? __label__3 Hi there, I was just wondering why you edited my user page to remove the "you have old messages" banner. I agree that "you have new messages" jokes are annoying, but what ' s wrong with old ? __label__3 What user list? The one I linked to ? __label__3 Are you asking for a tool that does this? Or an idea how to do this in python ? __label__3 @Norman: I need to wrap lots of legacy API so that I can call it from lua, so a automaic way is a MUST. Do you have any other recommendation ? __label__3 One oddity is that the Library of Congress isn ' t officially the U . S. national library; there are only national libraries in Medicine and Agriculture. Do you compare specialized libraries ? __label__3 Are you using two sockets with the same port? If so, what is the reason ? __label__3 Fair enough I didn ' t notice that the question was over a year old.. O . K do you even remember what you meant by according to 'my profiler'? What profiler are you using ? __label__3 Must it be dependent? Is GuiceFilter dependent on the container ? __label__3 Why not share your library over Bonjour so she can access your music? Or is there something else you want her to do ? __label__3 isnt `tested` same as `i`. I that case will the `while` ever complete ? __label__3 Why is updating the display immediately an issue? Doesn ' t that make your application seem slower than it actually is ? __label__3 That ' s..weird. What widget is that ? __label__3 I ' ve made it "more pro" by indenting with four spaces to format it as code. Does that count ? __label__3 I was wondering why, within your first few edits, you could participate in AfDs and RfCs, and welcome yourself. Are you a quick learner, or had you been editing anonymously for a while ? __label__3 Transmission monitoring already existed as an answer. Could you please describe more the iTunes watched folder function ? __label__3 I can ' t quite parse your definition of BestE. M and x are sitting outside of their quantification.. also, don ' t you want $M$ to reject inputs which are not in $L$?__label__3 @AndrejaKo - Electrical **fields** are 3 dimensional, yes. But a 3D **wave form**?__label__3 The above username has been indefinitely banned as a phishing account. Now why would they want my login details..?__label__3 <font color="green">''Replied''</font>Yep, that list seems to include ALL ships launched that year, so that work out just fine. By the way, what exactly is the notability of this ship ? __label__3 Hmm, Dev, Jet123 ' s nom doesn ' t really count as your second one, right? I can overwrite it ? __label__3  " with a vary of 0 or 1" doesn ' t really parse into something comprehensible. Rephrase ? __label__3 What do you mean with evenly? Outside evenly brown, or inside evenly done ? __label__3 You ' ve given lots of details, but have not clearly asked a question. Are you interested in knowing why you aren ' t yet appearing in Google search results ? __label__3 Who gives you such error? Did you compile your source using `proc` ?__label__3 What exactly do you mean by "scaling problems"? Is this a problem no matter how high the resolution of the images ? __label__3 I seem to be doing something wrong moving pages to wiktionary, because when I complete a move to <url>, it just stays there as though there were nothing "special" about that move target. What am I doing wrong ? __label__3 Sure, only maybe "legendary" would be possibly better than "magical": the magic isn ' t so much explicitly stated, as hinted, possibly a residual of shamanic influences. What do you think ? __label__3 I ' ve commented on this on the talk page. Could it be resolved there, rather than both of you just reverting each other ? __label__3 Okay. Is that a tacit admonishment of the merger chaos created by user Lucy - marie ? __label__3 I disagree that it fits the description perfectly, but that aside..it doesn ' t indicate that the move is "signature" or that she has ever used it before. Can you find another source that she used the move on another occasion ? __label__3 Hi - I ' m confused. I seem to have lost the note that you say I left on your page ? __label__3 Are you aware that such an app requires root permissions (because it needs to access the sdcard raw without filesystem)? Therefore it will only work on rooted devices ? __label__3 sounds like homework. what have you figured out so far ? __label__3 Interesting. Do you know a proof that those axioms are inconsistent that ' s more elementary (no transfinite induction)?__label__3 Could you post an example TeX file somewhere? Also, which editor do you use, or are you using the Terminal to run pdfLaTeX ? __label__3 I haven ' t received an answer but it wasn ' t reverted. What does this mean ? __label__3 What ' s not actually working? As in, what ' s the exact error you ' re getting ? __label__3 I ' m still not sure what you mean. Do you mean, that there were previous interactions which that edit hints at; or that edit itself implicates you somehow ? __label__3 Doesn ' t work either! If nobody sees a mistake maybe there is a jsf / ajax bug ? __label__3 I can ' t think of a good reason to legitimately remove a watermark. Is there one ? __label__3 Can you share some information about what does not work? What are you expecting that to do ? __label__3 Presumably follows on from your previous question http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 4983820 / excel - functions It was suggested in the answers to that question to use `=MAX ( 0, SUM ( A1 : A5))` to replace a negative number resulting from a formula with zero although the `SUM ( A1 : A5)` part seems to have been given as an example rather than as part of your requirements. Do you actually have any need to look at the range `A1 : A5`?__label__3 @Gajet: Can you explain further? What do you mean by only a loop in which all the cities have distance 1 when you previously mentioned all have distance 20 from each other ? __label__3 The links that I added were detailed images of all the aircraft that was listed in each entry. How does that make it spam ? __label__3 This template is misleading since the subject is a motorcycle racer and the template was made for Formula 1 drivers. Will I have to create a new template for motorcycle racers ? __label__3 Out of interest with the cutting down on sleep do you think that this is sustainable longer term? When you say your other half works part time, how part time is that ? __label__3 @Peter: How about calling it the "necessary"? That ' s discreet, right ? __label__3 Why do you have to use goto for this? And if you want to ensure that both are initialised, isn ' t it easy enough to move both declarations to the top of the function ? __label__3 What articles are you currently working on improving and / or writing? Anything ? __label__3 It looks like a bg image behind an actual image. Are you sure the img isn ' t a broken link ? __label__3 In the title you say .doc but in your question you say .pdf. Which is it ? __label__3 Either way, administrators shouldn ' t be relying on counting how many categories are there for deletion, even if I accept to create the category only one day in advance. Suppose the bot fails to create the category for a day; then, you ' ll see only five categories and do no deletions on that day ? __label__3 Yes I think you can. Did you try creating a new gmail account and apply for a new adsense account?!__label__3 I managed to find full squads for the <url> - among others - but I ' m finding one of the players hard to identify. Do you know who Mura is, on Marseille ' s bench ? __label__3 I suspect Explorer is just ignoring the exceptions. What happens if you try to measure one of the folders that ' s getting an exception using Explorer ? __label__3 what ' s a binding? And in what way is it temporal ? __label__3 I noticed you reverted a US English speller. Shouldn ' t the section <url> actually be spelled ''Tyres'' for internal consistency ? __label__3 I have a question for an audio editing expert. Do you personally know a lot about the science of waves, or do you just deal with the program Audacity ? __label__3 @Mr . 32: That depends. How does that 64 - bit platform implement fseek ? __label__3 The tag for deletion on <url> has been on far past the requisite five days. Would you be able to delete it ? __label__3 I reverted your changes to the section heads at <url>, because I believe that References (when the section contains nothing but book titles and page numbers) is better than Notes, and that Bibliography is the best alternative to References when that header is already in use. But I ' m keen to find out what ' s actually recommended - is there room for my preference ? __label__3 I note the copyvio tag you placed on <url>. How do readers compare the content at the source you specified with the content of the article text you removed ? __label__3 It would seem to me that this category provides no overall benefit to wiki and only serves as another list of organizations which seem to be targeted by the generally negative tone of LGAT articles. Would it make more sense, or be more proper, to include the relevant categories on the individual articles themselves, rather than have an LGAT category ? __label__3 Those files are inaccessible by users with non - jailbroken iPhone / iPads. Do you say you want to guard against users with jailbroken iPhone / iPads ? __label__3 Which part are you trying to debug? Content script, background page, popup ? __label__3 David, your recent edit to <url> includes a mysterious (but tantalizing) sentence fragment "One nice approach", and some extra line breaks. Something got messed up ? __label__3 Isadore .. Well! you have heard of it now :-) Do none of your sources mention it, or do they contradict what Ingram noted as part of the 'Genesis' of the poem ? __label__3 This sounds rather like homework. Could you please flag it as such if that ' s the case ? __label__3 are you sure it is not an 0606 component ( ie. Measurements of the device)?__label__3 At what point is the error thrown? Are you trying something like User . find() or is it through a relationship ? __label__3 Is the server side going to be written in Java or Python? Will a simple database on the server suffice or do you need to perform much game logic ? __label__3 Why are you hashing these values? In other words, are you using the hash to speed lookups (as in a hash table) or are you trying to create an almost - unique digest value for each ? __label__3 Website or WebApp project? Debugging in Cassini or IIS ? __label__3 Distribution of Linux? Python Version ? __label__3 Firebrandt, could you please explain the motivation behind this question, i . e. why are you interested in this question ? __label__3 According to the Microsoft KB ( http://support . microsoft . com / kb / 974396 ) the PresentationHost . exe shouldn ' t depend on which version of IE you ' re using. Is your XBAP compiled to x86 or x64 (specifically)?__label__3 I ' m looking for a diff by yours where you compared administrator corruption to what happened to students during the <url>. Do you happen to know where is that diff ? __label__3 Have you been able to find anything confirming that last result yet? Is it being challenged in court ? __label__3 What does scomposition mean? Do you mean "decomposition"?__label__3 The problem you described is not to be expected in normal circumstances. Can you please add to your question a [minimal working example](http://ww . minimalbeispiel . de / mini - en . html) illustrating the odd bahaviour described ? __label__3 I don ' t see how you can deduce the prototype of a C function with `nm`. To have the prototype mangled in, there, you ' d have to compile the file as C++ and not as C, no ? __label__3 i ' m talking about the idea of protecting from something with such solution. from whom are you protecting ? __label__3 what defines whether elements are acceptable? is the compatibility matrix an input to the algorithm ? __label__3 Can you post a picture? Understanding where the soil and stones are coming from would be the first step to understand how to prevent the soil and stones from building up ? __label__3 Are you running in user mode or kernel mode? Direct manipulation of the IDT is definitely not supported under Windows - what are you trying to do ? __label__3 Gosh, I didn ' t realise it was so many. Would that include 20 batches of DYK hooks (totalling 100 total hooks)?__label__3 Ya. Now I am understanding the problem. But what is the correct way ? __label__3 Do you sign your name using 4 tildes? (<nowiki>~~</nowiki>)?__label__3 What do you mean by coordinates (position on the screen I guess) ? Which layout are you working with ? __label__3 @Toad: Ok. Sorry for the last clarification - does calls to land - line or mobile from Skype client count towards data limit ? __label__3 My edit on <url> was written by me, not copied from a forum. Out of curiousity, which forum copied my post on Wikipedia ? __label__3 @Lorenzo - I think I ' ve heard something along the same lines in the 80s, for Fortran, COBOL, some other less known languages as well. Sorry, all still here :-) On what basis do you make these conclusions ? __label__3 Well I got it to return the correct height by returning findHeight ( node)-1 in my public method. However I just feel like this is sloppy code, any suggestions on a revamp ? __label__3 Tomblin ' s official website says he ' s the 35th Governor. Also, why would Farnsworth be governor & Tomblin not ? __label__3 Sorry, no admin powers. If serious bring to the admin noticeboard ? __label__3 I ' m not sure I get it. How was that missing context ? __label__3 Seems strange to me that you ' d include no less than five tags, and yet not select one that indicate the language you ' re using. Is that some sort of Pascal ? __label__3 Bah, I ' m a little rusty with compilation theory.. Do you know where the conflict is in your grammar ? __label__3 @Sklivvz or MBQ, can you please edit the question title to put it proper English? "Why does the sky change color?"__label__3 In general it isn ' t a great idea to block an IP address indefinitely although this one seems to be pretty static. Maybe reduce to 6 months rather than indefinite ? __label__3 And, btw, are you from Sevilla or its vicinity? How often do you visit Spain ? __label__3 I ' m not sure this is practical. So much game logic uses vector math, you ' d have to either do everything in 3D before converting down to 2D or whatever for rendering, or you ' d have to completely abstract away your vector library - which would surely be impractical ? __label__3 Do your sources have the dates of birth and death for <url>, which I just created? And, while I ' m on the topic, any information regarding his playing career (if applicable)?__label__3 I see your comment "ask user to save his work". Is there a modal window which appears which prevents the shutdown ? __label__3 @user3266: Sorry if this is obvious, but how do one permute the order of the interior vertices and construct another valid Hamiltonian path? Or, only if such property exists then you put it into the equivalence class ? __label__3 i ' m sorry could you explain what you mean, i ' m not sure if i understand. Your saying we should break them into 1x1 tiles ? __label__3 I see that you ' re consistantly reverting vadalism on this page, as well as me. Should we get someone to lock it for awhile ? __label__3 Yes, but the project targets .NET Framework 3 . 5 Client Profile. Shouldn ' t the compiler throw an error if the client profile doesn ' t contain that method ? __label__3 I think I do mark my pages patrolled. Doesn ' t Twinkle do it automatically ? __label__3 I don ' t see that it is necessarily bigoted to dislike certain forms of behaviour - after all, there is a group of people who practice racist behaviour. Is it bigoted to dislike them ? __label__3 Do you *just* want to extract columns 36 - 60? If so what does `O / CR` have to do with it ? __label__3 Is this homework? Which of these questions are you having problems with ? __label__3 $G'$ does not seem to add anything to your setup, as it is simply a forest of cliques. You seem to be asking about the average connectivity of $G$, but what is the distribution of functions ? __label__3 If it ' s a military box, how do you put the v - d - e in the corner? Or are those box types exempt ? __label__3 By revert all user contributions, do you mean ''all'' contributions? or just all contributions to one article ? __label__3 You ' re not developing on top of SQLite but deploying on top of PostgreSQL (i . e. Heroku), are you ? __label__3 @genneth I ' m not convinced.. I feel there can be some initial distribution of these particles resulting into some binary system or something revolving each other but not collapsing. Dare to prove this wrong ? __label__3 It seems to me that the font installation guide was set - up in a more elaborated way in previous versions. Am I missing something or confused with another document ? __label__3  " remove all 0 ' s and 1 ' s". So if your int is 2107900 you want to get 279 ? __label__3 I was starting bio..bio - something ' s talk page, telling him to make it an article, not a user page, and I saw that you wanted to delete it. Why ? __label__3 Did you install threads correctly (for. with CPAN shell)?__label__3 What exactly do you mean by tab - completion? Do you mean juts completing the commands available or completing the list of gems to install ? __label__3 You have 3 - 4 cups of juices left after a roast? How big was the roast?!__label__3 OK then. You take your time with what ever you do OK ? __label__3 Guess you ' re still living in the real world ;-) Just thought you might to have a gander at <person> and note the "other routes" sections..is <url> worth it? Were there any on the Omineca or Finlay btw ? __label__3 Thanks for the approval :) But as I said, my photoshop - fu is weak on this. Can you please post a tutorial ? __label__3 don ' t you only need the for loop to go up to half of the number you are tying to find the primality of? e . g if your number was 100, then 50 is the biggest number that could possibly be a factor of it, no ? __label__3 homework ?. Can you explain why you don ' t want to use genetic algo ' s or neural networks ?__label__3 <person>, with whom you discussed linkspam in 2006, has returned. Could you offer your views on his talkpage ? __label__3 I created this for you. However as a registered user, do you know you can create categories by yourself ? __label__3 Hahaha, maybe you should. What ' s happening ? __label__3 For a new project, I ' d recommend either using Spring MVC, or using JSF2 and not having to deal with pure JSP. JSP like that is heading towards legacyland.. Nothing *wrong* with using it, but why would you start a new project with it with better options available now ? __label__3 Is it possible that just that one board is not sealed, so rain water is soaking into the wood ? __label__3 Jtdirl: Seek primary source mentioning 1845 lightweight tiara made for Gregory XVI. Do you have it ? __label__3 is it NSLog(@"%@",self . data); i thought you said self . data was an array? maybe try fast enumeration ? __label__3 I think that if you use an example paragraph, and show the options in a nowiki tag, it will make it easier for people to "vote" for the method they like. Make sense ? __label__3 <url> is fooling around with the Rubinstein and Horowitz articles again. Is there a way to get him banned ? __label__3 Thanks Gilles for the answer.. But, i am not still able to get the whole concept. Could you please be a bit more simpler without reducing the information in it ? __label__3 <url>. Draft beer ? __label__3 I replied.. also, are you watching that page? If so, I will stop bothering you here ? __label__3 1. "There will be other references to it." So how do the owners of the other references know when it ' s safe to delete the objects ? __label__3 Why do you not want the cookies to be there? Does it matter as long as the content isn ' t being tracked ? __label__3 I objected because the image is replaceable. Why can ' t someone take a picture of it and release it freely ? __label__3 OK. In the future, can you kindly post a note on your userpage, talkpage, or somewhere else so I know that the bot isn ' t broken ? __label__3 How can I join, by the way? And is there a Welcoming Comittee userbox ? __label__3 If Doxiedana comes back to Wikipedia and asks me to restore her userpage, I will consider it. Are you claiming Doxiedana as your alternate account ? __label__3 I always thought that even if you need an account to view the info, it was allowed to be used on Wikipedia. Like the Magazine references ? __label__3 The founding date for <url> doesn ' t make sense. Which one should we use ? __label__3 One last thing, I noticed that Astro ' s gender is given as male. Is this erroneously placed ? __label__3 That ' s a *very* serious bug. Any chances you ' ve reported it in core . trac . wordpress . org ? __label__3 You might want to look at <url> then. Should I do to <url>, <url>, <url> (and others) like you did to Jake Ryan (eg, removing words like "a" and "the" in the beginning of sentences)?__label__3 Could you rephrase "This much days It work smoothly"? Do you mean the same stick worked some days ago ? __label__3 how do you know that Yuvan is confirmed for Striker? You indeed referring to the <url> starring Siddharth ? __label__3 Sorry, forgot to prefix your name. Also, is there some reason you are not using yum or similar to do the installation, since it does dependency handling ? __label__3 Yes, I do have the Family Guy DVD collection, Volume 1, Seasons 1 & 2. What ' s up ? __label__3 The question is how many ? or do you need to find them ?__label__3 Could you please clarify both 'integral' and 'interesting' a bit? They ' re subjective, which is why this is appropriately CW. The molecular cooking should make the dish a more intense version of the dish, not something gimmicky, is that your point ? __label__3 Re <url>, can you be more specific? Which IP address or range was blocked ? __label__3 In your picture, with the green wire, I see the magnetic field and the current, but where is the force pointing? And now what I am confused about is if you now coil this wire up in the picture I have attached, where are the force lines pointing ? __label__3 Silly question: does it maybe need more salt ? __label__3 @cHao Actually, i tried using select, but couldn ' t make it work. Can you give an example ? __label__3 Just so we ' re all clear here, what exactly does that function do? What is the input, what is the output ? __label__3 Wow, I see there are many newer versions, possibly even 3 . 10 but I can ' t find a decent download link, not even on the Canon web site.

Have you considered WiFi ? __label__3 I am not involved at all i any governmental or anti - drug organization or any pro- or anti - drug organization of any kind.

Is this state machine running for a long time in your main thread ? __label__3 @Jason Orendorff - Sorry, I meant just the response, the other was just a setup. I would have suggested that *her* in *I told her* is the IO (with the implicit news of her father ' s death being the DO) If *her* is a DO in that sentence, what about *I told her the news*?__label__3 @user1567: You add the function to the `wp _ ajax _ myaction` and `wp _ ajax _ admin _ myaction` hooks. Should that not be `wp _ ajax _ myaction` (for logged in users) and `wp _ ajax _ nopriv _ myaction` (for anonymous users)?__label__3 Dear @sb1, it ' s all great but could you please answer the main question - in non - engineering terms that often already suppose an answer without asking why - whether the energy just disappears in the form of electromagnetic waves and how much? How much do we have to try to "catch it" by surrounding the circuit ? __label__3 Not clear!

For example, "How many generations of stars will exist before the universe ' s nuclear fuel is depleted?"__label__3 Despite my answer, your question is too broad, if a question at all (no question mark). What I understand your question to be is how to use Google ? __label__3 OK, that one actually was a mistake, I will fix it.

What do you mean by "locking up"?__label__3 Your question is great, unfortunately it ' s very similar to a previous (very highly rated) [question](http://stats . stackexchange . com / questions / 3).

If it gives an error what ' s the error ? __label__3 As @Willie Wong says, marginpars are already floats and should not end up overlapping (although they may not end up where you want them to and long ones may overflow the bottom of the page, for which problem there is the marginfix package).

You are using LLVM for machine code compilation then ? __label__3 Now that I thought we had this figured out as clean and simple, but Google has expanded their street view to the south end of Smith - Dorrien Trail which shows a sign naming it Trail<url> rather than Spray Lakes Road.

Have you measured it ? __label__3 Your recent post to the straw poll at <url> may need some clarification. Did you intend "support going to Arbcomm" to be a vote for the "Death" entry ? __label__3 This is not really enough to tell what can be the problem. Have you tried debug you code, for example trace something in the conditions (so the function what have to be called is called properly or not)?__label__3 What OS? Can you establish a link local IP address ? __label__3 Did you notice his recommendation that you do the same? Let ' s both take a break, ok ? __label__3 Umm.. *what* means it is connected to GPRS?

Also, what software are you using for conversion and what dSLR is it ? __label__3 Maybe the bot needs to begin adding a source.

Or homework ? __label__3 No reason what so ever. But what storage backend should I use that fits the bill ? __label__3 Thanks for that.

Could you please provide an example ? __label__3 Yes. What about ''Q''&times;''Q'' with the L<sup>1</sup> norm ? __label__3 If it is always complete using numbers from 1..N you could just write the values 1..N to the input array. So I ' m guessing thats not going to cut it ? __label__3 Upon further thought, maybe I could look through lists of deleted articles to see if any interest me and see if I can bring them back (with adequate sourcing). Do you know anything about that process ? __label__3 Why do you use mysql (2 . 8 . 1) ? I think you can ' t use both for one application, do you have this 2 gems in your GemFile ?__label__3 I have these pedals, and don ' t have this problem. Perhaps it ' s your shoes ? __label__3 It just doesn ' t make sense (to me) that we use a manga spelling for one name but a Simmons' spelling for another.

Should that nor read "..which are not ''funded'' by the government.."?__label__3 Can you put here the links to do it? Please? :D__label__3 Your use of `n` is rather ubiquitous. Every student must like and dislike the same number `n` of people ? __label__3 What are typical values of N and K? Over / under one million ? __label__3 I was aware of that part of <url>, but I don ' t see its relevance here.

How ' s <url> doing ? __label__3 Hello Blix, and welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which version of Drupal are you interested ? __label__3 Why not? Wouldn ' t it make more sense to build your API and your charging model such that you _encourage_ innovation ? __label__3 That ' s not how Shoulda worked when I tried it out. Care to show us some code ? __label__3 Option 3 is my preferred option as well. but the recommendation suggested we go with option 2 first pending consensus on 3.

Of course they are..or in which circumstances they aren ' t ?__label__3 <url>. Are you planning to merge the info into <url> or just redirect to the article as is ? __label__3 `rssFeed` ?

Do you want to esclate it ? __label__3 Actually I just tested it with <url>, as it is using the <person>), although it is in the title; and it seemed to work fine. Are there any other titles that currently have them that I could try it with ? __label__3 What servletcontainer are you using / targeting? What ' s the reason that you don ' t use 3rd party libraries for this ? __label__3 The title says 8088 and the tags say 8086. Which one do you need ? __label__3 I ' m not familiar with Australian laws, but I ' d be surprised if there ' s anything there very different from similar laws elsewhere - answers would apply equally on other locales. Am I wrong about those laws ? __label__3 But that ' s just the same as `where user _ id = 6 and food _ id=2 and type=6` - ie matching all three criteria, so that no rows from your example will match. Are you sure that ' s what you meant ? __label__3 I want my name to get a fancy colour. Where do i go for this ? __label__3 No it doesn ' t really matter too much for your 50 odd sprites. But what ' s to lose ? __label__3 While the cat ' s away, the mice will play. Am I to assume your tongue is planted firmly in cheek in not writing "domus mea est domus tua"?__label__3 Could you try re - stating the question a little more clearly? I ' m not clear on how the comma - grouped lists of connections in your "path" relates to the input graph G.

Do you mean something like a photographer ' s credit ? __label__3 Soo.. I should merge and rewrite, right ? __label__3 Your kB / s is extremely low, personally I do not see that, I get full speed transfers (400kB / s = my broadband limit). Can you check other downloads or streaming and provide information about your connection configuration ? __label__3 Why are capital letters used in the article title ''<url>''? Is this a proper name of a particular proprietary software package ? __label__3 Are you sure you actually need to implement your own iterators? Isn ' t `typedef typename std::vector<T>::iterator iterator;` good enough ? __label__3 +1: "We try to not put the sales men in the same room." Can I work for you please ? __label__3 In <url>, you said that "the template which appears only on his music sub pages". Do you regard <url> as a sub page ? __label__3 Do you mean that the envelope allows free ion passage? Or do you mean that the envelope, as a result of its pores, allows ion passage ? __label__3 I agree it is a bit hectic how active the conversation is. Would you like to take it to #wikipedia ?__label__3 I ' m having trouble understanding this "all the unread and not deleted private messages", because `is _ read` and `is _ deleted` fields seem to be in Recipient model instead of PrivateMessage. What makes private message deleted ? __label__3 Just out of interest, is it now considered acceptable to utilize "utilize" instead of using "use" as in the question above? Or should I stop worrying about this ? __label__3 How do you sort two dimensional data with quicksort? And how does this help finding the two closest points ? __label__3 Sorry, I ' m a newbie in Physics world. But since you said that it ' s always with other stuff, can ' t we just weight the whole bundle of ' em (quark with other stuff), then if we know the weight of other stuff, do simple math ? __label__3 I feel that this is essentially a duplicate of http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 360542 / plumber - programmers - vs - computer - scientists. Anyone feel differently ? __label__3 ARSBot seems to not be working? Can it be turned back on ? __label__3 I still prefer Huxley ' s version, as I don ' t think that version makes the dying off clear, and ignores the r - type organism analogue. Is there any way to work more emphasis into the dying off part in, as it ' s absolutely crucial to the removal of unfit forms ? __label__3 Yes, I ' d say split it. But, where ' s the controversial opinion ? __label__3 Glad it ' s fixed. What ' s a sensai mechanic ? __label__3 Vaguely connected, because I don ' t feel like starting a new section. Have you seen <url>?__label__3 why is the profile a different model from the user? wouldn ' t all the profile attributes be for the user ? __label__3 Hi, as the creator of this article, this made me nervous until I saw it was reverted. Can you tell me what was that all about ?__label__3 Can you detail what you ' re trying to distinguish between?

Know anyone to do a proper translation ? __label__3 is PTString a property / field? And what does the console say ? __label__3 could we get some column names, and what do the id ' s reference? there is no ID you have given us on any other column.. and what do you mean by "somehow combine them"?__label__3 Why do you need to compress it that way ? Do you need fast information retrieval once the data is compressed, it is a question of memory ?__label__3 In this question ' s current state, I feel it would fall under 'how do I make game X'. And if you ' ve made more complex games, couldn ' t you simply pick up an up - to - date API reference and write a framework? ;-)__label__3 I ' m changing over to your Rangers idea. Any way we could get a fairly obvious link to 2006 - 07 season page on the main <url> article ? __label__3 I have absolutely no desire to breach copyright, could you please clarify the status of images on Flickr? Do I have to get direct permission from the author or do I only obtain free images from Creative Commons ? __label__3 I find it hard to figure what "rule" you have in mind to generate the sequence.

Ur unset them ? __label__3 <person> is dropping OR on various talk pages, including his own and his userpage - and linking his talk page to his blog. <url> or rather blogs <url> - not run into this sort of linking before, is there any guidance about it somewhere ? __label__3 The message I get is `"No command 'dmd' found."` What exactly is dmd ? __label__3 Also, what happens when you compare 15 Jan to 10 March? 3? 2 . xx ? __label__3 Can you add some more code?

Whats you think ? __label__3 I don ' t understand: what is P1, P2 .. ? Isn ' t just one process ? __label__3 int . MaxValue does not count as a 'huge number' in the field of primality testing. How big are your numbers ? __label__3 do you ever build without debug, e . g. a release config ? __label__3 All those people have said to news sources they aren ' t running / are / or something related? Or am I confused ? __label__3 Given the comments <url> (saying that Ganglia also should be added to the bypass list), and the fact that there are about 10 WMF projects, wouldn ' t it be more effective if there was only a "whitelist" for adding the WMF projects (which all have a secure version), such as Wikipedia, Wikiversity, Wikinews, Wiktionary, etc? Or would there be some drawbacks in doing this ? __label__3 What version of Oracle?

Why could you not get it to work ? __label__3 I would like to create a few plots. Where can I access the geologic temperature record raw data ? __label__3 Why a `BigDecimal`?

How serious is the problem ? __label__3 To be quite frank it doesn ' t matter that the quotes don ' t appear any other place on the internet, the point is that they violate policy by being here and you could always set up a personal website to host them where all you ' d have to worry about is fair use and not Wikipedia ' s stricter requirements.

Do you get equal files ? __label__3 If you ' re not using your user page, you should try redirecting it to your talk.

A View, a custom made page, a node, ..?__label__3 In fact, I think I remember saying something to that effect during the ArbCom election campaign.

When you say, "which might differ just slightly" are you referring to the colors or the random numbers ? __label__3 They come with cheese, come in beef, chicken, and pork and are full of fiber.

Any chance that the information originally had anything to do with the John Lamb mentioned in <url>?__label__3 I see on your user page you are claiming credit for creating ''The Cops'' article however wasn ' t it initally created by another user <url> on 26 January 2007 ??__label__3 Are you talking about the deployed executable? Isn ' t everything compiled into the executable ? __label__3 What ' s your input source? Apache httpd logs ? __label__3 It is my understanding that I can clean up my own talk page.

Who is Alan climate gore ? __label__3 What have you tried yourself? Is it a homework / interview - question ? __label__3 I believe it was I who moved it, based on what appeared to be consensus to use the hyphen in that context.

Does that make sense ? __label__3 What is offensive in that question? And why is it downvoted ? __label__3 You ' ve seen the RR crossing sign, such as Image : Highway - Rail _ Grade _ Crossing _ Advance _ Warning _ sign . svg.

Maybe there ' s nothing on that site yet ? __label__3 I know that this has been discussed before by various editors, but can anybody give me a reason why the problem is normally formulated in terms of the door numbers (1 , 2 , 3) and not the objects behind the doors (the car, goat 1, and goat 2). Is this just because the door are given numbers in the problem statement but the goats are not given names ? __label__3 I don ' t quite understand the problem.

Any reason for this ? __label__3 This is a toughy. Do you think it could be integrated with <url>?__label__3 PS, we are having a discussion about such a new criterion at this moment - see <url>. Rather than ignoring the policy because you think it broken, why don ' t you join in with the discussion to make it not broken ? __label__3 That ' s correct - but we weren ' t strict about it. Why ? __label__3 What does "efficient" mean here? What size data set are you most commonly expecting to work with ? __label__3 Is this a homework? Have you tried to find out how to calculate Good Friday in general, independent of any programming language ? __label__3 When i upload <url> I get <url> can you fix it? Also why is <url> showing the old logo ? __label__3 So you haven ' t found a flaw in any of their ideas themselves? As regards your other comment, are you saying that all Muslims are equally capable of finding out the truth about Islam ? __label__3 can you give details of what exactly these tar files are supposed to contain? what is the script supposed to do with the output of pdflatex ? __label__3 Does the empty tile have to obey the normal rules?

Even if we were using a non - throwing version of `new`, what ' s the likelihood of `new` failing to allocate the insignificant amount of memory in that program ? __label__3 Answer is very subjective. Is the bacon going to be used in a recipe, or just to be eaten or breakfast ? __label__3 So ''Junanci'' means "Greeks"? In which language ? __label__3 What about (1 , 5) and (3 , 5)?

Could you shift an inline, or add more extraordinary bits ? __label__3 We have <url>. Fourth times a charm ? __label__3 Strongly depends on what you do. What do you do ? __label__3 But what are the rules? Are the players split in some groups (and playing with each other within)?__label__3 Huh..

Do you understand why the answer is 6 ? __label__3 I ' m wondering why extractObject()'s return type is `const bool` and why it says `const int&` as one of it ' s parameter. What is the advantage ? __label__3 It ' s alive! Care to critique the reborn <url> article <G>?__label__3 Hey, I just tried to link to Marat Ayin and it came up as a red link. Do you know if we have an article on it and I ' m just not using the right transliteration or do we really not have an article ? __label__3 I don ' t understand what you mean by 'all pairs'. Say you have three coordinates (x, y, and z) such that x dominates y and y dominates z.

Also, what type of door opener is it (chain, belt or screw)?__label__3 @Ray Toal: The regular expressions can contain + or * but a maximum string length would ensure there are not infinite possibilities. Am I making sense ? __label__3 The template I want is the one that goes at the bottom of the article and produces a message that goes something like 'This article is a copy of the (X) article in the German wikipedia, version 21 December 2009 10 : 04.' What is that template ? __label__3 On a HTML document? Are you referring to a screenshot ? __label__3 So how do you get it working again? iisreset ? __label__3 You only need one "=" on the third line.

So when can I change it back without getting blocked ? __label__3 Geeky and Cool do not coexist? :P What ' s Google then ? __label__3 It looks like you are planning to build a bike as opposed to buying a complete bike. Is that correct ? __label__3 @Markos Fragkakis Can you show your Seam component and your page ? ear or war ?__label__3 @btilly. Sounds pretty brute - force :) If that ' s your proposal, why not writing it in an answer instead of a comment ? __label__3 thank you, that ' s it. can you please help me how to save it like 1bit png ? __label__3 Please further specify .odt, and .org files. For which application ( s)?__label__3 do you have a definition for complexity? Do you know Big O Notation ? __label__3 Who deleted it?

Shouldn ' t it also be a primary topic or are there actual rules which discourage practice of "all caps"?__label__3 How long does your regression test take to complete? Surely it should be based on this ? __label__3 Just googled "scarping" in case it was a term I was unfamiliar with. I take it that you must mean "scraping"?__label__3 So, how was my edit <url>?

How large are you data (is brute force an option)?__label__3 Ah, I was confused by the fact that your tag was placed on <url>, not on <url>. Wildbot has visited, & updated the talk page again, so where is the result of the whole exercise ? __label__3 Thank you, that ' s exactly what I needed. I ' m not completely sure of what you mean when you talk about the overdispersion (sorry, I ' m not a statistician, maybe it ' s something very basic).. You say that the residual deviance should be equal to the residual degrees of freedom.. how would I check that ? __label__3 My concern would be that the doWork procedure will finish (going on to workComplete) while your timer is still running calling the OnTimerEvent. Are you sure you just don ' t want a loop with thread . Sleep in the do work method ? __label__3 Also, it strikes me that the <url> need a map. How did you go about getting your Chew Valley map done ? __label__3 Either you don ' t understand what AJAX does / how it works or you haven ' t posted all the relevant code.

But, you at least agree with my edit removing the redundancies, no ? __label__3 Problem isn ' t too hard; I ' m taking care of it. Had you discovered <person>?__label__3 What have you tried? What is going wrong with it ? __label__3 Anyone? Any ideas ? __label__3 `DateTime` is not a built - in class in Java SE. Where does this type come from ? __label__3 Do you have a link for that? I assume you mean you ' re out <url>?__label__3 I find this answer confusing. If it is a hollandaise, how can it be made without yolk? Where do the emulsifiers come from? Could you maybe explain a bit more how it is made ? __label__3 can you post the xaml? where you are binding at ? __label__3 Sorry, I thought you were looking for a connected subgraph, which will necessarily be a tree, appearing in a given set of trees. Could you clarify in what aspects your problem differs from this description ? __label__3 Can you clarify what you ' re trying to do?

Is it just here for show, or do you want it to be considered ? __label__3 You need to look SciPy for Ironpython - See http://pytools . codeplex . com/ for more information.

I understand why you added the ref, but it wouldn ' t hurt to just wait until it has been peer - reviewed, would it ? __label__3 Those are not runtime errors, they ' re from the linker! As Richard Pennington suggests, there ' s probably a problem with the way you ' re building it under Unix -- perhaps linking against the same library twice ? __label__3 no.. depending on the flag count, i wanted to print the values of flag.. the first case should print aa and the next case should print aa , bb , cc. is it possible to do that in a single line of code ? __label__3 What about simply running Clang (or, if you want to punish the user with bad error messages, CC) from a Ruby script? What have you tried ? __label__3 Are there also $2 bills? If not, where do the 2 ' s come from ? __label__3 Why are you storing the `first`/`second` iterators in another circular buffer? There could be arbitrarily many of those, why not put those into a linear container, preferably a container of pairs ? __label__3 if there is no private information kept, then why is there a user number attached to the link? why not just a link to the survey ? __label__3 You ' re using `::` for type annotations and `\x -> ..` for lambdas, the combination of which is, to my knowledge, unique to Haskell and things closely related to it. Given that, why not just type `:t \f x -> \g -> g (f x g)` into GHCi and see what it tells you ? __label__3 Hi, I was looking through <url> and noticed that the Gaza article has been on hold for over five weeks. There doesn ' t seem to have been much discussion on the talk page in April, so what ' s the status of the article ? __label__3 That ' s nice. May I ask why you noticed this ? __label__3 Thanks; I was confused by the situation (indeed, I still am), so I had no idea what to do.

Is LALR ( 1) not sufficient for you, and if so, in what ways ? __label__3 Why do you need to do it without looping? It seems that looping does what you want in this case ? __label__3 I don ' t understand your question. Can you clarify ? __label__3 Show some code. And are you sure that the file actually contains linebreaks and it ' s not your terminal or whatever you use to view it ? __label__3 I ran across this again this month. It <url> since we last saw it; do you still subscribe to your judgment <url>?__label__3 @mattdm: the most interesting that the writer says that he broke his kit down to items that didn ' t do the job as well, but were more inconspicuous. So, uh, I wonder if Minox is still in business ? __label__3 Do the scales overlap to some extent (i . e. shared constructs across the questionnaires)?__label__3 These are individual strings? Not one huge block, correct ? __label__3 You created this template, but it is only used in one article. Do you intend to expand its use, or is it not required ? __label__3 You should provide more information. If your site has an URL like http://example . com, how can a URL like https://twitter . com/#!/AlaaBatayneh / status / 72020345695109122 be set as path for your node ? __label__3 First use strict and warnings. Next: Any error you can see?, Also, you open $file for read or write ? __label__3 I ' m really bad at problems like that, but if the int - stream is randomized data and you know the min and max (MAX _ INT?) creating a simple tree is automatically balanced if the root is MAX _ INT / 2 ? __label__3 What happens if you try access the magic method of __tostring? .. `echo $matches->item ( 0)` ?__label__3 While you are absolutely free to vote however you choose, FAC requires you lodge actionable objections and your objection as it stands right now is quite vague. Could you please specify it so I can take action and possibly reverse your vote ? __label__3 All allegations currently in the article should have sources. Can you indicate which ones do not ? __label__3 Homework?

What is single specific format ? __label__3 Hi GW.. I was a bit bored today, so I made this: <url>.. What do you think so far ? __label__3 Your image link is broken. Can you try to find new image and link to that ? __label__3 I think we ' re going to just have to agree to disagree on whether it is a sub genre or fusion then! Can we at least agree to leave the three genres on Dookie as they are ? __label__3 Cool. ''(sound of ruffling wiki - pages back and forth)'' "Looking forward" on which talk page ? __label__3 Do you want the scans to be run continuously or on - demand. Also, do you want devs to be able to configure their own scans, or just trigger / request one ? __label__3 Personally I think (much) longer gallery captions are probably the answer; these are probably easier than working each image into the text. Didn ' t that work at s**-p**?__label__3 @GeeGoldz, will you be accepting an answer? @csl, how about that bounty ? __label__3 why can ' t you use corporate authorship? if Deutsche Bank can claim ownership of those emails can ' t Charter 97 claim ownership of the picture ? __label__3 Advantages in comparison with what? Unbalanced trees, AVL trees, hash tables, ..?__label__3 You just made <url> to <url>, which I reverted.

How to transfer the data between pocket outlook and your application ? __label__3 I was unaware of <url> when prodding the article. However, bearing the <person> tag on <url>, is this list really usefull ? __label__3 It should work. Why do you say it doesn ' t ? __label__3 Are you there? I just posted YAP, Yet Another Plea, on <url>, might you wish to pitch in with something technical or at least magisterial ? __label__3 Moonriddengirl, is there a specific reason to why they want to use the crop? Is it because there ' s attribution on it ? __label__3 I think you ' re trying to find repeating characters at the beginning of a string, is this correct? Would you mind rephrasing your question ? __label__3 Question: how do we move the content from the existing page to the new page? How do we reference the space to the new page ? __label__3 And, in case I forget, it is what happens when I sign with four tildes.

How about this http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Denial _ of _ the _ Armenian _ Genocide ?__label__3 While I don ' t want to discourage non - technical questions, I can ' t see how this one can possibly be answered, other than "it depends", or possibly "when the artist is dead". Maybe it could be rephrased as "What are approaches for defining the scope of a photographic project?"__label__3 Deletion requires some care: an administrator has to check that the prod tag has been on the article for 5 day continously, that the prod ' ed version was not the result of vandalism, that the prod reason is acceptable (possibly checking the talk page), then has to delete the article reporting this reason, possibly deleting the talk page, and finally checking the incoming links. Before starting doing this on every article in the category this adimin relies on the number of categories instead of calculating five days to today ? __label__3 I have just tested this in a Google Presentation Document by copying the symbol in your question. It displays fine in design and when I click Start Presentation ?__label__3 Do you mean that you have a web browser showing Facebook and separate desktop application written in Java?

That is, `00112` is identical to `11002` and `22001` because they all share the form: `aabbc`?__label__3 I don ' t really see a good question here. Can you focus it a bit ? __label__3 How do you save it??__label__3 There are SO many plugins that will do this for you, with fancy transitions between images.

Why do you want / need to change it ? __label__3 Ah, I didn ' t have the XNA framework on that machine (because of the lack of VS I ' m guessing). Can you check for that on load ? __label__3 What do you mean by "take off" in relation to brightness here ? Do you mean "reduce", or perhaps "measure" ?__label__3 Were you ill for that seminar? Maybe ask your lecturer / prof ? __label__3 I am not sure why <url> is not just in the article <url> as a straight table. Is there some chance the template might be used on another article ? __label__3 You ' re back! And, am I ready for what ? __label__3 Put a breakpoint at the `pointsToCalculate [ i].originalLocation = i;` line.

Can you get it for me ? __label__3 Hi Josiah- I ' m a touch concerned about the entry on Ian Levine ' s bio about his comparison to the Abzorbaloff thing.

I ' ve never seen the movie, but are you sure it wasn ' t some other carousel - type thing ? __label__3 +1, but no Windows servers? And this is just backing up data, no DRP / BCP, right ? __label__3 The data is dynamic for each particular user? Or is it dynamic for a particular period of time, but for all users during that time span ? __label__3 I just want this to end and be proven innocent. After can we friends ? __label__3 Can you show us your code? How are you calling COlorbox ? __label__3 Alright, RFC time. Can we meet on IRC ? __label__3 Birth place of Arnie.

Or what do you think about Lieven ' s answer ?__label__3 You say you declare `class myApps`, you go and declare `class myClass`, and in the other file you declare `class MyClass`. Is this the exact code that causes you the problem ? __label__3 That ' s very odd, since the pedal is just 2 months old.

What specifically are you looking for examples of ? __label__3 Seeing this problem with a bit of perspective, an idea would be to embed bibliographic metadata in PDF files. Maybe biblatex can do that or can be made to ? __label__3 @Itai, your dislike of vignetting is hardly a reason to judge something as too subjective and therefore to close it. Is this site for technicians or photographers ? __label__3 Of course it does, and the damage is irreparable too, close to that from a large scale nukular explosion.

Could you try and reword your question ? __label__3 I don ' t have a 5770 but I do have a 5870. Is it of any value for me to test that out for you ? __label__3 Is assuming op ( b , a) > op ( c , a) for all b > c also allowed? (Is op ( a , b) = op ( b , a) like for add & mul?)__label__3 It ' s a sand box, a guide for future topics. It is a copyright even if not in the main namespace ? __label__3 What range of characters?

Please tell me exactly what I can do to prove my ownership ? __label__3 They look like relatively normal new editor with lots of background and opinions on the Cherokee, but not much Wikipedia knowledge (yet), though it looks likely that they might be Bill John Baker. Is that what you ' re afraid of ? __label__3 Can you run it? Do you have a MIPS board or an emulator or something ? __label__3 I don ' t know of any such filter, but it shouldn ' t be all that hard to write.

My sketch of a certain bird, if I was a good enough sketcher ? __label__3 Some of his categories seem rather POV to me, and it ' s rather obvious from his AfD participation that there ' s a disruptive streak afoot.

What sort of county was it, then ? __label__3 This is what you stated from the page <url>. Can you link to me the policy stating that minimum amount of content in an article, where it ' s not 'lacking in content,' is needed to be considered undue ? __label__3 Thank you for fixing your edit. But why did you make it in the first place ? __label__3 Sorry, I ' m actually talking about the μF, not the voltage. What do you think about that ? __label__3 I added mention of the river. The info for <url> says the picture was taken in <url>; is that city located on the river ? __label__3 I did a CC sharealike 2 . 0.

(R, SAS, SPSS, etx ?)__label__3 Could you provide some more details? How fast (day, week)? Are there other ingredients beside water, flour, starter, & salt ? __label__3 Thanks for your answer, but i ' m still not sure i understand.

Have you considered updating it ? __label__3 What you linked to looks good, but what was I supposed to compare it with again? Got a link ? __label__3 This is an [entity](http://ww . tizag . com / xmlTutorial / xmlentity . php). What do you intend when you talk about an entity ? __label__3 ok so, 100 arrays. If multiple users are loading a page with 100 arrays would that have any major performance problems ? __label__3 I ' ll be touch and go for a few days, but hopefully I will have a stable connection again. In the mean time, I think there are a few things I need to get caught up on, yes ? __label__3 This deleted page was recreated. Since you were the original nom., is this basically the same article, or has it been improved ? __label__3 In last few decencies many new theories occured about it, some prominent historians are involved from all ex - Yugoslav republics, with the same general idea - Slavic speakers were present in the Balkans much earlier, some claims say even from 1st century AD. What is said by "your" sources about it ? __label__3 Well, yes, obviously (but I sort of assumed that the same exemptions would apply to 1RR as 3RR - is that not the case?) Should I self - rv ? __label__3 @kaiser: Sorry, not meaning to be harsh. I just don ' t understand for what real world reason you would advocate just sticking to those terms ? __label__3 actually, I found the requirement that "your proof should work with any F, not just MST or MSF" a little impossible because the weight could be any in the forest. any hint ? __label__3 Sorry but I ' m more or less a total kid in Linux - land. Any way you could provide more detailed instructions or point me to a tutorial or link? TIA ! __label__3 Incidentally, Jossi has admitted to having negative opinions about Golb and to "throwing oil on the fire" in that regard on another talk page. Is it entirely appropriate for him to be involved in editing this page ? __label__3 Also, someone suggested merging it with another hoax page. Why wasn ' t that option considered ? __label__3 Why do you want to disable it? Because of memory leak or unpredictable bugs ? __label__3 <url>. I don ' t know the guy, doesn ' t look very notable, but I feel this strange kinship..old..undervalued..metal..can you save him ? __label__3 I don ' t understand how you ' re getting 2 3 4 6 from that array. There are five elements from the array, shouldn ' t it be 3 3 2 4 6 ? __label__3 @Noctrine I sincerely appreciate that. :) @Frederick Imbeault Can you share a link to the article you read ? __label__3 I agree this is subjective, but on the other hand I think this is a good topic to talk about. Perhaps if we elaborate a bit on the "why" part in the answers, it might be generally useful enough ? __label__3 Target platform is OS X. @Bavarious What alternatives ? __label__3 if i send email to permissions - en@wikimedia . org is the email made public? where is it made public ? __label__3 I don ' t know, the only thing I can think of is that I changed his name to "Psycho Derek" for Wikipedia : CommonName purposes. Or he ' s in guest stars ? __label__3 Sorry, can you explain your problem a bit better? Do you want to upload a wordfile to your media library and the footnotes of the .doc file were stripped out or do you want to upload a .doc file, extract the content and make a wordpress post out of it ? __label__3 That sounds to POVish to me <url>. What do you think ? __label__3 Talking about this subject, I noticed that you supported showing a link between Dacian and the Baltic languages - but questioned whether this meant they were part of the Balto - Slavic group. Surely, they would be part of the group by definition, since are not all the Baltic languages descended from proto Balto - Slavic ? __label__3 If you were falsely accused of vandalism, the best thing to do is to talk to the user who accused you, and explain why your edit was not vandalism. Which user accused you vandalism ? __label__3 There are many general purpose languages.

I see badges well wrapped on badge _ counts key, why do you think they need to ble flattened ? __label__3 Well, the Synopsis section of the module shows you what to do.

How often do you commute via bike ? __label__3 Any update? Have you found out why they ' re requesting these details ? __label__3 Hey, so your move of this, and wanted to point out that the reason I put a disambig title on it, was because there are two different labor unions of the same name, either one of which could wind up with an article. But, I don ' t know that that means the article should automatically get the title, is there a standard for this situation ? __label__3 @code: **Come on!** I have *already* made an end - user friendly site at http://stacklist . quickmediasolutions . com - can we stick to what we already have ? __label__3 I ' ve also put a <nowiki><person></nowiki> tag on your user page.. I ' m not entirely sure if that ' s what you were after ? __label__3 Does that mean I am allowed to create my own version of the algorithms? or should I need to follow a pseudo code from a standard governing body like NSIT ? __label__3 Homework? Project Euler ? __label__3 It looks like you ' re not null terminating your `argv` array. Or is that just left out of your example ? __label__3 Like most users with their articles screwed over by <url>'s new web facelift, I ' m at a lost with <url> being dead. Can you help ? __label__3 @Evan: ? Is this a car thing ? __label__3 Fair enough, although the point that the Department serves a sizable population - since some cities may only have inhabitants in the hundreds - should be noted somewhere in the article. Perhaps when someone expands it, sometime in the future ? __label__3 You use the abbreviation WPMOS on your request on the Graphic Map Lab <url>. What does it mean ? __label__3 ohh man it ' s messed up now. How do I add code to the comments??__label__3 You ' ll have to be much more specific. How are you escaping the text before entering it into the database ? __label__3 `header("Content - type: image / jpeg");` does not set a header, instead it sends raw header to the browser. What do you want to achieve ? __label__3 Don ' t use the `javascript:` pseudo - protocol in inline event handler attributes; you ' re merely adding a useless JavaScript label there. Moreover, this should work as expected, what exactly does not work ? __label__3 Perhaps an essay could clarify this? "Be Assertive, not Aggressive", or "Act like a Professional"?__label__3 "..in Mauritanian Ouguiya, it ' s اوقية‎0 . 00!" - Wait, Mauritania has an app store? :)__label__3 yes, just put all these lines inside your function and replace the actual values with the argument names. what ' s the problem ?__label__3 Well, I think this is a murder that could do with wide categorisation (as an example of asian - on - white killings, rather than the far more famous white - on - black, not to mention that British does nto automatically=English. If it ' s merely a matter of preference, do you mind if I put the British one back ? __label__3 you need to clarify what variables the `summation` applies to in your equation? is it summing over all `i` and `j` for each slice (color in the third dimension) or do you want the sum over all values ? __label__3 Xandar, this Elizabeth II RFC represents the form of RFC I would like to use for the Catholic Church article. What do you think ? __label__3 I assume you have artwork that is actually of a higher resolution? Or would you just be scaling up the lower - resolution ones ? __label__3 In what way is it failing? Exception ? __label__3 Which shell? How have you tried to do this so far ? __label__3 What method *serialized* a `Boolean` to "true" and "false"? Or are you simply talking about producing a `String` from a `Boolean`?__label__3 I dunno, but this one reeks of that banned user <url> - same mark - as - minor edits, same targets. Care for a look at this ? __label__3 For the household income page, can you find a way to eliminate the <url> page and instead change it back to its original title, "List of countries by household income"? Who changed that ? __label__3 Halfling may be another name for Hobbit, but the model for the Hobbit encouraged the creation of other Halflings. Nevertheless it is a Halfling, is it not ? __label__3 On that topic, not every DOS game on Wikipedia has a screenshot. Do you plan on taking any yourself ? __label__3 What does "OP" mean? Does it mean "operator"?__label__3 This is one of those rare situations where I really have no idea what to say. Thanks ? __label__3 That is the standard ARBMAC (Arbitration related to some Macedonian and other Balkan countries) warning. Still interested in accepting the deal ? __label__3 The history section appears to be copied and pasted directly from somewhere. Is this a copyvio issue ? __label__3 <url>. I wonder if anyone will actually suspect a conflict of interest ? __label__3 This depends immensely on size of the organization, complexity and number of systems, usage patterns, level of required / actual security, etc. Can you add some more details ? __label__3 @Jennifer S Sorry, one more question: do you chop them before to saute' them in a skillet ? Can I use olive oil as well ?__label__3 Latest version (now on Commons); all placenames included but still needs some tidying up and tweaking. Comments ? __label__3 I ' ve been running into your super stub articles while organizing a category. Are these all FOIA requests ? __label__3 I ' ve heard Greeks pronounce the name of the letter ''I'' as ''yota''. What do you intend "giota" to sound like ? __label__3 I know ''shin'' is one letter in the Hebrew alphabet, but the "sh" in English is a diphtong and there should be no need to transliterate the shin to SH. Have you seen this convention in any other articles ? __label__3 Not a whole lot of contrast with the letters now, if you ' ve traversed the link. Maybe a green pattern is just not the right base color, if we are trying to avoid confusing with WP officialstuff ? __label__3 Could you please take a look at the pictures I added to my question? Am I on the right track ? __label__3 Paws__List is intended to be a _copy_ of List? not a reference or some sort of alias ? __label__3 The <url> has several pictures uploaded by you with no source or license information.

Have you read <url>?__label__3 @Darin Dimitrov Can you please tell me for how long you have been using 4 . 0? just after it got released ? __label__3 Well perhaps I am "out of touch". Can you please point me to where a new consensus has formed on this issue ? __label__3 It ' s not clear what you ' re trying to do. Are you getting the input as a string using `raw _ input()` or something similar ? __label__3 I ' m not quite sure who you are, and I don ' t know why you dislike me, but the feeling is not reciprocated (or maybe it is, and I ' ve forgotten?). Where do I know you ? __label__3 Hi J. I ' m thinking it might be a bad idea to start linking all unnamed EP recordings to the EP dab page. Could turn into a very massive list, and maybe not the right use for a dab page ? __label__3 You should probably clarify what kind of framework you ' re talking about? 3D Graphics Framework ? __label__3 @Saurabh I don ' t think it is very clear. How is your group _ name related to the child content ? __label__3 I assume this is homework, yes? What have you tried so far ? __label__3 Delimiters corresponding to what?

No database ? __label__3 I would like to do the same for <url>, a Houston neighborhood. How do I do this ? __label__3 Sounds fishy to me. What are they going to give you for that $75 ? __label__3 Are you trying to write a standalone program to invert matrices or write a `transpose` function as part of a bigger program? If it ' s a standalone program, how is your program supposed to get its input and output ? __label__3 Are you talking about that I noticed that <url> wasn ' t in <url> even though <person> was changed to use <person> on 6 October 2010? And then did some script - assisted editing to remove <url> from a bunch of pages that had both the category and <person>?__label__3 I ' ve had a look at it..I cannot make the height / width of the image any smaller because it will limit the number of towns I can add. Therefore, is there any point to adding an atlas to wikipedia ? __label__3 Is this homework? If so, could you please tag it as such ? __label__3 They usually gather in the meeting hall. What do you want them to do ? __label__3 Just in case you didn ' t know - <url> has been blocked for being a <url> of <url> (also blocked). Shouldn ' t their nonsense be cleaned up ? __label__3 Interview question, then? If not, can you explain what this will be used for - I can ' t think of an application for this right now ? __label__3 There ' s a lot of **not* Mac OS X specific** answers, which is a requirement outlined in the question. Should the answers be revisited or the question edited ? __label__3 Is the function given the ready - made number (`1491625..`) or does it have to compute it itself? Extracting the nth digit should be easy (regardless of the base - but I assume you talk about base 10?).__label__3 Sorry?? Which comment are you referring to ? __label__3 What do you mean? How a compiler would implement them, or how to use them ? __label__3 as I said, here you can ask for *security* books. Btw, do you really mean "wireless", or did you actually mean more specifically "wifi"?__label__3 I ' m not sure what needs doing now, or if there are further modifications required (this is the first article I ' ve ever nominated for GA). Is there anything you can point me in the direction of ? __label__3 hi Talvi, this question is a bit too general, discussiony and "no correct answer" for what we like to see here. Can you be MUCH more specific with what you want ? __label__3 I don ' t see a connection between the <url> and the <url> articles that would warrant See Also links between the two. Could you explain that to me ? __label__3 @Nate - Yeah, this is pretty close to that question. I ' m not up on disc brakes; anyone know if these can be merged, or is there enough difference between the two models to maintain the two Q & A threads separately ? __label__3 Did you try it? Did you encounter any errors ? __label__3 Surely to embed HTML5 into another site that site has to be written in or support HTML5. Or am I missing something ? __label__3  ' filtering' means 'message arrived - aplly it a label / archive / delete / forward. So what ? __label__3 Now we can see FileList, it ' s simple.

Basically, the compression will be removal of extra spaces and line breaks, which can decrease the file size substantially, but how will you re - construct it again on the client side ? __label__3 I think some of those "citation needed" cases are on the Oldest Britain ' s website. Are those considered "validated"?__label__3 Staeckerbot has notified me five times so far about the same images - see <url> page history.

How do you find out which X is associated to which Y ? __label__3 Ta, can tell its cold here - I thought I was putting the message on your talk page and then realised it was indons, and the similar spurious etymology and anecdotal rubbish is at ratu bokos palace as well - had found a brilliant article on ratu boko in BKI but mislaid it anmd havent gone back. There is a means by where well documented folklore can stay on an article page if the editor knows of the correct texts to qoute re folklore and spurious etymology or geneology in java - but if there is no acknowledgement of the academic / citable ways of exlaining I say that such addons are ad hoc and worth the chop and message to user 'this is an encyc' - watcha think ? __label__3 @Helder This Q is a total mess -- can you please smooth it a little (like rewrite)?

What is your response to my suggestion <url>?__label__3 I couldn ' t understand what you were really asking until I read the answers; I take it that `midiIn . listPorts()` is not the part that actually "re - checks the ports", despite the name.

What did you not understand about the examples presented there ? __label__3 What exactly do you mean by continue with left+right? Say the original text was "abcdefgh", and your two 'words' are "cd" and "bef", would you first split into "ab"-"cd"-"efgh", and then search in "abefgh", and find "bef", and split into "a"-"bef"-"gh" and then continue with "agh", and not find anything ? __label__3 This is a very confusing question! How are you compiling your C programs ? __label__3 finding GCD recursively is the fastest known method.

What language is this ? __label__3 Did you add `C:\Ruby19 \ bin;` to path? What say `path` and `ruby -v` commands ? __label__3 None of this is going to answer your question, but: 1) you probably want to swap 1st and 4th lines 2) What is the purpose of tmp _ 64 _ data? 3) should the second "if" be "else if"?__label__3 The question seems to be ill - defined. Do you mean that you want to find min {abs ( t [ i]-t [ j]): i=/=j}?__label__3 What platform? VisualC(++)/gcc / ANSI C ? __label__3 I ' m puzzled by this <url>.

Kakve ja veze imam sa tim Faust Vranu010diu0107em ? __label__3 It is the choice of template name as "Shinto2" which seems IMHO poor for use within an article (i . e. the "2" bit), hence suggestion of <nowiki><url></nowiki> (distinct from <nowiki><url></nowiki> currently used for various talk page headers), or if you don ' t like that as a name then perhaps <nowiki><url></nowiki> (invoked as <person>) ?__label__3 Hmm..

Your views ? __label__3  # On the other hand, linking years of actual encyclopedic events to "1949 in NASCAR" or "1950 in motor racing" <s>gives us a tool for eventually building those year - in - topic articles</s> automatically builds those categories.

What do you think ? __label__3 @spinning _ plate "this will work". What do you mean by "this"?__label__3 It ' s not really clear what you ' re asking.

Am I wrong ? __label__3 I gave user <url> an official 3RR. Is there anything that can be done about this ?__label__3 Yes, you get all kinds of people coming to visit. Which seat are you in ? __label__3 @whuber Sorry, I can ' t see why that AmStat article is relevant. Where is the time-*dependent* exposure in the question ? __label__3 Do the titles of WP articles generally pass partisan judgment on the subject under discussion? Should they ? __label__3 What is the input? And what is line 73 ? __label__3 I also think it would be nice to leave the Snead article uncreated until game time. Then, as soon as he takes a snap, there can be a DYK saying something like "Did you know that <url> and ''<url>'' both took snaps in the innagural game of the <url>, the <url>?__label__3 Is your air conditioning running all day and not able to get the house temperature down to 78F? Or is it on and off (like normal expected operation) all day long ? __label__3 Hi, you removed links from "Microscope image processing" which I just added to resources which contain information on digital microsocopy. How to define their (ir-)relevance and justify their validity (or not) for inclusion / exclusion on this page ? __label__3 Agreed. Why do we even waste our time discussing afd ' s, if consensus has no bearing on the result ? __label__3 @Bobby thats exectly what i ' m trying to do..

What have you try, my friend ? __label__3 Assuming the domain of the hash function is larger than the range, that ' s impossible. If it ' s not, why bother using a hash ? __label__3 It turns out that the Zelda Collection you referred to in <url> didn ' t include aLttP, reportedly because the GBA remake was still being sold at that time, so that disc included NES and N64 emulation but left out SNES. Do you have another example ? __label__3 And in what form do you have that number? string ? __label__3 [[link](http://android . stackexchange . com / questions / 2968 / google - account - on - htc - desire - galaxy - tab)] this guy seems to be forced to fill a captcha forever and could not login using his account on a second phone.

Also, why do you need `insertable=false, updatable=false` in join column ? __label__3 assuming you have a list of 1 million numbers, as opposed to digits, do you need to modify this list, or just see if the number input by the user is in the list?

Sure, he argues passionately for his viewpoint, but hasn ' t everyone that was involved in that article done so, including myself ? __label__3 My only qualm, then, is that your question seems extremely specific, as I doubt anyone will be able to give you an answer without having experienced the exact same situation. Did you try to check what http://cyri . systemrequirementslab . com / CYRI/ think of your machine ? __label__3 @yacoby - I am going to write a little extension and am considering a addon for soapi that uses XHR for direct communication with the API. would this be of value to you ? __label__3 This guy made a huge number of changes within minutes of creating <url>, including some annoying ones in the church categorization pages which I ' m trying to clean up. Can we deal appropriately ? __label__3 Excuse me, but <url> seems to have slept through its normal editing period last night. Is it still working ? __label__3 please add to your question details of your graphics card `lspci | grep VGA` - also have a look in the Additional Drivers window - which nvidia driver is installed - and most importantly, is it activated? Does it say "activated but not in use"?__label__3 I note you also removed the statement that "Hurrell had been involved in previous altercations". Why ? __label__3 Hi Arcadian, regarding 'your' article on <url>, I think the classification as "hexose deoxy sugar" is clearly wrong, it would be rather something like "methyl ether of a branched heptose dideoxy sugar" but I ' m not sure how chemists usually refer to such substances. Could you shed light on the issure ? __label__3 As in my second comment..have you done some loggin to see where the application is hanging? Is the problem still the same if you don ' t run it from inside VS ? __label__3 I thought this problem (non - Latin characters being changed to ?? when people edit in certain browsers) had been fixed, but maybe there are browsers out there that don ' t support Unicode even with the fix ? __label__3 There are a few posts at <url> saying people are having trouble seeing the DYK picture that ' s up now.

It was obviously created by someone who didn ' t know how to use redirects, so would it not be best to just correct it ? __label__3 I responded to you on my talk page. A pity the WorldCat proposals you posted met with such deafening silence.. but can we claim that as implicit support ? __label__3 I don ' t understand what you mean.

Do you mean that the undirected version of the subgraph is a connected component, or that there ' s some source node of the subgraph from which all other nodes of the subgraph are reachable ? __label__3 @StrixVaria *A complete list of all German words and their meaning would be helpful.* we give him the phrases, but he wants the translation, then what? :)__label__3 Do you mean.. you want to have companyA . blogspot . com appear identical to companyb . blogspot . com? Or have the email postings, etc, be synonymous ? __label__3 The what? Can you include a link ? __label__3 This question is unclear. Please clarify it (add annotated screenshots?).__label__3 could you please tell what is your cpu and amount of your ram? and how many apps you install ? __label__3 You mean Properties? or the Autos / Locals / Watch window ? __label__3 I ' m sorry, that doesn ' t really make sense. What is your question ? __label__4 Your early edit ' s clearly indicate that you were not a newbie. How do explain this ? __label__4 I ' m curious. Why $65cm²$ ?__label__4 Also, how do you know it failed? You get an error message ? __label__4 He ' s doing it again, removing Lauren ' s "bottom 2" placing (<url>). I just reverted him but maybe we need to file something at AN / I ?__label__4 ??__label__4 very similar question: http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 1083017 / iphone - socket - program Have you tried searching with google or something ? __label__4 I don ' t know why claim that you reverted vandalism (rv edit summary) when to me they appeared to be good faith edits. What exactly was the vandalism ? __label__4 Just wondering, is there any reason why you removed categories from a number of articles and replaced them with the non - existend <url>. Wouldn ' t <url> have been the better choice, which, as it appears, is a category you yourself created a few days ago ? __label__4 Binary shift? Divide ? __label__4 How come you removed Dobby as an omitted character? Where does he appear ? __label__4 Great. Any reason why SCIRS is still an essay and not a content guideline ? __label__4  ' Buffering of video for multiple channels' sounds likely to be problematic - if you ' re saying that the client will receive all channels and show only one, in order that the user can switch between them quickly. Did you try posting to Stack Overflow ? __label__4 More time spent does not imply more dollars spent. If the decision is between having to pay five developers for a month or having customers wait 0 . 5s longer for a request, what would you choose ? __label__4 I pretty much agree with <url>, except I would like to know why you modified the see also section to be a hatnote. Doesn ' t <url> have specific requirements for this ? __label__4  / me scratches head. did you let VP access the internet through your firewall ? __label__4 I give a glimpse there now and then. What is up ? __label__4 I ' m wondering why in the <url> article, you keep changing the link <url> to <url> which just redirects to <url>? Why not just leave the link to point to the intended article directy ? __label__4 Most of time such a question is a sign of bad design. Why do you need dynamically assigned variable names ? __label__4 I installed it using pacman, but it still shows the error. It ' s written "Please install the build.." so do I also need to build it, or do I just need to reboot ? __label__4 This looks unnecessarily complicated. What are `prodsofar` and `listsofar` supposed to represent ? __label__4 It ' s not that, it ' s just feels .. wrong. An admin especially should be accountable for all his dealings, so why delete the history ? __label__4 the question lacks clarity. is this a mathematical question ? __label__4 @Rippo: Tried it and it doesn ' t work. Isn ' t the `$form . find('.person')` supposed to find all elements that have the `person` class inside the form with `personas` id ? __label__4 I suppose I should not have used rollback. I was aware of the problem, but you had not solved it, had you ? __label__4 It depends on language / platform. Or it doesn ' t matter ? __label__4 You mean "the higher solubility in the ocean"? Solubility of what ? __label__4 Your bot takes zh : u514bu91ccu65afu6258u5f17xb7u6885u7b56u723eu5fb7 off of the Christoph Metzelder page. What exactly is wrong with it ? __label__4 Just to let you know, you appear to have conducted the same blanking of links four times within a 24 - hour period, in three different instances. Shall I report you for this, or will you kindly restore the links ? __label__4 @Alexander I did not understand your last comment. Why can ' t you store positions ? __label__4 According to google this is likly to be a bug in your TeX distribution. What operating system and TeX distribution are you using ? __label__4 What is the purpose of having two switches? Why not just calculate the time between pulses from sw 0 ? __label__4 Hi Debresser, what ' s up? Why are you doing what you are doing ? __label__4 Do you have a specific question ? E . g. which part are you having difficulty with ?__label__4 For one phonological citation I need an uppercase "I", as in "Italy", with _serifs_ to distinguish it from lowercase L. You advised "The Classic skin uses a serifed font, if you can accept a personal solution." I ' m sorry, I don ' t catch your meaning. Where do I find the Classic skin, what is a personal solution, and why wouldn ' t I accept it ? __label__4 Since each polygon would overlay a polygon of the exact same shape, you really won ' t glean any benefit (that I can think of) from having multiple shapes. Are you doing this for something other than symbolizing features on a map ? __label__4 `a` cannot equal 2<sup>779</sup> in standard C or C++ unless you ' ve defined a custom numeric type. If you do have one, why not just **try it**?__label__4 Sure seems to work for me on FF 3 . 6, Chrome 7, IE 8.. http://jsfiddle . net / x3MMA/ (added a console . log to test). Are we missing some details of the problem ? __label__4 I ' d guess it ' s an archaic past tense of "to owe", i . e. "Which you owed yesterday"?__label__4 I don ' t really get the logic. What ' s similar about [2] and [5] and what ' s equal about titles..?__label__4  " Cactus League", eh? Let ' s see.. what does Liebman have in common with the type of pain you might get from a cactus needle ? __label__4 If the community decides that you no longer speak on its behalf--if the Wikipedia community decides that this supposed ban does not apply to constructive comments on AfDs on articles for which I am a major contributor, and that I may make such comments without asking for permission beforehand--who are you or anyone else to override that decision? I ' m not saying that anyone has or will make that decision--but if that decision is made, are you claiming that you are entitled to do what you want regardless of community consensus to the contrary ? __label__4 You seem to have an algorithm that works. What ' s the problem ? __label__4 I love the idea of getting a coffee when you ' re angry. Maybe you could mix it up occasionally and have a vodka + red bull ? __label__4 Ok, so could you be specific what is problematic for? Maybe show some code ? __label__4 So how come he can have all types of slandereous links on his wiki page? Don ' t you think being an admin you should delete them ? __label__4 Why voted down? Fair enough question, yes ? __label__4 I am concern why this user never replies to messages left on her talk page. Does she talk ? __label__4 What do you mean? How am I supposed to vindicate myself of this ridiculous accusation ? __label__4 Tell us what type of coating. Is it a dry whitish streaks or spots? Is it clear but has a texture ? __label__4 I ' m not sure I understand your question. Can you put the first sentence into a complete sentence ? __label__4 Why bother with the `.php` in the rewritten URLs? Why not just `/course _ view`?__label__4 I was under the impression that it was also more efficient (less air resistance in the ductwork). Is that not the case ? __label__4 What part of that is supposed to be case insensitive? The comparison with "Alaska"?__label__4 what can i do about that? Make a new one??__label__4 Can you explain what you mean by ''"Randi, paranormal, Larry King etc. are all redundant redundant"''?__label__4 I have also put speedy delete tags on <url> and <url>. Was there any particular reason to move your user / user talk pages to that name, and back again ? __label__4 Could we have a question concerning the GPL without discussions about whether the GPL is good or bad sometime? Please ? __label__4 <url> is one of the three fundamental Wikipedia content policies; why is it a "shame" you have to follow it? What did you mean by "people like you"?__label__4  " invertHash", I suppose. But honestly, why does it matter what you name your own functions ? __label__4 Well, I suppose it is only reasonable for you to conclude that everyone behaves as you and your allies do. If "good typography" is whatever Dicklyon likes, why shouldn ' t the truth be whatever subserves Dicklyon ' s cause ? __label__4 Also, what time are you synchronising? And why ? __label__4 It ' s worth noting that in some companies, the line between "design" and "marketing" is imaginary. What becomes of your question when the person who does design is also involved in marketing ? __label__4 Try to get the terminology right, there really isn ' t such a thing as POST and GET variables, especially not on the client side (which I assume you are referring to). So what exactly do you mean ? __label__4 I never understand why people get annoyed at Python ' s required indenting. I *hope* you were going to indent your code anyway, right ? __label__4 Change them to what? If that is your input, what is your desired output ? __label__4 Hmm. Over ? __label__4 I assume you like to play ''U . S.'' billiards bottom right corner ? __label__4 That user <url> moved <url> page for no reason and I do not understand why it was moved or why a persistent vandalist like this was allowed to move it. Is there anyway at all to get it moved back and that user permanently banned ? __label__4 Are you running the latest update (10 . 5 . 8 or 10 . 6 . 5?). Is 'bluetooth devices can wake up' enabled ? __label__4 O ( n) is trivial. Is it possible to do this faster ? __label__4 I didn ' t have those in <person> because they were already included under the tributaries categories. Is this one of those "basketball player" exceptions ? __label__4 and the language of your choice is? and the form of your input is ? __label__4 You ' ve been asking the ''sensible'' sysops..!?__label__4 @Pax: would you really call this a _basic_ question? Considering it depends on the alignment of the instruction bytes ? __label__4 "..without considerably more context" - I am sorry for being, perhaps, too annoying, but your last words give me some hope that "speaking tings" is still possible under some very very specific circumstances, some broader context. Can you, please, try to come up with such context ? __label__4 Why have you cut out the interesting bit from the Apache confs? Where ' s the `ServerName`/`ServerAlias` stuff ? __label__4 I feel I ' m on the receiving end of a cross - cultural dialect issue :) What geographic location is this relevant to ? __label__4 COI? What COI do you think I have ? __label__4 @T . E . D.: Um..thank you ? __label__4 In your most recent edit to <url> you stated that the track in Clermont, Florida does not fulfill IAAF regulations (since reverted by another editor).

If the image is already the correct size ? __label__4 Oh, and I checked your user page, as you requested. Perhaps you could help me understand why your "spouses don ' t confer nobility" argument doesn ' t apply to <url>?__label__4 Are you using Perl 5? If you are, why are you writing for Perl 4 ? __label__4 If you are insecure about your pet IDE being criticized, then by all means, step up and defend it. How do I define a custom key binding in eclipse ? __label__4  " Odder" in what sense? Also, why are you still delaying ? __label__4 Not enough details. What programming problem do you have ? __label__4 somthing missing in your question! what forms you want to turn to ? __label__4 Also, the last time you asked this, 100 worked but 190 didn ' t work. Why the change ? __label__4 Yeah, I already noticed that. Why can ' t people can just edit in a responsible fashion, or through ''discussion with others''?__label__4 Since your last warning to BigBang19, he ' s continued to vandalize the ''Punk ' d'' article, undoing the grammatical corrections I made some time ago, and inserting irrelevant, non - noteworthy material about Kuthcer ' s observence of Jewish holidays and his marriage to Demi Moore. Can someone block this person for a period of more than just 24 hours so that he gets the message ? __label__4 How are these inconsistent with the traditional account of the origins of the Torah involving redactions as late as Ezra? Why do we need bizarre hypotheses about documents being interwoven that are contrary to all known examples of how books are written ? __label__4 Hey there; I saw that you took the time to edit the Valletta article, but didn ' t remove user Jasalf ' s edit. How so ? __label__4 The instructions you linked mention using Visual C++ Express, yet your output tells that distutils tries to use gcc. What are you actually using ? __label__4 Looks like you ' ve installed vmware. Did you try to disable / uninstall vmware ? __label__4 It ' s simple Pumpie. Why don ' t you try to understand all parts, or write in your own language ? __label__4 This is what you wrote: "In the book 'Inventing Elliot' written by Graham Gardener, the book, 1948 is mentioned numerous times." What book, 1948??__label__4 Thanks for reverting that obnoxious vandalism on my talk page. How do I bring in an administrator to deal with the vandal ? __label__4 maybe you can start with useing code tags. and i don ' t see how the frame loads the pics ? __label__4 Why did you edit out my 'Hi', and 'Thanks'? Is common courtesy not allowed any more ? __label__4 Whats wrong with `foreach($array as $key => $value)`? Or, asked the other way around, what ' s the point using `foreach($array as $value)` when you actually need `$key` somewhere down the road ? __label__4 I don ' t think anybody wants the stale uninformative old Victorian results infoboxes. Can you gain consensus before deviating ? __label__4 I ' m not clear on something. Is this taking place _before_ or _after_ the hatches are open ? __label__4 You mean other than when things like taste, heat tolerance, health, etc are factors? Or is that what you are asking ? __label__4 Im not really sure what you are up to. Chances are that you would like to do something as asked in [this question](http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 4924350)?__label__4 You changed the result here: Weu2019ve already had <url>; do you really want to do it again? The result given is a compromise; are you wanting to upset that ? __label__4 The "shaped bokeh" effect is a special case.

Do you have links to other similar apps ? __label__4 what doesn ' t work about it? can you provide some example js in your post to demonstrate it not working ? __label__4 And if you use Coulson you would probably have to say "According to Coulson..". Have you read <url> yet ? __label__4 `data . find` ? no error ? __label__4 This seems to be an elementary / homework - level question. @mehas: could you please provide some motivation and explain why you are interested in this question ? __label__4 A _variable_ has scope; an _object_ has a lifetime. What exactly are you asking about ? __label__4 What do you mean by "equivalent value"?? Are you just looking for a linear function like that in @phimuemue ' s answer ? __label__4 I still don ' t understand what you want to do. What do you mean by "reorder the sequence in which the pixel intensity data comes"?__label__4 <url> is a validly notable topic which has been ruthlessly suppressed at WP, probably because of egoism rather than religionist POV warriors but possibly both. Can you advise me on how to go about appealling deletions ? __label__4 That ' s not clear, what kind of distance? You mean orthogonal distance from a side of original rectangle to another one ? __label__4 1. Could you please give us a small but complete example showing the problem. 2.

Can ' t one manage all the data to be changed in a stream to the applet directly, or AJAX javascript ? __label__4 Nvidia dedicated graphics chip? Could you be more specific ? __label__4 To me these two bits of TeX look identical after they ' re rendered. Can you explain the advantage of the latter format (since you ' ve made a point of changing from the first to the second form in some articles)?__label__4 If you know how to get the bits into a string, then do that, and get the first five of them using a substring. Which part do you need help with ? __label__4 What is / are "all monthy in whay"? Are you trying to state that you need to list all values in January along with their sum ? __label__4 CIV, I ' ll grant (and yes, I shouldn ' t have).

Imagine if he was ? __label__4 I ' m not sure how you ' re having this problem - Ctrl+Shift+Left / Right cursor jumps text and highlights. What programs are you experiencing this issue in ? __label__4 Sorry, we were discussing iPad, but we did go through the overall state of Apple ' s products.

He break the 3RR rule ? __label__4 Your question is too vague. What do you want to achieve exactly, and what did you already tried ? __label__4 @eWolf: Sorry, I didn ' t have a chance to install the XNA framework. Have you considered listing your application on [StackList](http://stacklist . quickmediasolutions . com/)?__label__4 @hakre: I don ' t understand how I can circumvent the "that" by using physical media in distribution.

How do we do that ? __label__4 No, just admire them from a distance of a couple of centuries! You ? __label__4 <url> - You made a bold edit, I reverted and now we discuss.

What ' s up ? __label__4 There ' s an interesting discussion here: <url>. Care to explain ? __label__4 I ' ve never seen something go beyond AN / I myself, and I find it hard to believe the other two hadn ' t been tried by now. Or is it a case - by - case thing ? __label__4 Could you please clarify with an example? And are we doing your homework for you ? __label__4 Yes, I just saw that.

Why does your goal not include these ? __label__4 why not `fprintf`? is this a homework ? __label__4 Do you have a Flickr Pro account? Could it be that you ' ve got close to your monthly usage allowance this month ? __label__4 I have listened to the beginning for your recording of Thomas Jefferson and nothing is mentioned that Thomas Jefferson owned slaves or Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings. Why ? __label__4 How do you mean 'sorting a string'? Do you mean sorting a list of strings ? __label__4 Okay. What, exactly, can I do about that ? __label__4 I ' m unclear on what you ' re asking; is the registry entry _not_ deleting (or returning after you ' ve deleted it). Or is the debugger prompt still appearing despite having deleted the registry setting ? __label__4 This question is almost word - for - word, the same as http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 3624056/ . Is this homework ? __label__4 Also, that photo isn ' t showing up for me. Can anyone else see it ? __label__4 <url>??__label__4  - 1: A bad question. The real question is "how do I concatenate file names?"__label__4 You ' re acting very oddly today: You ' ve just reverted two separate edits on <url>, saying they were the phrasing of the Lancet, but neither references the Lancet, and it seems unlikely that both would have the same statement applying to them. Have you been hacked ? __label__4 See my answer in <url>. Is there some problem ? __label__4 I can ' t read IPA. Can you add the IPA meanings for those vowel sounds to the answer, please ? __label__4 I notice you are still contributing to Wikipedia, but have not responded to my argument. Do you now agree with the argument I suggested ? __label__4 Well, you look in Data::Compare and see what they do. Why don ' t you want to use that module ? __label__4 hmm.. wait a minute.. hmm.. what?!__label__4 Why is this closed? The asker is looking for organised week - long rides. He could expand his question a bit, give more details of the type of ride he is looking for, but otherwise, why ? __label__4 Good question, worded poorly. Might want to try rephrasing it ? __label__4 Actually, material in the lead must be discussed in the body. Contemporary economics haven ' t been discussed in the body, so how can they be discussed in the lead ? __label__4 <url> Well there is no name to the byline, which an article in a newspaper usually has, op - ed or editorials not so much. Do you not think you should have gone to talk before reverting btw ? __label__4 This is a standard homework problem for an undergrad QM course. Do we really want questions like this and answers to them on MO ? __label__4 Why do you need to do another `ls`? Why don ' t you just print the results from the first `ls`?__label__4 Not too sure now you come to mention it. Do i need to annihilate it ? __label__4 The Nyan Cat is a flying cat with a toast instead of its body. Isn ' t quite similar ? __label__4 Are u the guy on TV Forum using the same name??__label__4 Nice tune Modernist <url>. You owe me one back ? __label__4 @codeka - 4 in all of those bases is still 4. A more interesting question would be, what base is "10"? :P__label__4 I ' m no expert on the language, but on the face of it that dab page disambiguates two words which are unambiguous anyway - Zakhmet and Khachpas. Am I missing something ? __label__4 This feels like a duplicate of http://programmers . stackexchange . com / questions / 217 / should - i - keep - realbasic - on - my - resume and maybe we could make that question general. (Should I keep X on my resume?)__label__4 Is there any reason you keep moving boldface marks? ITN is on my watchlist and you seem to do this quite frequently, yet, as far as I can see, it makes no difference, so I feel compelled to ask if there ' s any particular reason ? __label__4 One the the main reasons I ask for a citation is to learn precisely what is meant by "the consistency of the reals". You haven ' t heard anything about this, Trovatore, have you ? __label__4 What do you mean 'same operation'? Is @myArray shared ? __label__4 Hi. The original link (http://ww . lgso . org . uk / index . htm) gives a 404 error, but the amended URL (http://ww . lgso . org . uk/) works for me, so why do you say it ' s still dead ? __label__4 That ' s impossible to say without knowing your reason to consider a change. What are you looking for ? __label__4 This is starting to almost feel like harassment. Perhaps we should take this to a mediation committee ? __label__4 I believe that an opinion about AS belongs only to article about AS (and you are welcome to cite the MS opinion ''in proper context''). However an opinion about MS belongs only to article about MS. Is not this fair and logical ? __label__4 I ' m baffled. What point is there being unblocked only to file an appeal that C has already decided to reject ? __label__4 Never heard of this before. I guess you ' ve already tried a full repair and it ' s still happening ? __label__4 SuaveArt has edited his post on the Wikipedia Review and is now lying about me. Did you see the actual post there before he changed it so you can back up my cut - n - paste of what it said ? __label__4 You don ' t have any call to `fork()` in your sample program. Is this intentional ? __label__4 One side question: It sounds like your yard slopes towards your house. Assuming you don ' t already have any water problems, could adding a deck (which could trap some of the moisture) cause a problem ? __label__4 Ruby on Rails runs at the server side. So how about using that ? __label__4 BS of course you can. And I have tried Firebug..same fustration..cant get it to work either..want to teach me how to use it??__label__4 <url>! Shall we greet him as he deserves ? __label__4 very unclear - what is it you want to do?? Upload images to a WCF service and store them in SQL Server ? __label__4 OTRS. At this point why not try ? __label__4 Ah, as I recall it was ''you'' who confused me on that one, by adding them to <url> during the GA review ;) What is the preferred display quote? Does one just use blockquote ? __label__4 So you are still sidestepping the question. Please answer it directly: please answer my question, clearly: are you saying is that you cannot use the wiki to edit cooperatively with other people on the same text, or are you saying that you can use the wiki as it was intended and edit a single text cooperatively ? __label__4 And it ''takes'' thousands and thousands of dollars to run a campaign, so exactly what ' s your point? Has there actually been some evidence of wrongdoing on anyone ' s part ? __label__4 Your second code snippet is the same as the first. Did you not paste it in correctly ? __label__4 Your title mentions relativity, but your question body does not. Could you resolve this for us please ? __label__4 Just to let you know, there ' s a <url> now. I don ' t know, is this mimicry allowed on Wikipedia ? __label__4 My job. Do you have any specific points to address ? __label__4 Right, but thats 24KB when served via gzip, but on my file browser it shows 78kb. The other file should be MUCH LESS in size when served via gzip because its already 32KB as my file browser shows, no ? __label__4 Also, why is this glorious photo of a <url> not used in any articles? Was there some argument about its copyright status ? __label__4 If input is {{a: 1, b: 1}, {c: 1}, {b: 1, c: 1}}, do you just want {{a: 1, b: 1} , {c: 1}}, or all 3? If it ' s the former, what exactly do you need this for ? __label__4  " I ' ve found these packages being imported by the model:" The model? To what do you refer ? __label__4 You said other sources supported the info in the infobox yet you did not indicate what sources. And why can ' t we use a primary source for his birth date ? __label__4 Why do you need randomness? Why can ' t you use sequential strings ? __label__4 But he ' s still a WHU registered player with a squad number. Is that really the right thing to do ? __label__4 Clarification: Do you mean to run the container itself under a hot tap? Is the result really "good as new?"__label__4 @IVIAD: "Is Not My Vehicle Maybe his Yellow Mazda and Listen, Sir.. Aardvarks instill OBESITY!" Am I right ? __label__4 Makes me wanna ask, what do you say about having separate articles like Wikipedia has <url> and <url> or <url> and <url>? Should this be tolerated for non - Transformers stuff ? __label__4 These are my numbers: 7 years in Wikipedia, 6 years as an admin, 570+ articles, 4 featured articles, 1 featured list, 21 Good articles, 60 DYK ' s - After six years as an admin. I recently made some mistakes and I can understand if I am placed in some type of probation were I am monitored and forbidden to use my tools maybe for a year, but do I really merit the removal of my adminship ? __label__4 Please rephrase your question using full words and complete sentences. Also, what does assembly have to do with this ? __label__4 Yes, this is the English Wikipedia so we use the English version of the infobox. And can there once be a time when you don ' t find your way to my talk a complain ? __label__4 Pat, for someone who has died, you don ' t say "he is a former professional baseball player", you say "he was a professional baseball player". Okay ? __label__4 Hi I noticed you speedied and article but not it ' s talk page? What ' s the use of leaving the talk page, discussion or no, if you ' re going to speedy the article ? __label__4 Fatwa? What is that ? __label__4 You need to narrow the problem down. Is your question actually "how do I update an entity reference in EF"?__label__4 Umm, it was renamed to <url> as you proposed. Is there something wrong ? __label__4 Sorry :) I dont want to hack the system!! :) is there another way ? __label__4 OK, I give up? What notability is asserted ? __label__4 Hmm, that ' s what I get too: |O - E|/sqrt ( E) = |17 - 16 . 5|/16 . 5 = 0 . 123. Can you add a link to the paper if it ' s available on the web ? __label__4 <url>.. it doesn ' t really explain what the issue was. Can you word it better ? __label__4 Just to be sure, are you talking about ST as found in clinical trials, e . g. http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Sequential _ analysis ? __label__4 @leppie so this is ambigious? Why? Because of the loop ? __label__4 I ' m not sure about this, but I assume that in commercial yoghurt, there is a lot of sugar added. Did you add any ? __label__4  [ This thread](http://forum . archosfans . com / viewtopic . php ? f=35 & t=17511) on an archos 5 mentions turning off the "static IP" setting on the device. Does your device have that setting ? __label__4 It looks like these are the cases, not actual references. Am I wrong ? __label__4 You didn ' t answer about the status of above mentioned image. Are you going to tag that image too ? __label__4 @David, No, I don ' t. Why do you ask ? __label__4 You seemed, to me, to be addressing all of us who were opposed to your merger. Do you know a different meaning for "oddwater" other than "urine"?__label__4 Afterthought: where did you get your figure of 82500 tons pa??__label__4 I ' d like to ask why you ' re so insistent on creating a page called <url>, which means the same thing as <url>. Are you disagreeing that they mean the same thing, do you feel that the <url> article is bad, or do you feel that <url> is a better name for the article ? __label__4 Solve for `x`? Is there a dividebyzero . com in the SO family of sites ? __label__4 When am I changing nationalities? I do remove flags when I encounter them per <url> and <url>, but changing them..?__label__4 I don ' t quite understand. Why don ' t you use ${resource} and pass it to the frontend ? __label__4 I have to say, I ' ve reviewed the suggestions that "year in x" not be piped, and I vehemently disagree. As I note on the [[Wikipedia talk : Piped link|talk page]], "[s ] ee [[Lindsay Lohan]] for a good example of why piping is a good thing (a simple [&#91 ; 2003 in film]] in line would create clunky, hard - to - follow writing & mdash ; better to use no links at all)." Comment ? __label__4 Why avoid it? Is "November 6,<br>2010" somehow a more desired rendering than "6 November<br>2010"?__label__4 Having said that, I don ' t want to drive anyone away just because they can ' t write well. The question is, where do you begin ? __label__4 How come you have a need to to _ str on a name? Isn ' t a string already ? __label__4 This looks suspiciously like homework. Could you elaborate a little more ?__label__4 Hot d * mn, this is more complicated than I thought at first. Week 1 is the week that contains the calendar year ' s first *Thursday*!?!__label__4 Do you really think it is necessary to do that? Could you not simply take my advice on board ? __label__4 I don ' t think the name ' s gonna help much since whatever I ' ve played is going to be the Dutch translation. The cow shooting part had something to do with counting though, right ? __label__4 Really? Why ? __label__4 Lemme just remember, who ' s going to be mentioned first? Snyder, or the failed projects ? __label__4 Also, could you please explain the second scenario a little ? how is that possible ?__label__4 Maybe it ' s necessary to phrase this another way: is there any food that *everybody* can eat ? __label__4 What part of that are you confused about? [this](http://ww . quirksmode . org / js / this . html)?__label__4 See my comments on the article ' s talk page, which is on my watchlist by the way. Be bold ? __label__4 Your <url> give your first edit as on April 9, 2011. Do you have any other account you have not disclosed yet ? __label__4 The edit might make the question more relevant to more people. Maybe or maybe not ? __label__4 I had to revert another one <url>. How about that protection ? __label__4 Would you know what the difference is between 'computing by Operating systems' and 'operating systems"? Not obvious to me, why not just eliminate it and add the computing category to the operating systems category page ? __label__4 Would it be a better question if it were "Why are Perl threads so $#@$&!*@# slow compared to other languages?"__label__4 @Emtucifor: My point is simply that if you ' re going to clutch your pearls this tight and go all " _O tempora o mores!_ " on us, it ' s more convincing if you yourself don ' t exemplify the decline of standards you are bemoaning. If you don ' t hold yourself to a standard of perfection, then what could possibly be the point of your question ? __label__4 Soo, what ' s the problem? Do you get an error when trying to compile the code ? __label__4 What benefits would you have from doing it? I think it is more trouble than it ' s worth.. After all, the names should be read by the users anyway, shouldn ' t they ? __label__4 I am the third party; <url> was the first to dispute its use. Why can ' t you describe the changes in words ? __label__4 Show more declarations, what is the type of the curr _ time2 variable? How is the get _ time _ in _ seconds() function declared ? __label__4 Hey Love, as you wish, if you have any suggestions about my section, let me know. Is English a second language for you ? __label__4 Can you clarify please? What you want to do is change `some . email@gmail . com` to `this . other . email@gmail . com`, without changing any other information and retaining your accumulated messages ? __label__4 Oh..it is a spider with 'pajek'. Is it really necessary ? __label__4 Why do you need to do this? Why is having the row id sequential important and necessary ? __label__4 Why is your code stored in a `.cpp` (C++) file, while the question is about C? So, what is it C++ or C ? __label__4 @hippietrail: Truncated how? and on what OS ? __label__4 Could you provide more details , the summary of that question seems to be that special characters are ignored in google search which applies to this case. Is this the start of an expression ?__label__4 Flush ? Do you mean flash ?__label__4 *@RealityCramp* - I have read your question several times and while I think I understand what you might be asking I ' m at a loss regarding the details. Can you please rephrase your question ? __label__4 That ' s a couple levels of automation beyond my experience. But if you just got the idea today, then how can you know the false positive level is low enough for WP : AWB / Typos ? __label__4 Which way are you trying to identify it? From within code ? __label__4 Hmm, Apple software on Windows question. I guess the "Apple Software" part defines the fact that you posted it here ? __label__4 I ' m confused. You don ' t have the original assets ?__label__4 Time to register and start giving some votes to the people that are giving you free consulting. All : Is a feature on Stackoverflow that if a user doesn ' t register that there is no calculation of acceptance rate ? __label__4 An important concept in Rails is REST and how websites should respond to requests. Why do you want to delete the ever useful edit route from that resource ? __label__4 You are wasting a lot of power in the 150 ohm resistors. What is the 55 for ? __label__4  " If any database errors occur, they will be emailed to the address specified here." Do u get any emails??__label__4 the last one doesn ' t work if i ' m working on battery power Is their a solution for this ? __label__4 That ' s still not the original source, and after searching through a few pages on Flickr, I ' m assuming the original is all rights reserved anyway. Can I ask why you believe it is public domain ? __label__4 How do you know it ' s not returning a 64 - bit pointer? Have you done `sizeof ( void *)` to check ? __label__4 User 86 . 138 . 232 . 97 does have a history of malicous edits. Are you then confirming that these malicious edits done by user 86 . 138 . 232 . 97 were done by yourself ? __label__4 Wouldn ' t R and C just be fixed numbers? What error are you getting ? __label__4 He used it to assert that ''others'' had expressed the notion that the process was concluded and that it was time to move on, and used your statement as evidence of this. Since you did not mean that it had been concluded, and since obviously you were only speaking for yourself and no one else, and participants have been continuing to post on the RfC page and its Talk Page to indicate that they do not feel this way at all, how does it serve to support the idea that they have ? __label__4 can you really fix velocity and number of vehicles and vary the area? It does not look like it is possible to do controlled experiment in your case, can you please clarify ? __label__4 umm, it ' s a soft redirect. A placeholder for a future page .. Is there a problem ? __label__4 Hi RHM22. Would you or one of your coin - loving compatriots have access to <url>?__label__4 Nobody is actually addressing the question being asked here. Is it that vital to ensure the wheel is centered? Can it really be destroyed by riding slightly off - center ? __label__4 So? what is the question? "The code ' s not working", is that the question ? __label__4 Hey Geek Could U pls guide me to start learning the basics of flurry analytics in android? Where can i find its tutorial kind of things ? __label__4 Not my question, but okay. Would you care to elaborate on this and tell me what exactly is wrong ? __label__4 The answer is "one citation per city". Information must always be verifiable; without verifiable sources for say, Unna, how exactly are we to tell that the article is accurate ? __label__4 Delegates don ' t work!? Do you use Control . BeginInvoke() method to invoke delegates ? __label__4 @Henning Makholm- That does not seem obvious. Can you explain why ? __label__4 I ' ve been trying to do the opposite: decrease the sensitivity below the minimum. Have you had any luck with your attempts ? __label__4 ED, eh? Have they tried Viagra ? __label__4 Do you mean it literally says "Unknown Sender?" Or the number is just unfamiliar to you ? __label__4 Do you have perfect knowledge of the meetings before hand, ie who will be there and in what order the meetings occur? Or, do you have to process meetings as you get them ? __label__4 The computer may have multiple disks and multiple partitions, each one with one different file system. Do you want to know the type of root partition or what ? __label__4 Yes, that was really necessary. What ' s wrong with establishing uniformity in CASH articles ? __label__4 What do you mean by "one edit war away"? And whats a siteban ? __label__4 As I said in the summary when moving him away from <url>, for the last twenty - six years of his life he wasn ' t a priest. Perhaps I ' ve missed the part of the naming convention which requires 'priest', could you please say more ? __label__4 I can ' t repro, have you tried decompressing the payload with gzip? Is it valid ? __label__4 Why do you need 200 variables? Why not have one array with 200 elements ? __label__4 @Qmal: why don ' t you want it? Any reason ? __label__4 .. not possible to my knowledge. Any reason you want something like that ? __label__4 I am puzzled that you just deleted the file 'harry potter stamps'. This file seems to have existed for two years without deletion, so perhaps you could explain the grounds for speedy deletion ? __label__4 @Koper, in order to program this algorithm, I need to understand what the algorithm does. How is it *not* related to programming ? __label__4 Given all the software tools out there (IDEs, refactoring tools, text search tools etc.) why do you want to write this from scratch yourself ? __label__4 Why are you trying to exchange data between component in the same system via a file? Why not use a temporary file to create a mock file ? __label__4 Stick it in dynamically from where? You just need it to be a global js var ? __label__4 Using Apache? How about mod _ security ? __label__4 Which software? which version ? __label__4 I ' m sure there is, along with a million other clever optimizations. But I really doubt they ' re caching the *results* of my search, so I ' m still curious - what algorithm are they using to actually obtain the result list ? __label__4 I will find religious advocacy statements. You don ' t understand, or disagree, that medical issues are over emphasized in the circumcision article ? __label__4 Vi is out of the hospital. Did I mention that she was in ? __label__4 No more saga! Help me by keeping this page the way it is right now, alright ? __label__4 There is no image attached. Also, what have you tried by yourself ? __label__4 Hi, although I agree with you, please check the following <url> in process.

What doesn ' t work ? __label__4 I usually just boil water and then drink but I think it won ' t help here. Does it ? __label__4  " I will be retiring to the Cayman Islands shortly with the riches I ' m gathering through my Wikipedia editing of political pages." - ''(From your userpage)'' - You ' re joking, right? Oh, and you ' re also joking about being a Republican too ? __label__4 I ' m going to walk you through this one very simply. Let ' s start here: Is there currently, or has there ever been a cartoon broadcast on television by the name of the Breakfast Monkey ? __label__4 And the username? Do you have any thoughts on changing it to something not involving Nazism ? __label__4 This question does not seem to make sense. You say both ends are routers, so assuming you set the routes correctly, and the routers are gateways, what is the question ? __label__4 Short answer is yes. Did you want to know something more specific ? __label__4 Where are you sorting `dateArray`? Or you aren ' t doing it right now ? __label__4 OK, now I ' m curious. Why isn ' t this a syntax error ? __label__4 I noticed you added the Jean Chretien link to the homepage, which is nice, but you didn ' t put any comment for the changelog and you also didn ' t bump of the last article, you bumped off the 2nd last article. Why ? __label__4 It seems <url> has tagged the following baiting articles <url> <url> <url> and <url> with a delete tag out of spite. It there a way to remedy this type of poor behaviour ?__label__4 Career advice questions like this one are too localized for this site. Please see [Are Career Advice questions useful for anyone except the poster](http://meta . programmers . stackexchange . com / questions / 588 / are - career - advice - questions - useful - to - anyone - except - the - poster / 590 # 590)?__label__4 Hi, sorry I think I ' m missing something here. Why are you adding a red link to the vandalism page ? __label__4 i cant see that map service. I assume its dynamic and not cached ? __label__4 Please provide the example of what you want to achieve. What exactly you do not get ? __label__4 Email checked and responded to. If you can ' t respond here, could you at least leave me a note to check my email ? __label__4 I added commentary.

That being said, have you tried to turn off remote debugging for the SWF you don ' t want to allow debugging on ? __label__4 Are you the owner of hacktolive . org? If not, what ' s your relationship to it ? __label__4 One more thing, you have a fellow Budgie insisting a losing appearance in an FA Cup semi is an "Honour" for your club. I guess it ' s because you haven ' t won much lately, but really, a losing semi - finalist isn ' t an honour in the real sense of the word, is it ? __label__4 Your code isn ' t going to work anyway. How can `tags` contain a new instance of the tag object ? __label__4 What is your relation to these authors? Are you writing a package, or editing a publication ? __label__4 Why do you contend that New Atheism and Atheism 3 . 0 are unrelated? They are so intermingled that people have difficulty discerning which is which ? __label__4 i can input number, number1. skips to letter2 why ? __label__4 Your error message tells us nothing. Do you have a detailed log --perhaps you can run it from the command line (as Ravi replied below) and paste the error messages ? __label__4 I ' d assume it ' s a ban on this account, that was used by multiple people. I don ' t think you would be blocked because you at one point edited on this account, and as long as you don ' t use the same IP, I don ' t think you could be blocked, how whould anyone know ? __label__4 Huh?! You really want to use browser - side JS to create a cookie, receive it with server - side PHP, and store in a cookie . jar file for use with PHP ' s curl library ? __label__4 Yes, I can change the font. Could you please provide me with an example ? __label__4 This is a rant why you do not want to use LaTeX, not a question. So, what exactly is your question ? __label__4 Why was <url> deleted when it was simply a crop of <url> which is public domain? I ' m pretty sure I wrote that on the description page, but if not, can it be restored ? __label__4 I ' ve also started <url>. Now is this acceptable ? __label__4 <url> seems a bit bizarre. Why nowrap date fields in cite templates ? __label__4 Well, that ' s probably going to be an annoying AfD. How about <url> and <url>?__label__4 No doubt, some comments are crazy. But getting rid of **all* comments ? __label__4 Sorry to ask a stupid question, but.. What exactly is this thing ? __label__4 schoolwork? it ' s a strange query, don ' t you have more information for us ? __label__4 What language are you looking for? C / C++?__label__4 I have no idea what to tag this. Ideas ? __label__4 Is there a reason you dont just let IIS do this for you? Or use the `<authorization>` features in your web . config ? __label__4 Better is entirely subjective with nothing more specific. What do you photograph, what are your priorities ? __label__4 possible duplicate of [Simple algorithm for online outlier detection of a generic time series](http://stats . stackexchange . com / questions / 1142 / simple - algorithm - for - online - outlier - detection - of - a - generic - time - series) This question is proposed to be closed as a duplicate. Could you please let us know at the meta thread if and how your context is different from the question I linked ? __label__4 You really should give us more information. How does the user create an account for example ? __label__4 You speedy - delete - tagged <url> and <url> as <nowiki><person></nowiki>. What maintenance work were you weanting to do with them ? __label__4 I see that you closed that CfD discussion as rename, but haven ' t actually renamed the categories. What ' s up with that ? __label__4 If you ' re talking about the Recycling Troll, I ' ve never blocked him. Why do you think I have ? __label__4 You added partisan colours for the early Chancellors (such as a conservative blue colour for Bismarck); as the early Chancellors were not attached to any political party, and the "party" given is merely an approximate indication of their political leanings, I ' m not sure if this is a good idea. Also, why did you remove the partisan colour from the last part of the table (the Republic)?__label__4 Wait, my previous comment may have been jumping the gun.. What is it you ' re trying to do? Get access to someone else ' s record, or go for the bigger SQL Injection vulnerability there ? __label__4 Why are you installing rubygems 1 . 3 . 7 and watir 1 . 6 . 5. Why don ' t you install a current version of rubygems and watir gems ? __label__4  " I ' ve simply been told before that itsa flow of electrons, but this seems to basic and does show that electricity is instant." Why would this mean that electricity is "instantaneous" ?__label__4 Hello, Jacob Rockowitz; welcome on _Drupal Answers_. For which Drupal version are you interested ? __label__4 Sorry, I don ' t really understand what you want it to do. Why would you hold it to your ear while dialing, and what does that have to do with vibrating on answering a call ? __label__4 Editing pattern just means, have you made more than 3R in 24h. Why should S get blocked, when S didn ' t break 3RR ? __label__4 The Magix software doesn ' t work on Linux. Did you install it in Wine or do you mean a different application ? __label__4 Can I ask: was this really the implication that you intended in making this change?

Which version of VS (they have different levels of js intellisense support)?__label__4 You made me work at that a little too hard. Next time, could you provide a link to the algorithm that you ' re using, or at least give us the name of the algorithm ? __label__4 The question isn ' t clear. Is it a video of two stars in the sky ? __label__4 Could you clarify what you think the problem with `Digest::MD5` might be? If you can ' t, why don ' t you just use it ? __label__4 I figured I would ask you directly, since you objected to my original draft, and it seems to be difficult to workshop specific problems in the general discussion taking place at <url>. How is <url>?__label__4 What is a wall these days? 10 sentences ? __label__4 Sounds like 'can anyone show me how to iterate over array and execute function on each element'. What ' s the problem with iterating it step by step, just as you described ? __label__4 I think you need some more examples, cause I still don ' t understand what you ' re trying to do. What about longer arrays and a different number of elements to select ? __label__4 Okay, where can it go then? The list of episodes ? __label__4 What ' s your issue with noting the copyright registration date for this piece? Also, could you point me to the consensus you mentioned ? __label__4 You can narrow this down a bit; are you on a mountain bike? A road bike? A 16" folding bike ? __label__4 Yet you did violate <url> and could be blocked right now. If that edit recurred, would you revert it again ? __label__4 LOL, I can ' t believe you reverted Kizzle ' s deletion of my summary at S & aQ. Did you actually like my summary ? __label__4 @Sorin: If it ' s just a simple script, then why do you need "syntactic sugar" at all? Is it pure vanity (*"..but I want it to work this way because it looks much nicer"*) or is there any technical reason that you cannot simply use the methods that are already there ? __label__4 @Marc: Wow. Was it obvious that aali was a sockpuppet account ? __label__4 You are removing the film poster s images from the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards articles and the Academy awards. Why ? __label__4 The reason given on the <nowiki><person></nowiki> tag (''"Non - notable book promo"'') seems to have nothing at all to do with the article. Is this on the correct article ? __label__4 Have you ever been able to connect to a WLAN at all? Or did you never succeed ? __label__4 Why can ' t your second snippet just `return result`? Or at least, if Yes or No or Cancel, `return result`?__label__4 Hi. I would argue that a consensus is far from being reached, so I ' m wondering why you have went ahead and starting changing links ? __label__4 @martin . malek — I ' ve edited the title. Does that accurately reflect what you ' re looking for ? __label__4 Do you really need to do it using web application ? __label__4 Okay, let ' s leave the naming thing posponed for now, why are you reverting the <url>-catagory thing? just because (as you say) Iraq was formed post - WWI that doesn ' t mean that they aren ' t the same people ? __label__4 |style="vertical - align: top; border - top: 1px solid gray;" | For creating an article on a relatively obscure bridge with interesting information that remains in the current article, which has become the focus of the world for all the wrong reasons, I hereby award you this oddball barnstar. Who knew all this could happen ? __label__4 Might i also add that enabling iPad features in an iPhone app target seems silly. Why don ' t you do it properly and make the iPhone app a universal binary (iPad+iPhone) ?__label__4 I ' ve always pondered if there were any 3D games classified as "Metroidvania". Do you know of any other than the Prime series (which I ' ve always considered in the spirit of the classification, but never really dwelled on it)?__label__4 I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Please be more precise ? __label__4 It is fair use. And, I have no free alternative in the context of "Sugoroku Mutou." Now, why don ' t you find me a replacement picture in the context of "Japanese names," and I will accept the removal of the picture ? __label__4 Hi, Jpa! Why not archive the old discussions on your talk page ? __label__4 @Georg : Anyway, I inended to answer both questions. Do you think I should edit my answer to make this clearer ?__label__4  " Checkpoints", hmm? Must they be visited in order ? __label__4 Sorry but I never saw any application breaking after deleting / moving .folders.. usualy they just reconfigure and restore to defaults. What exactly did break for you ? __label__4 What do you mean Justin? I am unsure what you mean by Autobot and Decepticon ? __label__4 Are you saying that Racepacket attempted to contact Laura ' s employer? When and where did this happen ? __label__4 I ' m sorry but how do I delete old keys? All the keys or just those two ? __label__4 Have you tried simply turning your muffins at some point in the baking process ? __label__4 The sum divided by 4 results in 6 minutes. How do you get 8 minutes ? __label__4 hi zaky, i m using xcode 4 tat rename button doesnt exist anymore.. hi vakio, yes i can see "SimpleScrollView" still in the pbxproj, wat do u mean by "rename the executable"?__label__4 What page is this? Why was it deleted ? __label__4 I think you *might* be slightly pushing the edge of gamedev, though I hope you find your answer. You may want to try the gaming stackexchange ? __label__4 What do you mean by "URL", exactly? This is a rather artificial concept with classpath resources - what would you do with that URL ? __label__4 I was wondering, why did you do that, create that new cat and then add it to the polanski without any discussion at all? Have you read the polanski talkpage and seen the lengthy discussion regarding the cats there ? __label__4 @MAK: Well, there is a problem **what order to store in**, and then there is a solution that specifies one way to solve the problem with its own advantages and disadvantages. Not `algorithm` -worthy ? __label__4 You are not talking about the **old** share button right? can you provide us the *other* blogs that have this special like plugin ? __label__4 Reading your help desk comment, I ' m totally confused now. Was it 2005 or 2006 ? __label__4 I ' ve yet to see a single keyword from the Fortran language in this question. Could you post a minimum size example of fortran code which gives this kind of error, along with what you did to generate it, instead of guessing on the source of the problems ? __label__4 By "this project" I mean Wikipedia. Do you share the values of civility and consensus ? __label__4 ..to Giggy ' s RfA. Did you mean to remove 2 , 066 bytes of replies ? __label__4 Please elaborate on "doesn ' t seem to be accurately answered". What did you try and what happened when you did ? __label__4 If the only page you ' ve been visiting is Wikipedia, then it makes sense the viruses would come from here, but if you ' ve been to other sites, they get thrown into the equation. Again, don ' t you have any anti - virus software ? __label__4 Track users? Keep statistics on what ? __label__4 No, I didn ' t know that. Where does this "rule" come from ? __label__4 @Chzz, the coverage in the references provided are a dedicted chapeter and a reproduced artice??__label__4 <url>: I am not sure how a regular spy mission gone bad had contributed to the history of cryptography. Should every spy ship, listening post, tampered cable and what not get included in the category ? __label__4 Are you actually wanting to know? Or are you telling me to include that information on the photographs page ? __label__4 How can people edit them if it just redirects? Did you think about that ? __label__4 Golf? Obfuscation ? __label__4 Sorry did not understand are you saying that Shotwell only works for Photo print sizes? If yes does this include the Custom option in the bottom of the list ? __label__4 Why not using `isnan()` from math . h? Any specially reason ? __label__4 Let me know what you ' d like me to do. Are you / anyone thinking of copying over the temporary copy wholesale or in parts; destroying the edit history of either, both or neither..?__label__4 Why doesnt belong there??__label__4 Yes, but the w doesn ' t have to be 2. What then ? __label__4 If you do it once, you can keep using it again, and again, and again.. In any case, "looks great" is really a subjective thing. Can you be more clear on what you actually want ? __label__4 sorry for the dumb question..one thing that I don ' t get is why /sites route and other routes in the documentation have **This method is new to version 1 . 1** description. Is it new or just updated ? __label__4 Could you ask a specific question? What have you tried so far ? __label__4 Technically, Taku is within his rights to change things to conform to an existing standard, but it ' s not very politic of him to do so; if we decide to change, then it ' s still more meaningless work to change everything once again. Unfortunately, it ' s all too common for editors to edit first and talk second, eh ? __label__4 @Matthew Why not just use an existing hashtable implementation? Why do you need a custom hash ? __label__4 And what, may I ask, is ''your'' relationship to Hammersoft? How did you come upon this matter ? __label__4 HTML5 is very diverse and can serve many different purposes. What is the main goal of your site ? __label__4 Please explain this <url>. Is there a valid reason why this image was removed ? __label__4 qsort does sort lines in increasing order, but your definition of "increasing" isn ' t the same as everybody else ' s. Why do you think it ' s more logical to sort strings by length rather than by alphabetical order ? __label__4 Subukan kong ipagtatanong - tanong ang pangalan ng lola mo sa mga kaibigan kong native dito. Sa Tuguegarao ba siya / sila mismo o sa ibang mga karatig - bayan ? __label__4 I have got a problem with your solution: the keys in your hashtable are not unique (if A[] = {1, 1, 1, 1} what is H ?). So how do you prove that H . get() is o ( 1) ?__label__4 Is this the exact question? If not can you please post it exactly, word for word ? __label__4 In case you didn ' t realize, one of the first things they states on that article was that if the information on a main or major character becomes long, then it warrants its own article. So, if that the case, then why did you merge <url>, since his article is long and he is the main character on <url>?__label__4  " Get Up" was released in Canada??__label__4 Variables should be extremely common, so why do you have to modify the most common with a $? Shouldn ' t something else get the $?__label__4 When you say "cover the chicken", specifically how and with what do you do that ? __label__4 Looks like you should have started your homework a bit earlier. What have you tried ? __label__4 Hmm.. this seems like a chemistry question to me (and therefore quite possibly off - topic for this site). Thoughts from anyone else ? __label__4 Arora and Barak ' s textbook on computational complexity covers derandomization fairly well. Did you have something else in mind ? __label__4 I notice that you added a period to the middle of a sentence in the article about <url>. Why ? __label__4 You recently uploaded <url> as being in the public domain as its copyright was not renewed. Does the book indicate that its copyright was not renewed or do you have any other reason to believe that the L . A. Times did not renew the copyright ? __label__4 Are you running a dedicated server with your own VMs, or do you have one VM provided by a hosting company? Or are you talking about vhosts in regard of apache being multi - homed ? __label__4 Complexity of what? Time complexity of some operation ? __label__4 Thank you very much @Lubos Motl ! Would you please sum up your comments and post them as an answer ? __label__4 One to go. Shouldn ' t "now welcome" be "not welcome"?__label__4 I ' ve never tried comparing them, but I ' d be very surprised if you saw a difference. Isn ' t the SQL engine going to optimize this for you ? __label__4 Note them where? On their talk page, or by adding them to the list you created at ArbCom so a clerk can notify them ? __label__4 That ' s exaxtly what i meant for the point one..and as you said 200 in 1 week is definetly more impressive than 100 in 1 year..Considering that i have a mysql db, php in the middle to make query and return json object and java for my android client that get the json and parse it . At wich level this "ordering" algorith should work? for example on the flight in php page..it mean that that the db is not ordered and in the php page i make a query enfding with ORDER BY and than my function ordering , or the MYsql db shoul already ordered , maybe running my algoruth once a day to reorder app table ? __label__4 Any more incite from either of you? Or anyone else for that matter ? __label__4 Well, for a start, why is this irreplaceable? He ' s still alive, so what ' s to stop someone taking a picture and releasing it under a free license ? __label__4 Serouj, you didn ' t reply to my message and my email. One question: if the church was built after 1700 but later ruin, for instance ruined by Beria order in 30s, can it be considered Contemporary ? __label__4 How ' s that even possible? Why don ' t you join the stdout to the logcat output and try to print that massive log directly on stdout ? __label__4 <url> apperantly we need a source..do you have one..??__label__4 I also have problems with a lot of the other recategorisation you have done to these articles, but I won ' t revert any more until I hear from you. Taking <url> as an example: why have you removed it from <url> when it clearly is a linear filter; why remove it from <url> when it forms part of image parameter theory; why does an article which discusses electronic designs not belong in <url>; why remove it from <url> when, obviously, it is a term ? __label__4 @Edward can you be more specific about what these three terms are supposed to refer to? Do you mean the machine running the software, the business that provides you the machine, or something else ? __label__4 This question is too vague. Please could you make it clearer exactly what it is you are asking ? __label__4 MONGO, today you speedied this article as a non notable character. Surely you know the non notable speedy criteria is for real people, not characters ? __label__4 in this case the noun has to be capitalised, so "Erdene Zuu monastery" would be "Erdene Zuu Monastery". And why did you move <url>, what other monastery with this name exists ? __label__4 Yeah, I ' m not sure that I care one way or another, but the 3RR is clearly incorrect. And what happened to <url>?__label__4 I am not sure what you are trying to achieve. Is it a non - convex hull that represents the shape of the point - cloud better than a convex one ? __label__4 You need to define your scope. Do you plan to use this on *many* words ? __label__4 .. since your ' re quoting something, mind sharing what you ' re quoting? A homework assignment perhaps ? __label__4 Alright, the NPOV template is even worse, since it specifically points people to a talk page discussion which does not exist. Why are you adding these templates ? __label__4 Alright, I don ' t like it but is not worth wasting more time on, but (as you now noticed as well) if it ''really'' had been deleted for <url>, it would have been truly problematic. Can I just ask: ''if'' Mephistophelian would return, are we allowed to undelete it ? __label__4 I don ' t understand what your question is. Where are you stuck ? __label__4 Well it looked as though it had stopped, certainly tapered off for a few days but now some bloody wanker has started adding it again. I don ' t suppose you know how to get a page protected, I ' ve never had to do it before ? __label__4 Sorry you ' re trying to make a stream of you on your computer? Screenshots or video from a webcam ? __label__4 you need a copy, you say.. by that you mean a translation, or one which has been reconstructed to meet en. wiki coding ? __label__4 To quote Scott Meyers: "`make`? Who needs stinkin `make`?".__label__4 What do you mean by "How to calculate"? Do you actually want to know the how the algorithmic complexity of stack operations is derived, or do you just want to know the answers ? __label__4 Please elaborate. Does it mean it ' s planned for Oneiric ? __label__4 I understand that *part* of the problem behind using cooking oil is that it goes bad and can smell faintly like, well, rotting food. Why does cooking oil do this and not chain lube ? __label__4 I was just about to create an article on the 2009 Malawian election; the purpose of adding it to the template was to give me a convenient link when I decided to do it. If red linked elections can ' t go in the template, why don ' t you delete all the red linked past elections ? __label__4 How much data are you backing up daily, weekly, monthly? How much data do you plan to retain, and for how long ? __label__4 color ( node) = if is _ even ( depth ( node)) then "black" else "red" .. is that really the question? Or is he asking whether an AVL tree can be colored such that it obeys all the properties of a red - black tree ? __label__4 I don ' t think I ' ll have the time to keep the flies off it all week but I ' ll have a go (I might get around to incorporating Caitlin Moran ' s detailed reviews too). Could you not semi it as well ? __label__4 He ' s aware of "perdoc", but he doesn ' t know how to search? And he ' s annoyed by it having MORE than just a list of functions ? __label__4 list b? I don ' t get it.. mind to explain more ? __label__4 Sorry, I didn ' t think about 20x hashed md5, so it isn ' t 36 ^ 32 but 19 * 36 ^ 32 + unknown lenght, characters, salt in last md5 hash. Am I right ? __label__4 Well, you ' re ignoring all caught exceptions. Is an exception being thrown ? __label__4 Your wiki or someone else ' s? What wiki software ? __label__4 How can you not know the length of the array? How will you know that your index is out - of - boundaries ? __label__4 i am not getting you, and where is the link ? __label__4 I kind of agree. Are you planning on actually editing Wikipedia, or is your whole purpose here to promote this .. study (or whatever it is)?__label__4 I ' m not sure I fully understand the problem. Are pick - an - email@domain addresses going to catchall@domain or does `pick - an - email` stand for one of the "real" addresses ? __label__4 What is `swappable` for? Why are there no comments in your code ? __label__4 Some clarification questions: 1) Do you want BibTeX to get the information _directly_ from the database, or are you prepared to extract it yourself in .bib format? 2) Do you already have the information in a database in a specific format and want to use only that, or would you be happy converting to another bibliographic database system ? __label__4 I need an answer to this question, but I cannot see which question it is meant to be a duplicate of. Where do I see that ? __label__4 @NV, if it ' s a job interview, are you allowed to get outside help? I mean, you ' re the one who ' s applying for the job, right ? __label__4 I dont understand "Toeing in Will" and by brake calipers, do you mean brake pads ? __label__4 I ' ve never worked with beamer `\note`. Could you please add a minimal example for your problem which compiles ? __label__4 What ' s not working? what do you expect it to do ? __label__4 Unicode contains only four double - struck Greek letters: ℽℼℾℿ (γπΓΠ), and since the Unicode repertoire is quite comprehensive (and much larger than the Comprehensive Symbols List), I ' d conjecture that this character is very uncommon. Could you give an example where this character is used ? __label__4 Hi, I noticed <url> of yours, claiming a <url> violation. Mind explaining that ? __label__4 Are you saying that you have a close or imtimate relationship with N . I.?__label__4 Your question is unclear. Do you mean extract the addresses from each incoming email and save them somewhere, or extract all the addresses you ' ve ever sent or received anything from ever ? __label__4 If the Russia tricolor is not the flag of the Lokot Autonomy, than what is? Is the flag even available on Wikipedia ? __label__4 You may be experiencing [bug #732677](https://bugs . launchpad . net / ubuntu/+source / bcmwl/+bug / 732677). Can you please edit your question to include the output of `sudo lshw -class network` and `lsmod | grep -E 'b43|ssb|wl'`?__label__4 I made the revert as an editor, not an Administrator - I haven ' t used my Admin tools and I have said I would not use them as I ' m involved. Where did I say I hadn ' t read any of the material ? __label__4 The bug you refer to is detected in 1 . 6 . 0 _ 4 and not yet fixed. Why wouldn ' t you expect it to be present in your environment ? __label__4 Btw, what ' s "WPC MOS", and where / when was it decided that we don ' t use volume indicators? Why is this, and how do we distinguish between different volumes of series when mentioning issue numbers ? __label__4 Why not keep the numbers in memory? Should be what, 100 MBytes ? __label__4 A hash? You mean a hash trie ? __label__4 There ' s a comment saying "special case to return to 2" associated with the following code `if count == 2 and pattern [ count] == 1`. What ' s so special about that case ? __label__4 How are recognizing and not recognising defined in this context? The country has explicitly and officially stated that they do or do not recognise the State of Palestine ? __label__4 can you please add the output from the `add - apt - repository` command ? Also after running `apt - get update` can you please run `sudo apt - cache policy nginx` and post the result ?__label__4 Have you actually installed one of these things on your website, and what experiences did you have with it ? __label__4 So, let me make sure I understand this. You think that, if we remove an image as it does not meet the NFCC, you would then be able to upload the same image, only this time, it would meet the NFCC ? __label__4 What do you mean "log in repeadedly? I just keep clickin' what button ? __label__4 I ' m using javascript to include other html files. <-- why ? __label__4 To be perfectly honest, I really have no idea what you ' re talking about. Would it not be simpler to just ''add'' a link to the template (if that is indeed what you mean) than to create a potentially offensive and almost certain to be rapidly deleted category ? __label__4 I tagged the most recent article. Aren ' t there guidelines for public history in your state ? __label__4 Re <url>: I reverted once. Shouldn ' t I get a cut of the proceeds ? __label__4 Yes, Pavel. That is correct (frame problem, much?) :(__label__4 I have noticed that you added the reference to him living in NZ. Do you know anymore ? __label__4 The article already says where they come from in the ''birth location'' field. What ' s the point of repeating it, especially at the expense of other info ? __label__4 Hmm. So **We ' ve a long way to go** in the UK, before we reach US linguistic standards? I know Americans favour inserting *got* there, but is that a closely - observed rule ? __label__4 Are you both "Dribblingscribe" and "Indiestu" ? Do both those accounts belong to the same person ? __label__4 The answers here (http://cooking . stackexchange . com / questions / 8618 / stopping - water - from - bubbling - over - when - cooking - rice) may be of help to you. For example, do you wash your rice before cooking ? __label__4 You never mentioned how far it is to work? How fast you ride ? __label__4 When I try to edit the article <url> I ' m refused to save my edit due to a "Blacklisted Hyperlink". What ' s wrong ? __label__4 You ' ve already said that you ' re using JPEG200, which will work. What do you have a question about ? __label__4 Links to attack sites and so are not allowed. You must know that you violated BLP ? __label__4 So your argument is that as long as you follow the "rules," nothing else should matter? That if it ' s legal it ' s OK ? __label__4 Sorry about not being clear, but I was talking about an idealised case where air resistance is negligible and the tires are perfectly rigid and there is no internal friction at play. So, then why is it 0 ? __label__4 I ' ve just seen your message on my Talk page. Why do you want the disambiguation page to be the one that doesn ' t say "disambiguation"?__label__4 I ' m don ' t understand what you are getting at here. It might help if you told us what `$one`, `$top _ level` and the output you want are, along with that "the value" means the value of what ? __label__4 I thought that only section tags go into sections while the article tags go to the top of the page so they could serve it ' s purpose. Is there a Wikipedia guideline that can substantiate your revert ? __label__4 Read beyond the obvious. What is that essay saying when you remove all referances to users under blocks, bans or other sanctions ? __label__4 Ack, hit the wrong button? How do you manage that ? __label__4 Hmm..it appears to be an infobox at the moment and lacking in any content other than that. Have you done a search for the battle at all ? __label__4 why o' why? Developing a new DBMS ? __label__4 Trust me, I have not. But when you create an app that is your own work from the ground up, don ' t you wanna dot the 'i ' s ? __label__4 Also, you ' re not really asking a question by just posting some unfinished code - you need to be more specific. Is there something you don ' t understand about how the code works ? __label__4 The consequences apparently have no sliding scale? It ' s either "you ' re blocked," or you ' re not ? __label__4 Charles River Media was acquired by Cenage at some point. I wonder if it ceased publication when that happened ? __label__4 All right, I ' ll bite. Is honorary membership in the Justice League not criteria enough for being listed in that category ? __label__4 Hey, what was with the fact tag? Do you dispute its name ? __label__4 Are you sure it ' s not a worn chain, or chain ring (or both)?__label__4 Then, I am curious. Why did you create the redirect in the first place ? __label__4 it just goes to update . php? nothing after ?__label__4 So why then does the lead stat in Christianity need a reference? Isn ' t it being contained in the article good enough ? __label__4 Was the stuck batter really brown? Did it stick on the sides ? __label__4 Yeah, funny I ' d write that while looking at the book.. Wasnt Mitch McConnell Pres. Bush ' s chief of staff ? __label__4 I never received any notification of any deletion proposal, lest I would have contested. Is there any way to find the original proposal and / or artical, or has it just been sent to oblivion ? __label__4 If she ' s been in a lot of porn movies, doesn ' t that show she is famous. Can ' t you undelete it and then let it go to a AfD discussion ? __label__4 This post says some things about "ownership" and "GIS" and "land" but there ' s no recognizable, unambiguous question. Could you please clarify and repost ? __label__4 @shodanex: The issue is likely to be specific to your particular hardware (or virtual machine), so you should describe it. Also, does the clock still drift if you turn “synchronize with internet” off ? __label__4 Please answer Bishonen question to you. When were you invited to comment on UC related subjects ? __label__4 maybe a bit harsh to close this. drop the last two sentences and it ' s an OK q, no ? __label__4 I was checking out the article on the Unitarian Society in Fall River that you contributed to, and there ' s a lot that was wrong. I want to reconcile what you know with what I know so we can get this article right.. a little help here ? __label__4 I would suggest you reconsider if using the `*` selector is a good idea. Maybe what you want to do is possible without iterating over the zillion elements that make up a production web page ? __label__4 The notion that a hunter would kill dozens of birds with a single shot seems outlandish to me. Do you have a reference for this ? __label__4 At the top of my talk page, it says, "If I left you a message: please answer on your talk page, as I am watching it." I think I already explained this to you. Is there a reason we cannot communicate ? __label__4 @Kosmonaut, I have to admit I ' d side with @Tony on this one, at least in the UK, *voila* would be used as a 'consciously' French word, whereas Envelope, brilliant wouldn ' t. [Almost worth another question?)__label__4 What exactly you need to do? Any examples??__label__4 Why do you need builtin DB support? Do you want to call the graph functions with SQL code as argument ? __label__4 Wassat? LeaveVissToYou ? __label__4 It ' s been four days. Still haven ' t tried the hotfix ? __label__4 He has requested unblock, states that he has edited from a school IP and that may be the reason for it. Who is he supposed to be a sock of, and what ' s the evidence ? __label__4 Why did you remove the pollution references on <url>. Do you have a source which refutes this claim ? __label__4 I ' m guessing ruby, but let ' s make it clear. What language ? __label__4 I Mean hes been really sucessful why not??__label__4 Just move <url> to <url>. And shouldn ' t the clean - up parameter be added to <url> also to make it work ? __label__4 @Jeff OK, OK. This is how wiki works though huh ? __label__4 You can place islands so there is no path between points. What should happen then ? __label__4 This is a very broad topic. Akin to, "How is cake made, and what are the ingredients?"__label__4 ??__label__4 I notice yall were trying to get some Canadian articles featured. How many Canadian articles are even at that status ? __label__4 What do you mean by "character"? The drive letter ? __label__4 All of the answers to that othe question are correct. Do you really need help updating a datbase or do you need help working with the Perl standard - data - structures ? __label__4 Code snippet? What is failing ? __label__4 There are quite a lot of <url> on Wikipedia. What ' s wrong with adding <url>?__label__4 Girne. Sen ? __label__4 Where is the vandalism? Diffs ? __label__4 Can I ask why you deleted this AfD as "A3: Article has no meaningful, substantive content"? It obviously did have meaningful content; was there any reason it couldn ' t simply be closed like any other AfD ? __label__4 Be more specific, what actually happens? Can you give a link ? __label__4 Can you please clarify your question so it ' s clear what you ' re asking for. Do you want examples of functional and non - functional requirements in the problem specification ? __label__4 Is there a reason you didn ' t accept the answer? Is there something wrong with it ? __label__4 Could you please be more specific. What do you mean by your desktop vanishing ? __label__4 Flying is fun! What more do you need ? __label__4 What was your aim with <url>? have you abandoned it ? __label__4 I note you reverted my edit on <url>, quoting "consensus". What consensus ? __label__4 Why not bake the stew in a traditional container and roast the pumpkin separately, then move the stew to the pumpkin? Or don ' t even roast the pumpkin ? __label__4 I asked it before but I ' m asking it again: Was it a Basque state? Can we say that ? __label__4 Owing to your status as an active wikipedian, I ' m not yet reverting your edit to this article. But what sense is it to move his birth location from the birthdate position in line one, to the top of (a newly formed) paragraph 2 which then (continues from the former paragraph 1 subject) takes off on a subject entirely unrelated to his birth ? __label__4 Are there integers? and can they repeat within a set ? __label__4 Terrible question title. I don ' t know enough about graphs to generate a better one - any suggestions ? __label__4 It ' s placed outside of the article body, not "randomly put in the code". Why such shuffling is a "proper CHECKWIKKI task" and why does it warrant saving an edit ? __label__4 Defined "central point"? Do you want any point within a convex hull around the points, the geometric center, or what ? __label__4 Why would you use a genetic algorithm for this? What ' s wrong with an ordinary one ? __label__4 you could have started the discussion yourself. How can you say there was no consensus against the edits if there had been no discussion at the time you were doing the reverting ? __label__4 As another aside, they are mostly Germans. What ' s up with that ? __label__4 Bureaucrats require a higher level of trust than administrators. Are you actually familiar with what these tasks entail ? __label__4 What is your source for the PD Seantors?

What is it that you are really trying to do ? __label__4 Preferably, we don ' t do peoples homework here at SO. But BTW - What ' s the </FORM>-tag doing in front of the javascript function ? __label__4 Not really, no (though maybe with JS).

Also, what does because I must there KeyPairValuOfStringAndCarType mean ? __label__4 Why revert? Shouldn ' t it be included somewhere in the discography ? __label__4 Emico, you have to understand that sometimes people use different words to describe the same thing. If I find a source saying "Hitler killed himself" and I write "Hitler committed suicide" am I wrong because the word ''suicide'' isn ' t in the sources ? __label__4 I think you may have made a typo in your question, you show Data #3 at index 4, then later show Data [ 4] = Data #4. But essentially you want to have an list with all 9 values, and fill in nulls where a value is not provided ? __label__4 I ' ve always been intrigued by 'dark - complected man.' What ' s with the radio, and fist in the air ? __label__4 I really would rather use, in English, the one expression "<url>" instead of "<url>," "marz," "<url>," "khaet," "<url>," "eparchia," "ostan," "khoueng," "faritany," "aimag," "tinh " u2014or "<url>" (aka "<url>"). <url> then why should "<url>" not be also ? __label__4 Funny, you could not tell it was me.. who else would it be??__label__4 Done.

This clearly disqualifies the text for Wikipedia purposes, I ' m afraid we ' ll have to delete the article. Do you know of any similar contributions you ' ve made ? __label__4 I ' m not sure what you ' re asking.. it is final; it is marked as such. Are you wanting to test that its value never changes during the execution of `method`?__label__4 <sigh> some people have no sense of humor. If I create <url>, do you suppose people will ignore it ? __label__4 Indeed.. The trolls just keep coming. Are you aware of content of the <url>?__label__4 Actually, that ' s again a misromanization.

Why can ' t you just store the "Range"?__label__4 I can, but it is written in Lithuanian language, so I think you woun ' t understand. Anyway, where should I put it ? __label__4 What I ' m trying to say is that I don ' t think this is really a valid question. You ' re basically asking "where should I store some files so I remember where they are?"__label__4 We? Which "we" would this be ? __label__4 I ' m wondering why you ' ve removed this category from <url>'s page? Is he no longer part of the council ? __label__4 I believe supserstition exists.

If I can hang on in here, can ' t you at least keep me company ? __label__4 I ' m not 100% clear on what you ' re asking, but I suspect there ' s one crucial idea that when you get, everything will fall into place. Are you aware that even "empty space" posses a vacuum energy due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and particle - antiparticle pairs can in fact be generated "out of nothing" for very short time periods ? __label__4 I know, I looked it up and fixed the article, but it was annoying that you just changed one small thing making the page contradict itself. What ' s the use changing it if the reader will have no idea what ' s going on ? __label__4 Your current solution may work but doesn ' t make sense to do it that way just so you can skip typing a class name.

What did you do to the technology gods to deserve this ? __label__4 I ' ve removed my remark. But if somebody puts words in another ' s mouth, and that second person states that is not what he meant, and the first person responds that no, that ''is'' what the second person meant, well, wouldn ' t you say that ' s a little weird ? __label__4 It makes a difference if they are sorted in ascending or descending order. Which is it ? __label__4 Is there an explicit reason you can not simulate data yourself (i . e. why you can not make your own gold standard and see how changing reference systems impacts this)?__label__4 Well, you leaved me also curious. Why was it not appropriate ? __label__4 Please do not remove warnings. Just follow the rules and everyone will get along, ok ? __label__4 What makes you think that this is the reason for the memory usage diff? Are your results repeatable ? __label__4 1. what are your pedals and why such pedals? 2.

But you find it normal that half the text after a particular character is lost though it does not contain special chars ?__label__4 Just try the first instruction - `MOVE *R2, R1` - read the comment next to it - it pretty much tells you all you need to know. What do you think the result of this instruction will be ?__label__4 If the ads are script elements, does it really matter where you place them? Perhaps you can give an example ? __label__4 According to ''Nature'' <url>, the picture is xa9 Zhongda Zhang / IVPP (IVPP is the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in China). What evidence do you have that we have permission to use it ? __label__4 What GUI framework? What OS ? __label__4 What is the question here? Are you wondering what you might ' ve missed ? __label__4 I just noticed you ' ve added me as a sock puppet for Blue Sea? Can I ask what led you to this conclusion ? __label__4 where are you viewing the records?? are you sure they are not stored well ? __label__4 Are you referring to loading them using the iPad Camera Connection Kit? If so, are you unable to delete the JPEG preview or the RAW image the JPEG was rendered from ? __label__4 Its not "really" fast, it just runs at a normal rate. Ever heard of the saying, in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king ? __label__4 Something ' s still not right with me here. Think you can perform one of those cleanups ? __label__4 @Smjg, thanks. But why did you also remove the categories I added ? __label__4 What dictionary do you normally use? Does it lack these definitions or are they confusing ? __label__4 I agreed from my very first post on the first subject that it shouldn ' t be included yet you and the other user continued to misrepresent my position. Would you disagree with that ? __label__4 Thanks, but why specifically? Because I know the difference between ''hale'' and ''hail''?__label__4 Hey, why do you edit the standings when a game isnxb4t over??__label__4 I see a number of possible apps when I search in the Market for "mp3 tag". Did you try that ? __label__4 There are not many ready - made exploits for max excel out there, at least not in non - commercial exploit packs. Which version of office do you have ? __label__4 I really had intended ot get back to this, and to get out to see it. How about: ..that <url> was built from plans found in the <url>'s pocket when he died of a heart attack ? __label__4 Are you 100% sure that the planks in your hardware store never got treated with chemicals ? __label__4 I deliberately didn ' t mention memory constraints because I wanted to hear several ideas and then make a judgement about speed / memory tradeoff. Can you be more specific about lookup tables in this scenario ? __label__4 Why did you just blank your userpage? It ' s not Wikisuicide, is it ? __label__4 Still, I cannot understand why virtually all boxes related to the EU were removed. What makes this issue more divisive than for example the re - unification of Yugoslavia ? __label__4 I removed most of the boldface lettering from the article. And what do you mean by "the referencing is insuficcient"?__label__4 You also did three reversions. Where are the administrators, meanwhile ? __label__4 I have one last question about the SPI I filed et al. before I put this ugly chapter of my time here behind me; should the <url> sock not be tagged with <code><nowiki><person></nowiki></code>?__label__4 That was awfully quick, considering that it was open for less than 12 hours. Since I must now do them individually, must they be considered "Second Nominations" if I put them up again ? __label__4 It ' s a low - profile page in the sense of not getting much attention from editors. Why do you think addressing Luther ' s views on grace is necessary to understand contemporary philosophy ? __label__4 How exactly is it unclear? The ships link to the same place, the prefix "HMS" comes before ''Eagle'' to show her name change.. what ' s not there that should be ? __label__4 Ok, so if you can ' t fond the correct tires for your car, you ' ll prefer to re - invent the wheel? Won ' t you change your tire - dealer ? __label__4 You said ''"undo. Raggz, you added the tag and THEN mentioned it on talk- you did not gain consensus first or even wait for anyone to discuss it."'' Is consensus required to add a tag ? __label__4 That ' s what I like in the interview questions: the question is theoretically interesting but I would be hard pressed to find a usecase within a minute. Seriously, who manages linked list explicitly ?__label__4 What ' s the benefit of the horizontal dropout? Is it safety? Is it just a style? Is it ease of maintenance ? __label__4 Your new images of Micheal Knight and Devon look kinda squashed. Can you fix them or find better ones to replace them ? __label__4 I have some made some improvements to the articles you references on the above user ' s talk page. Perhaps next time you would bring your concerns directly to ''me''?__label__4 Do you mind if you tell me why do you add duplicate links to the article? More specifically, why do you add internal links to the See Also sections when those links are already in the article navbox ? __label__4 Seems to be down again. I assume this is nothing I can resurrect on my own when you have intermittent Internet access like this ? __label__4 How hot was your oven? did you glaze the pastry prior to baking ? __label__4 The only time that I saw that was when using different monitors, or a remote login (in other words : changing the resolution, and then the layout of the panels). Is it your case ?__label__4 your answer is too broad - can you try to give a little focus as where the question points? what aspect is relevant ? __label__4 I ' m loathe to come running to an admin, but Gregcaletta is just making the same edits that I had undone before and made objection to on the talk page without any attempt to address the previous objections on the talk page. Now what ? __label__4 Who said the bunks are equidistant? Also, what is a "bunk"?__label__4  " with just an index" to what? is this homework ? __label__4 Sorry Less? What is that last postdirected at ? __label__4 There is no need to swallow initial whitespaces of lines; they are ignored anyway. Can you please edit your answer accordingly ? __label__4 I ' ve updated the plugin a few times on numerous blogs and never had to re - enter the API Key. Do you have a similar issue with the Askimet plugin ? __label__4 What do you mean by "will take an arbitrary number"? Do you think about some input (from user or file) or some other way ? __label__4 How did you learn Interlingua? Was it an online course like lernu, or what ? __label__4 Why are you doing `{% ifequal gallery . draft True %}`? Why not do `{% if gallery . draft %}`?__label__4 While browsing wikipedia for missing pages to write i saw it on your things to do list. Assuming he ' s a poet, do you mean <url>?__label__4 Accepted! @Rory, one more thing - can you add a line about using the *right* hashing algorithms ? __label__4  - 1: Huh?? Can you please explain ? __label__4 Which link are you referencing? Anyway, TTN, that another phony or is that you on WikiQuote ? __label__4  ( S ) he seems to have violated the spirit of 3RR <url>. How do we deal with this guy ? __label__4 OK, so while browsing my watchlist, I saw something peculiar in one of the pages that I ' m watching; the user seems to be quite suspicious, based on his user page (similar to Wynchard Bloom ' s) which leads to the conclusion that he ' s Gerald. Can you like give him the stick ? __label__4 So far there are four editors on <url> who have called you on your edit - warring. Would you please stop ? __label__4 I see you ' ve added <url> to the category "Jewish - Canadians". What is your source for this ? __label__4 Andy, that jars with my understanding of what a Sylvester matrix is. Do you have a reference ? __label__4 Nothing jumps out. You *did* restart VS after copying the visualizer, right ? __label__4 I was about to participate in the Afd on Wooster Greeks. You ' ve reverted yourself and re - closed it ? __label__4 By downvoting without any comment is not helping anyone. Don ' t you think that some kind of explanation would be nice for Ved ? __label__4 I think one reason people think it ' s a lame question is that the OP didn ' t posit even one reason developing such a game would seem to be easy. Kind of like asking "Why is it so hard to fly like superman?"__label__4 Ditto? whats the deal ? __label__4 Just wondering why removed death material? Perhaps another article on his death and circumstances- legacy ? __label__4 my edit was described as ''(Reverted 1 edit by 64 . 53 . 137 . 232 (talk): Rv. (TW))'' and I didn ' t give the guy a warning or anything so how would anyone think I was calling him a vandal ? __label__4 @Frog: Your question is only slightly clearer now. Is the general rule "xyz" -> "myXyz"?__label__4 I would suggest you change the title to something less subjective, such as "What is a good package for displaying algorithms?" or more in line with the current one "What is a good package for displaying dem algorithms?" :)__label__4 @Yoga, did you get around to reading the FAQ ? And why is advice for a better question bullying ? __label__4 I ' m not sure what you mean? Add my interests ? __label__4 Why did you remove you comment on the talk page? Did you change your opinion ? __label__4  " best" according to what Goal? What are you trying to minimize or maximize ? __label__4 And what about <person>? Does it need fixed now too ? __label__4 One of your edits concerns me - <url>. Maybe a copyedit would be good, but was it really required to be deleted completely ? __label__4 I will take out Haskett in deference to you. OK ? __label__4 ..just vandalized my page again. What level warning is appropriate ? __label__4 Concerning <url>, I must say I am a bit confused: isn ' t the article ' s title "Austria<span style="color : red">u2013</span>Hungary" (where, incidentally, it was moved after an "Austria<span style="color : red">-</span>Hungary" period)? It ' s really no big deal, but how can something be both correct and incorrect, and which standard are we at long last supposed to follow ? __label__4 I ' m with you - it really is a friggin' pain that people refuse to read no matter how big you put the text. Should we just maybe remove the source entirely ? __label__4 @Dan Dinu: is it guaranteed it is possible to identify who is a liar and who is a truthteller? should we be able to identify it is not possible ? __label__4 I am far from worked up over this, but find it hard to AGF when someone tries to include inaccurate information into an article, claiming it had been checked by an administrator. Who was the administrator ? __label__4 Not a trivial task for homework. Did you not get any advice from the teacher on how to proceed ? __label__4 Hm. Am I imagining things, or does <url> seem familiar ? __label__4 "*i need to include that function*" What function? "*i need to know an easy way to get it included and get started with it*" What is 'it'?__label__4 Making edits vanish without a trace would be ''extremely'' difficult to do u2013 only full <url> could do that, and I can assure you the oversighters wouldn ' t do such a thing just to allow somebody to cover their tracks. Maybe you are mis - remembering something, about edits that were in fact on some other page ? __label__4 Um.. the Kent roast? Tentrake host ? __label__4 Debug adds lots of overhead to a program. Why are you assuming things are wrong ? __label__4 Please don ' t mention other languages when we ' re discussing the English wikipedia! Why are you limiting yourself only to the Abrahamic concepts of ''God''?__label__4 Not writing a full blown DNS so reading never ending RFC is a bit boring. Or is that absolutely essential ? __label__4 Title says it all.<url> I dont have time to put up a page.. but might I suggest <url>?__label__4 Again: What attributes do you have? What is the structure of your data ? __label__4 sorry, there aren ' t enough details for me to even begin answering. Could you include some more information ? __label__4 Nope. Do I need to start one ? __label__4 Its been over a week now and I see you still haven ' t passed or failed the article. Made a decision ? __label__4 If it ' s read - only .. what exactly are you testing? I presume (because it ' s read - only) that the data is input from somewhere else and Rails is just consuming it ? __label__4 ..cause I feel like a petulant kid, posting it. But: "We have three volunteers: Awadewit, Mike Christie and Wrad." Given that I, you know, proposed the countries idea, wasn ' t it obvious that I was volunteering ? __label__4 This has got nothing to do with any of the tags. Please can you retag appropriately if you want an answer ? __label__4 return cell; [tableView deselectRowAtIndexPath : indexPath animated : YES]; why you have code for deselecting row after returning cell??__label__4 Extended Attributes will allow you to set some very liberal access permissions, and tell them to propagate inside the directory, and continue to do so on new creations, but for the life of me I can ' t find instructions. I can only do it on OSX Servers using the Server Admin Tools, which I assume is not a viable option here ? __label__4 no.. there is no viewForSection method. What images are you referring to ? __label__4 Perhaps these articles should be nominated for deletion. A blue belt is far from a notable BJJ player; Google returns 594 results for him, many of which might not even be the Barry Ley in question; and as for the Blaggers article: I don ' t see any articles on the higher - selling books you mention, why does this one deserve it ? __label__4 Because different different languages have different strengths and libraries already written for them. If I wanted to write lots of set up code for this problem, why would I pick a dynamic language, why not give myself more work and code in Java or C ? __label__4 Yes, I appreciate that my edits were not the best, but they are currently the best available in Wikipedia for guiding readers in understanding there the emergence of the legal systems of the United Kingdom. Do You have a better suggestion ? __label__4 In this <url> there was a loss of some info. Was that intentional ? __label__4 What ordering are you assuming for @array2. In other words, why does the count for 'one' come before the count for 'two'?__label__4 I hope Ed ' s doesn ' t look like mine. Wait--what is this navbar we ' re talking about ? __label__4 What ' s wrong with Quickbooks Online? Is there something specific you ' re looking for that they don ' t offer ? __label__4 well it wasn ' t exactly a joke. am I the only one who notice they share the same melody ? __label__4 The Field API is a very large section of the Drupal API. What, specifically, are you trying to accomplish ? __label__4 I am bewildered as to why anyone should think that they are "representatives of the people". They are not elected, chosen, delegated, or in any other way appointed by the people: how are they representatives of the people ? __label__4 Do you need the id column? Why not just tell the query to fetch only the name column ? __label__4 What exactly want you to install the mysql server? Can you give the commands you entered + the output ? __label__4 a bit late I know but I just saw this question. Shouldn ' t it be on http://ww . superuser . com ?__label__4 One question - how come the page is marked as "in dispute"? The data that is currently posted isn ' t in dispute, correct ? __label__4 So how are u gonna concider weither the licences used by Fluckr are accurate..? ,and if this image has to bee conciderd than http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Image : Petercrouch _ liverpool . JPG should be to..?__label__4 Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known ? __label__4 I see you moved and renamed.. um, it.. to <url>. Are you sure about that, given the conventions at <url>?__label__4 What does this have to do with programming? Are you trying to solve this problem with a program ? __label__4 task == homework? ^^ Moreover: what is supposed to output this newly invented `diff`?__label__4 I don ' t understand this. There is an infinite number of possible strings between "a longer string" and "another long string", so how can you guarantee unique values ? __label__4 I see you removed the review, which makes sense until at least four days from now, when it won ' t be mentioned on the mainpage at all. But maybe leave a note at <url> so he doesn ' t feel put - off ? __label__4 Are you saying that it ' s impossible for Wikipedia to admit that most people don ' t know the true meaning of slavery? That it ' s my point of view & original research in understanding what the true meaning of slavery is ? __label__4 Please define "primary navigation". Also: are you using a custom theme, or one from the theme repository ? __label__4 Hi, ixb4d like to know why are you constantly removing all information i put in your scm comparison about Plastic SCM. donxb4t we have the right to show there our information as the rest of users ? __label__4 Gee, thanks. But shouldn ' t it be a barnstar for ''bad'' humor, or maybe for the humor "phlegm"?__label__4 Perhaps this is best seen as a way to structure the design of a large - scale digital circuit (just like it might be a good idea to use subroutines in a large - scale computer program), and not really as a formal lower bound? (Chapter 14 of the book that you linked has plenty of Theorems with Proofs, but they seem to assume that you follow certain principles in the design of the circuit?)__label__4 But, before you accuse me of shying away from your second to last question, my PhD is in inorganic chemistry, homogeneous catalysis to be specific, but my latest scientific paper was submitted (still with the reviewers) to ''<url>'': it touches on the metrological consequences of the microscopic quantization of ''Q'', as it happens, although that is not its main thrust. So, do you want to thrash this out among scientists, or would you prefer to waste your time with ArbCom ? __label__4 Without seeing the images, how can we help you? Can you post some links to them ? __label__4 Yeah, at the moment. Unless there are any other dryandras on the cusp of GA - hood..?__label__4 <url>. Or is it just me ? __label__4 Do you really want to parse both in the same context? What about things like "2 , 00 , 00 . 45"?__label__4 ??__label__4 Sorry, but i do not find "double torpedo tunnels" to be very good. Can you come up with something better ? __label__4 Hi, Why were the images <url> from the infobox in <url>? Is this part of an MOS or something ? __label__4 Actually it was a compliment. Does that count as an 'issue'?__label__4 I ' m confused: what did you do? And how did you delete it twice without restoring it in between ? __label__4 I eat rarely. Is that bad ? __label__4 What are you trying to get exactly? If the list is just 2 tickets with priorities 3 and 5, what do you want to find ? __label__4 Having the number of managed threads isn ' t very meaningful as a metric; most of those threads will have near - zero overhead when they ' re sleeping. Why do you want to know ? __label__4 I ' m sorry, but I can ' t understand `find the missing element in O ( N) or better` What does mean *"or better"* in this context? It seems the kind of thing that would be solved with a simple while loop, but anyway I don ' t understand - it ' s either *solved* or *not solved*, right ? __label__4 Crossover with ''30 Days of Night''?! wow..link ? __label__4 I don ' t see anything there that would indicate that you can use dynamic text to label latitude and longitude. Can you please provide some more information or a methodology ? __label__4 Indian cultural imperialism is rampant this am - what nxt? we have had the mongolians and indians - maybe the astragoths next ? __label__4 *"I ' m developing a Java desktop application that is to be used with Ubuntu."* What is the attraction of coding in Java when only targeting one OS ? __label__4 Looks like you ' ve been a bit inactive lately, but on the off - chance you check in soon, take a look at <url> and <url>. You ' re probably the most familiar with CoM ' s style and brand of hostility, do you think Freakshownerd here is his sock ? __label__4 How do you know the i386 machine is i386 only? Also, why not a universal build ? __label__4 I obviously made a mistake too. Do you really think I ' d purposefully misinterpret things like that ? __label__4 So who exactly is going to *teach* this topic in the class? Shouldn ' t the teacher be able to "show how it can be implemented"?__label__4 by js?? you mean AJAX??__label__4 Why is your `i` loop going from `j : 6`, rather than `1 : 6`? Have you noticed that `sum` is being recalculated on every iteration (overwriting the value from the previous iteration)?__label__4 Could you clarify what you mean by "go into"? Why don ' t you explain what you want to happen ? __label__4 Ultimately, **every** file is represented using `0` and `1` only. What makes a "bitmap index" different ? __label__4 You might want to explain a bit more of the *removing* business. Why is the first `remove` removing `2` (tail of the sequence), but the second removing `3` (which at the time is the head of the sequence)?__label__4 Changed tag to "copyright". Was there a specific tag you were looking to use ? __label__4 Thats good. Do you have any enemies on here as well ? __label__4 You ' re probably trying to optimize the wrong thing. I ' m wondering why you think this particular part of the language is so important ? __label__4 How is "17 : 18 : 3600" supposed to be understood? Is this a standard format ? __label__4 SPI is not for just simple yes no answers. Why did you not warn the Minneapolis IP, they are warring as much as Bb23 ? __label__4 Avinash: Below, you rejected Levenshtein as "slow". So your idea of "best" must include performance, too, no ? __label__4 It was for closure ' s sake, as to show that the debate was closed and that was the result, the user was ''blocked'' and the userpage was ''deleted''. Doesn ' t that show you the items better ? __label__4 Have you tried upgrading using the tools provided with core? What errors have you encountered ? __label__4 There ' s nothing in your history besides editing my page, so I ' m not sure to what you are referring. What page are you talking about ? __label__4 Hey, look at this, I don ' t even know your name! Quel est votre nom, Mademoiselle ? __label__4 what error did you get (exception / error message) ? what exactly do you want to achieve when you say "merging" 2 PNG ?__label__4 Drat forgot to sign. You blanked my talk page and asked if I don ' t like K ' s ? __label__4 Helped them do what? Leave Israel ? __label__4 As the log mentions, BTServer is posting a notification called BluetoothAvailabilityChangedNotification. Why don ' t you suscribe to this, and any other notification interesting to your app instead of reading and parsing the logs ? __label__4 This is just the "name hiding" issue. Why can ' t you just use the `using A::foo` clause ?__label__4 I ' d suggest you get an iPod Touch to develop on then. Don ' t tell me you need something iPhone specific for your application like GPS? :)__label__4 Picking up your challenge. You a big fan of skittles or something ? __label__4 <url> suddenly has a bunch of new entries for today. Did you change the program ? __label__4 Why would one want to re - create GNAA??__label__4 Double standards? Biased administrators ? __label__4 I don ' t get it. How can you want to find the "highest value" while at the same time not caring how a comparison is done ? __label__4 Have you tried? How? Some code ? __label__4 How do you expect a DOM node to be serialized? What information do you want from a DOM node ? __label__4  " Use images for transactions"?? Do you mean that you want to use images to represent certain info on the screen ? __label__4 So what exactly is the problem? Changing the size doesn ' t work ? __label__4 sound weird to me, why do you need to unmount? what ' s wrong with just shutdown ? __label__4 I gotta ask..why would you replace your speaker wire once a year ? __label__4 Yes, I posted a link to the history. I was asking / thinking where you stepped into the discussion and if you were editing as an IP and that would put a different slant on your 3rr warning to Bbb23?, have you been recently editing the article was the simple question ? __label__4 Gah! What just happned ? __label__4 I hope I am now signed on and you remove the erroneous vandalism report. Don ' t you think it would be more politic to send a message with a question than to preemptorily declare an edit "vandalism"?__label__4 I couldn ' t tell you why glam rock was there. Better ? __label__4 you recently deleted <url>. can you tell me where is the AfD debate on that article ? __label__4 There is a lot to learn - but to date I have concentrated on content, followed by style. If I have to keep removing silly comments, though, I will get discouraged - is there an easy way to reverse somebody ' s goofing ? __label__4 At the top of the page it characterizes a guideline as ''a generally accepted standard that editors should follow'' along with a passing reference to <url>. So, I might ask, how would using 4 tildes prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia ? __label__4 Okay, I have built a radar system before, I need one major thing, that I am not sure if you intended to answer. Do you plan to do this at a single frequency ? __label__4 Eh. Awesome as in you are going to be more active ? __label__4 Yes, I know what a score ''card'' is, but you wrote "score ''car''" in the article. Was that a typo, or is there really such a thing as a score "car"?__label__4 @Dallaylaen _$ =~ s/::/<br />/g; Like that??__label__4 I don ' t repro this at all. What *exactly* do you type ? __label__4 please can you confirm where you have downloaded moonlight - and which version (add this to your question). Also, which websites are not working (add the links)?__label__4 Unclear. Is that one process ? __label__4 You may not remember doing this but, you erased a page entitled, Earl Newton. Why did you do it ? __label__4 Yeah, why do you have multiple HTML files in one file in the first place? Wouldn ' t it be easier to remedy that ? __label__4 arg, sorry. I was fiddling around with item formatting all day long I started to believe you can ' t use formatting in item[] at all.. Should I delete the question ? __label__4 What ' s wrong with the standard NBA style for the userbox template? Why can ' t the Thunder ' s box look LIKE EVERY OTHER TEAM ' S ? __label__4 What do you mean *excluding the $ and $*? What $ and $?__label__4 @BoltClock: I ' m pretty sure that algorithms are part of the "programming" subject. Strictly speaking an algorithm is not a program, of course, but are we really going to throw out all the questions on searching and sorting methods, on the grounds that "quicksort is an algorithm, it has absolutely nothing to do with programming"?__label__4 How are you grilling them? High heat? Low and Slow? How long does it take to cook them on the grill ? __label__4 He ' s still got the youtube link on there even after your reversion. How does once vs. 25 times or so make any difference ? __label__4 Why did you rollback <url>? It appears by a quick scan that the user was correct re <url> - but regardless seemed a good faith edit, one certainly not worthy of a vandalism rollback I would think ? __label__4 What do you mean by *"the compiler thinks it ' s an integer"*. How can the compiler think a 30 - digit number is an `Integer`?__label__4 Looks like you ' re passing null to an API parameter, particularly a null Overlay somewhere in a mapview probably. How are we supposed to know ? __label__4 Thanks; I expected a decline, despite my extensive comments at <url>. As there is nothing more to this article than listings of bylines in non - notable publications, minor book acknowledgments, uncredited movie extra roles, blog comments, paid directory listings, and unsubstantiated claims about wildly over - the - top PR accomplishments, what exactly do you consider to be the examples of "credible notability"?__label__4 Please enlighten me. How can a developer make doubly sure that his / her fix is correct if he / she can ' t reproduce the bug ? __label__4 There ' s no tab at the top of the page with a bold EDIT THIS PAGE on it. Is it just my computer ? __label__4 Figures as much. What ' s wrong with it ? __label__4 BTW, small step, huh, from Berkely to Soman ' s talk page. What ' s next--Cambridge ? __label__4 Actually, it IS quote - mining when you provide a quote from an author that is the exact opposite of the primary meaning and intention of the author. Let me ask you, then, what was the primary message of the Linde letter to the editor ? __label__4 You support Scotland leaving the United Kingdom despite the fact most Scots do not? I am curious as to why ? __label__4 You ' re right, but loosing it because of Devanampriya, of all users, would be quite a shame for Wikipedia. Don ' t we have to make a stand against ignorance, partisan POV - pushing and constant incivility ? __label__4 I don ' t think there ' s any "optimal" way to do it other than just scanning the string looking for the delimiters. Perhaps _you_ could code that yourself ? __label__4 Do you have problem with it? Does it work ? __label__4 The water . mapcalc file should be rather straightforward. However, probably the white space in the directory name causes troubles ? __label__4 Polynomial of what? Number of points defining the space ? __label__4 Is this format safe? Does it remove also hidden partitions, if any ? __label__4 Right, so the links on your userpage? And what is the "article" you want me to check over ? __label__4 Regarding <url>: <url> seems to say the exact opposite (that links on a dab page should ''not'' be through redirects). The page is at <url>, so shouldn ' t that be how it ' s linked on the dab page ? __label__4 Not sure I understand the question: (1) wireshark will look at packets as they come from the wire, so iptables rules for incoming packets do not apply; (2) your iptables rules apply to UDP, but you state that you open a raw socket. Could you please clarify what you are trying to achieve and what does not work as expected ? __label__4 Got another one: <person>. Can ' t someone with CheckUser abilities block the IP address ? __label__4 You removed posts by me as well. Do you have any explanation ? __label__4 experence suggests that most of the time it is an extreamly good criteria but in this case I ' ve put the links back. Which morris side are you with ? __label__4 What for did you analyse the two ArbCom cases Piotrus - Ghirla and Eastern European dispute? Was that suggested to you by Sciurinxe6 during your off - wiki discussions for 20 days ? __label__4 hmm. off topic ? __label__4 Thank you! I am confused about the save function though.. can you please explain how is works ? __label__4 @ANdrea: I don ' t that is right. What if all the numbers were negative ? __label__4 And what is the problem? Other than the missing semicolon after name [ 25]?__label__4 Well, what do your current results look like? Is the glow you ' re talking about from the high brightness images having spillover (ie, pixels that would be black or dim in faster exposures are accumulating more light from nearby light sources in the slower ones, throwing off the HDR processing?)__label__4 @Aaronut Can ' t someone do this besides the OP? Don ' t we have some sort of mod people ? __label__4 That "guest" could have been an undercover Colbert staff member and the whole segment could have been staged. Otherwise, why would Colbert have taken 3 minutes out of his show to talk to someone in the audience ? __label__4 AFAIK you ' ll need to loosen your spokes to get one in there. So maybe it shows you have a spoke wrench ? __label__4 Why can ' t it just be fixed? There are other tables on wikipedia that aren ' t working properly, perhaps nobody noticed ? __label__4 This does not look like Python.. what exactly do you want? parse C++ code with a Python program ? __label__4 You recently edited this page. It is my view that this page is just a corporate marketing listing, there are several hundred companies that do the same job yet are not listed in Wikipedia - Do you not think that this is advertorial ? __label__4 I would go and say, "I can ' t find any problem. Are you sure it ' s not the user?"__label__4 Wait, I ' m confused. Aren ' t you already a moderator ? __label__4 Either <url> is really misinterpreting the guidelines or I missed out on something. Care to shed light here ? __label__4 Doubt it. Why do you have PHP source stored in a MySQL database ? __label__4 Any particular reason you ' re thinking of `O ( n * log ( log ( n))`? Or is that just something that spontaneously came into your head ? __label__4 Why do you think there should be a klass method on the class you are using? What are you trying to achieve ? __label__4 I see you have been creating lots of articles on bus stations on the <url>. Considering how little information there is (and is likely to be) for these stations, would it not be better to have them all on one article ? __label__4 Storing an entire HTML page as CSV doesn ' t really make much sense. You mean convert an HTML table to CSV ? __label__4 Isn ' t this section "Vatican Responses"? How come the wordings are not fact - based but seem to have devolved into media perceptions of the Vatican responses ? __label__4 A redirect works exactly the same way regardless of whether there ' s a space between "#REDIRECT" and the target article ' s name or not. Why bother removing spaces from the redirects if it doesn ' t change the functionality at all ? __label__4 What do you mean by prefix? Do you mean to add a prefix to all the entity class names ? __label__4 What do you mean by "There ' s no Interlocked function available that will actually swap values."? Why can ' t you use these functions ? __label__4 That code works fine for me. What does your **actual** code look like ? __label__4 He ' s taken the notice down. Doesn ' t this count as belaboring the point ? __label__4 When I look at your grammar at line 264, you define the syntax for an object.. but you don ' t appear to create a tree for object subexpression. What do expect the primary _ expression rule to do when it encounters an object and tries to set $$ to what I am guess ing is <junk>?__label__4 I ' m confused. Why did I get a user warning relating to this article ? __label__4 @edA - qa mort - ora - y: Why instead of saying *I want it POD* do you not state what is it that you need? Why is it that you are so interested in having it be a POD ? __label__4 On the third reading.. Why not include an edit summary that tells me this? Why not revert my revert ? __label__4 Well, now you ' ve got me puzzled. If you think he ' s a sneaky vandal, why did you revert my reversion of his numerical change ? __label__4 Please stop removing properly referenced information that I have added to this article. This is an article that <b>YOU</b> nominated for deletion, so why are you even editing it ? __label__4 Who does not want to see such questions might want to include poll and subjective into the ignored tags. ;-) What is the point of it being a wiki ? __label__4 Do you understand how `UIImagePickerController` works? Do you have the delegate methods implemented ? __label__4 Could you please block me indefinitely. If you can ' t then what do I need to do to get blocked indefinitely ? __label__4 Anyone know if this just for the galaxy s? I don ' t think I ' ve ever seen this in stock Android or cyanogenmod ? __label__4 What "did not work"? closing of the connection or removing the persistence ? __label__4 Maybe you can add the way you (or your (grand ) mother) prepare it ? __label__4 Use a thick pen for the line and thin one to draw the border. (BTW, What ' s that got to do with `C++`?)__label__4 I read his note, and you should know that as I responded to it and then you responded to me. So where did the doubt come in regarding that matter ? __label__4 I have no clue. Isn ' t there a WikiProject on radio stations you can ask ? __label__4 You added the name Ken Taylor to the <url> page but there is no such person listed on the DOD website as having received that award. Who were you refering to ? __label__4 What are you programming on, where 16MB is too much? A phone ? __label__4 You parsed XML using JSON parsing? Why??__label__4 And I guess with exception of 7 countries that recognize same - sex marriage, everybody else would end up in "homophobia" category. Or what would be the threshold ? __label__4 I think we must sort the group for select algorithm but it is not necessary for sorting the elements in the quick select algorithm !! isn ' t it ? __label__4 Exactly how is your bignum stored? Or if you don ' t know that, how are you allowed to access it ? __label__4 You seem to have missed the whole point of templates, there. Why create the text manually using concatentation and then "rendering" something that contains no template syntax, rather than actually using a template file with proper template logic that can do all that for you ? __label__4 I ' m pretty sure that the google image search just goes by image name doesn ' t it? or are you talking about some other google search that I ' m unaware of ? __label__4 I think you ' ve got a typo here, I doubt that command returned "How do I find out which process is eating up my bandwidth?".. ;) any chance you could edit the question please ? __label__4 and so is the new Portishead. Did I mention the Knife ? __label__4 Sorry to be daft, but where do I find the community wiki? Is that another name for the Metas site or is it something completely different ? __label__4 Are you saying that Scotty was being "hot - headed"? If so, can you please tell us what Scotty did that was "hot - headed"?__label__4 you should probably explain the acronyms. Is RMQ range - minimum and RSQ range - sum ?__label__4 Hi reinyday - I ' ve been noticing your sig on WP : CFD.. this is probably something you know all about but.. you do know about being able to use four tildes (<nowiki>~~</nowiki>) to sign, don ' t you? Or have you done some fancy trick with your signature to stop it linking back to your user page ? __label__4 Nice close shot, but almost too minimalist.. Now I and James Barrie can ' t agree if this is the inside or the outside of the wok. Can you throw some light on the matter ? __label__4 Less than 127? Don ' t you mean "Less or equal to 127"?__label__4 Your recent edits with Dab solver seem to be removing rather a lot of links, without mentioning this in the edit summary. Is this intended behaviour ? __label__4 Granted, it wouldn ' t be terribly difficult for me to recreate what I did, but I don ' t like doing extra work when I don ' t have to. Could you at least userfy the last version edited by me ? __label__4 comment from a member of the Article Rescue Squadron? Do you know how to hide a human body ? __label__4 Unless im making a major mistake here, this article was about a Not for profit organisation which seemed notable enough to give the origional creator at least some time to source it. Are you sure this had to be a speedy ? __label__4 you have not provider the 11 , 21 , 31 code for that line. Can you provide dxf file so I can get a better look at it ? __label__4 But ATT is a re - statement of NOR and V. We don ' t need a re - statement of them and then call it RS. What would be the point ? __label__4 Reading the guideline again: ''The name of each article (a link to the articles is recommended as well) in which fair use is claimed for the item''. Where does that say I ''need'' a link to the article ? __label__4 Why do you want to use those? What are you trying to do ? __label__4 Email from the Darkshado guy complaining about you adding him to the spamlist. I searched the site and couldn ' t find any of our articles replicated there; has he removed them, or what ? __label__4 The race was advertised and billed as the 100th Indy 500. Are you saying the promoters and Indycar are liars ? __label__4 Also, u201ccould be expectedu201d? By whom ? __label__4 @Matt No it ' s not, because hashes are not encryption. Better would be "Can I find the preimage for a hash?"__label__4 PS do you really think that attrition is a degeneration? Surely it ' s the norm ? __label__4 Did you solve the other problem? The multiplication one ? __label__4 I tried this for some of the code but immediately ran into problems - the code for some reason it went over the book ' s margins. Please take a look here: http://i . imgur . com / 7S9cE . png Any ideas how to make it wrap nicely ? __label__4 Why are you uploading / changing badge files here? Surely you should just upload them to Commons then list the wikipedia version for deletion ? __label__4 Why would your 8 pts be in a 1 / 3 cube? Why not a 1 / 2 cube or a 9 / 10ths cube ? __label__4 I ' ve had enough of this. What would you think about filing a RfC ? __label__4 Just curious, who asked a question like that? Did you apply for a math heavy position without knowing what FFT is, or did you apply for a "normal" job and they asked you this ? __label__4 I have noticed that your objection to someone who unilaterally stops a straw poll. What, then, do you think of somebody who unilaterally ''starts'' a straw poll ? __label__4 You took me by surprise on this one with your comment - what about the obedience a diocesan priest owes to his bishop? And I was under the impression that all Latin - rite priests took simple vows of chastity ? __label__4 Do you really need to produce separate pdf files? Maybe the `\include` and `\includeonly` features would be enough for you ? __label__4 Seems like a roundabout way to get an address structure to me. Why not just pass "2a00 : 1450 : 8006::68" to `getaddrinfo`?__label__4 Kidding about what? Are there no reliable sources ? __label__4 Which API call is producing the exception in question? What are the permissions attached to the path that you aren ' t being allowed to access ? __label__4 Don ' t you think it ' s taken too far back to be of any use? Do we have any alternatives ? __label__4 You want to compress strings from argv, really? Or do you mean you want to treat argv ' s elements as names of files to compress, like gzip the program does ? __label__4 I don ' t see why you would prefer academic papers over actual solutions. For example, have you looked at how Doxygen does this ? __label__4 @Nick Usually they are <div class="section"> but sometimes there are other classes. Does that matter ? __label__4 We need no code to reverse a string. And, who would need a reversed string anyway ? __label__4 How does your grammar look like? It is a full - blown language, or just some math equation ? __label__4 Really? When / where did that happen ? __label__4 What do you mean by 'documents'? Something that looks like a report or just a spreadsheet full of numbers ? __label__4 Sorry, I still don ' t get it? You want the nodes to be edited / deleted by the same role as node author ? __label__4 I don ; t like commons because when i try to link things in the description it never works because it links only to commons. what is that ? __label__4 I assume you were directing these comments to Malcolm, who was reverted by multiple people (and who blatantly violated the 3RR, as pointed out on his talk page). Correct ? __label__4 I nominated <url> for speedy renaming to <url> and you removed it saying it was moved to /Working, but I don ' t see it there and it hasn ' t been renamed. Do you know what happened ? __label__4 I have not seen quotation sections on any other Australian politician page. Also, who chose these "quotations?" What qualifies as a quotation ? __label__4 Just a bit of feedback: assuming that this is the same question as your recent directed - acyclic - network before, it seems much clearer now. -- How ' s your linear algebra ? __label__4 I understand your point about MJ being very close and having competent editors, but do you not think those of us who understand the source problems, etc. that the Reagan page is having should try and explain them to those editors (that is, try to educate them)?__label__4 Since there ' s different tricks and none is the one right answer, shouldn ' t this be a community wiki ? __label__4 Reply: I have just found your edits to the talk page of the above article - not impressive at all? I suggest that you take this to <url> and explain why his edits need to be reverted and not yours ? __label__4 @shakti : that ' s not an issue . My question is why there is no output ?__label__4 Since I have not been able to get an answer to this on the project page, let me ask you directly: Did you receive Durova ' s "secret evidence" prior to the blocking of <url>?__label__4 You are moved <url>. You know that ''major warship'' is clasification in <url>s ?__label__4 That ' s a strange description. Do you mean that the graph is a tree ? __label__4 How exactly is a one - time martial arts tournament, all of whose participants are red - links, notable? Is Wikipedia to have separate articles for every martial arts tournament ever broadcast on television ? __label__4 Why not just use the onmousedown event as a trigger for whatever you ' re attempting to do instead? (What are you trying to achieve?)__label__4 Do you have any experience in Visual Basic? Have you tried reading a tutorial or a book ? __label__4 What type of Lycra? Polyster or Nylon ? __label__4 What is the purpose of implementing your own framework? Why not use an existing one ? __label__4 You say it ' s not compiling. Do you understand the error message ? __label__4 Wait, I thought algorithms were named for <url>??__label__4 I have no need to search the interwebs, all that matters is it offends people and is a violation of NPOV and MoS. "All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views (that have been published by reliable sources)" - ess - eff is a bias term for a minority group of fans, put it this way: is there an SF - channel, or how often is the clichxe9 ess - eff used outside fan - groups ? __label__4 I ' ve come to state that I find it mildly amusing that you don ' t consider a press release for a journalism award from Columbia University to be a "substantial story from a citable source". Isn ' t Columbia among the world ' s most prestigious journalism schools ? __label__4 Innovative? You mean, something that uses genetic algorithms that cloud compute on quantum computers ? __label__4 When someone explicitly states that they created the image themselves, then surely GFDL is at least implied? I know i forgot to add the tag but is it really necessary to put a delete template on the image ? __label__4 Further to what Stefan said, the tocloft package might be sensitive to other things you have in your preamble. Could you post a [minimum working example](http://meta . tex . stackexchange . com / questions / 228 / ive - just - been - told - i - have - to - write - a - minimal - example - what - is - that), please ? __label__4 That said, why remove any mention of the way the incomplete? This seems especially relevant because the American production ended in the same way, with no word from the editor stating that the perfect edition ending would be released ? __label__4 This is still, even after the edit, unclear. Do you want to say that she is right and this was the best she could have said in this situation, or do you want to ask her whether she has nothing better to say, or do you want to add to the answer and propose the best follow up to her remark ? __label__4 I ' ve gotten curious about your experiences interviewing Russians. Would you go into details please ? __label__4 I only used approved templates. If they are not considered polite, why have them ? __label__4 Actually, the page is still up, and I ' m still getting a deluge of obscene phone calls and emails in an effort to punish me for constructive editing on Wikipedia consistent with Wikipedia policies and guidelines. Is <url> and <url> a policy or isn ' t it ? __label__4 @yossarian: Have you made this yet? How did it work out ? __label__4 I use that template, because it cannot be missed on a page, because it allows for different reasons for blocking (template : blocked is "vandalism", only, and takes 2 edits to change to something else), and because it gives instructions for requesting unblock. What is the objection to it ? __label__4 Homework? Who told you that checking the precondition is a bad idea ? __label__4 I refer you to my last answer about independent sources. Do you have press coverage ? __label__4 I presume you haven ' t obliterated them completely, because that would be to be editorialise enormously. Where have you put them instead ? __label__4 Please clarify your definition of bacon. Perhaps with a picture ? __label__4 How ' s tricks, JRM? Lying kind of low, aren ' t you ? __label__4 ..and how small are you hoping the hash result will be, given that the input is only 11 bytes? Or do you mean there are 11 separate values ? __label__4 That sounds like an old domain parking page. Does "Fetch as Googlebot" give you any response to the /robots . txt ?__label__4 He ' s gone. Was it something I said ? __label__4 What City in Connecticut do you live in? And have you been to the north as your name suggests ? __label__4 I don ' t see why the trivial greedy algorithm does not work? Am I missing something ? __label__4 Why did you remove those German emigrant cases. Shouldn ' t we include those cases of people who was born in what was then Germany at the time ? __label__4 Did you see JzG <url> James Cantor that his alleged COI prohibits him from editing any BLPs related to his academic field? Didn ' t the AN discussion after the last round actually repudiate JzG ' s stance on this ? __label__4 You just added it again. Maybe you should look over the guidelines for inclusion of the tag ? __label__4 @jtbandes Its not a home work.. i wanted to know the appropriate algoritm basically. @pascal using temporary dictionary means using extra memory ( storage)?__label__4 The last sentence looks a little contradictory. Does it copy your generated config and then overwrites it ? __label__4 You said: "I am just upset that you are harassing a person who seems to be trying to better himself and his relationship with fellow wikipedians." First, I ' m harrassing no - one, and it would be better if you didn ' t make such accusations. Secondly, what evidence do you see that SS is trying to do anything of the kind ? __label__4 Your question reads as if you ' ve already found a solution. What is the problem ? __label__4 Hmm, page says you are unavailable right now. This means you wont be fixing up <url> any time soon ? __label__4 No other encyclopedia deals with these charges in their entries on Reagan; encyclopedias have higher standards than supermarket tabloids and Kitty Kelley. On that note, why not post the content you want in the <url> article instead ? __label__4 Hello Glacier109, I am contacting you because in golf they put Money not Winnings as the standard on most leaderboards used at the end of tournaments. I am just wondering why you selected the word winnings ? __label__4 If a then b is true for any b provided that a is false, as it is in your question. So how do you hope to learn anything interesting ? __label__4 I hate that they give no choices for being anonymous. Why do I have to use my real full name to sign up ? __label__4 I think you need to describe better what you ' re trying to do. You want to break up the string into substrings of a certain length ? __label__4 Is this really about physics? I can see why it ' s a valid question, and I can see there ' s physics behind it, but is the question itself about physics ? __label__4 It ' s not clear that this is a programming question. What are you looking for ? __label__4 Eight Days of Malaise, What is your favorite whois application and why ? __label__4 If someone is an immigrant and not legally documented, that someone is an illegal immigrant. How can such a rally be anything but pro - illegal - immigration ? __label__4 How can a permablocked user edit? And who would set up a sockpuppet months in advance ? __label__4 Isn ' t this a way to rephrase: "Fast, Good or Cheap. Pick Two" ?__label__4 If so, that ' s a hell of a perf hit to take just to show the user a moving progress indicator. Why not just show a spinning ball or similar while the file is copying ? __label__4 Sry this explains to me.. I want to rewrite this solution [link](http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 5636413 / how - to - determine - maximum - route - cost - in - a - n - high - numeric - pyramid) in ruby. And why did you say poorly implementing ? __label__4 @Adam: Thanks! Any suggestions / comments for the site ? __label__4 The Hitchin - related hoax claims by <url> seem to have led to a rather precipitate response, considering that he has only been an editor for a few days. Is there something going on here that isn ' t obvious ? __label__4 You ' re not "removing" duplicates -- you ' re merging them. Right ? __label__4 May I ask why you removed <url> from the article on <url>? Since CAP is the USAF ' s official auxiliary, wouldn ' t it make sense for the CAP article to be in the USAF category ? __label__4 What ' s the point of subfeatures if you can ' t save them to a file? Is there some other format I can save that preserves subfeatures ? __label__4 Thanks! Can you please explain me in a way that a mere CS major can understand, how can I get this filter, and what should this filter, erm, filter ? __label__4 uh, okay lol :) no, i dont think i am (although i dont remember drinking any at all..), and um? okay ? __label__4 Sure, but that ' s true of any investment you make. What are the top 50 features in a word processor ? __label__4 I ' m not proficient in Japanese, so correct me if I ' m saying something dumb, but last time I checked, か was a *final* interrogative particle, coming at the very end of a sentence and not changing the intonation of the rest of it, like, *at all*. As to your English examples, would you regard the rewordings "Are you running into.." and "Is (it really (so that)) the fastest way.." as sacrificing the content / format / impact ? __label__4 I don ' t have the delete privilege assigned to my account. What are you talking about ? __label__4 This is clearly them being just as congenial and accurate as always.<url> What is the appropriate place to report them ? __label__4 Miten sxe4 osaat nii hyvin suomee jos sun xe4idinkieli on kumminki englanti? Onks sul suomenkieliset vanhemmat tai jotai vai ootsxe4 vaa opiskellu ite tosi paljo suomee ? __label__4 I see that KarBot is editing User Talk Pages. Is this deliberate ? __label__4 You ' re mentioned <url>. What do we know about these images ? __label__4 Can you give me a link to "We Are Defiance" ? And what do you mean by "remove" : 1) moving to the main space or 2) deleting the article ?__label__4 No idea what feature you refer to (don ' t think it is something native), please elaborate? Also self - hosted WordPress or wordpress . com blog ? __label__4 Your formatting makes it seem like your perl script actually calls each line in tick marks. Is that the way you ' re running it, or is it bad formatting ? __label__4 Does it do anything other than deselect it? That seems a little redundant, why not just uncheck the checkbox ? __label__4 What signatures are you referring to? Could you please clarify your question ? __label__4 I ' m not going to get involved in the content dispute. But I ' m pleased to see you finally taking this seriously: its no longer ''all in good fun'', perhaps ? __label__4 I realise it may seem ridiculous, but until the copyright holder has released it, we cannot use it (except under a claim of fair use, but this wouldn ' t fall under our rather strict <url>). I will delete the image now- why not draw your own map ? __label__4 IMDB calls her Ethyl, not Ethel. Which is it ? __label__4 The second example in your second question accesses unallocated memory. Was that on purpose ? __label__4 Is this really notable? Time for an AfD nom ? __label__4 So, does the above comment imply that the answer to the OP ' s question is 'No such examples can be constructed.'? Or perhaps, some pathological example exists which violates the assumptions behind admissibility ? __label__4 Could you post a small example code showing exactly which space do you want to reduce? Also which environment are you trying to redefine ? __label__4 Please clarify your problem. Are you looking for some P2P solution, or want to play with the IP header ? __label__4 Not reproducible. What is `EnvironTypes`?__label__4 It helps if you mention what operating system you ' re using. It is Ubuntu, Debian, or something else ? __label__4 Wait a minute! I ' ve done plenty of good edits, where did they all go ? __label__4 Is there any point to the quotation that ' s not served equally by the link on its own? Other than the obvious (which I ' d like to think you ' re above), which is trolling the student pollies ? __label__4 Is this like a printing error on a postage stamp, i . e. a rarity ? __label__4 @Ofeargall - Welcome to the community. Could you please elaborate on what you mean "want to know" vs "need to know"?__label__4 Can ' t you just filter out the value NULL before you process the records? Or did I miss something ? __label__4 I ' m not seeing it. Has it been fixed ? __label__4 Is this a business website or a consumer oriented website? Or are you asking for solutions to both scenarios ? __label__4 The flag "visible=yes" means a comment on the page is made visible, not that the page is visible in search engines. Why did you remove flag ? __label__4 Testing, testing, 1 , 2, 3, are you still alive? Where are you ? __label__4 Do you not have even tiny holes for ventilation you could sample through? And do you regard a toothpick hole as looking really bad ? __label__4  " doing math on the file as if it were one long number" sounds like a bad idea! What method is this ? __label__4 this is not merging, this is sorting. BTW what are those objects (a1 b1 ..) string ? __label__4 Why wouldn ' t you want to go to the source code? What ' s the purpose of debugging if not for checking the code ? __label__4 Did you restart the server? Why do you need to change it anyway - you can serve content in any locale ? __label__4 Can you explain what you mean by 'marking up reusable elements' a nd 'standardized markup'? Do you mean reusing code (i . e. snippets of logic / functionality) or reusing UI elements ? __label__4 @dan and sri, Sorry if this is too far from the original question, but is there a manner of linking (ie. the type of URL I use in my post) I can use to attempt to maintain the header (I ' m *imagining* some `rel=` attribute to the effect of the capturing it), or does HTTPS always strip it out ? __label__4 If it ' s TRUE white noise (static) it ' s at all frequencies equally and unfilteranle. What kind of noise is it really ? __label__4 A module that is causing a fatal error because it ' s invoking a method of a non - object is clearly a bug in a module; it ' s difficult to say which module is causing the error, as the error is appending in a Views file, but it could depend from a parameter passed to a Views function from another module. (Is it Panels or APK?)__label__4 Could this be sublimed to something that is best described as a development manifesto? Is that what we should, essentially, be looking for ? __label__4 Why do you need to take factorials of such large numbers? What will you do with the results ? __label__4 Sorry, but I dont understand. How should I check ?__label__4 What is the source of this image? and why do you think it ' s PD ? __label__4 What ' s "shortening"? Is that another name for margarines ? __label__4 Wikipedia is not IMDb, which can easily be used (and is more suited) to providing complete soundtrack listings for pretty much every movie ever made. Would you care to address any of the other points I ' ve brought up ? __label__4 What this statement do is giving you "no hire" on interview and severe pay cut if found in production code. May be professor will like this answer? :)__label__4 Is there any way I could talk you into being more conservative with creation of new articles? Do you agree that some of what you ' re creating here would be seen as obviously deletable material by most editors ? __label__4 Not completely so, because my question is more specific in terms of hash size and ignores performance. Also I am not just looking for _a_ hash function, I am looking for a meaningful choice -- I know there are CRC32 and FNV32, but which is better for my domain ? __label__4 What ' s the purpose of this? How do you want to use them ? __label__4 Please, show a minimal example. Are you using the setspace package or other tools that enlarge the interline space ? __label__4 What is exactly your problem? What does not work ? __label__4 Images are always rectangular, how are you creating anything different? Are you looking for [image maps](http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Image _ map)?__label__4 what have you tried? There are over 200 questions here on SO about random numbers, have you had a look on some of them ? __label__4 What do you mean "wont"? What ' s the error or result that you aren ' t expecting ? __label__4 How many other states follow the same pattern? And do we really need it to ? __label__4 I don ' t understand your concern with "the user might think that margins contains only :left and :right". How is it different when you use the chart . marings(:left, 10) syntax ?__label__4 It might depend on your messaging app -- HTC phones with Sense don ' t have the standard android mesages app, for example. What phone do you have ? __label__4 Err, okay. But let ' s make sure our answers are accurate by using <url> rather than something we heard someone say, eh ? __label__4 You are doing a regex match but not checking whether it succeeded or using its results in any way. What change to you want to happen to `$name`?__label__4 Interesting. Are these log - based analytics or something like Google Analytics ? __label__4 Are you calling me a vandal for visiting your user page? Or am I just <url>?__label__4 What ' s all the .strip() doing in the parsing rules? Shouln ' t your lexer take care of removing trailing whitespace ? __label__4 Are they a particular type of files? Do all users have access to all the files and do they require it ? __label__4 What is your definition of a "small change" in the output? Edit distance (treating hashes as strings) or mathematical distance of numbers (treating hashes as integers?)__label__4 I thought we had already established consensus last month. What exactly is the deal with the parenthesis and columns ? __label__4 what about my answer? didn ' t it help ? __label__4 Straightforward solution with iterating over sub - array to find an average, won ' t it have `O ( n)`? Why `O ( n^2)`?__label__4 Are you trying to print the possible ways to express your number as a sum? You know there are an infinite number of ways to do that, right ? __label__4 The admin says he thinks it should be renamed, but someone else is trying to pull the "but it happened in the same area nonsense". Was I clear enough in explaining where the pictures are listed ? __label__4 The first step is where the magic lies, I guess. Care to elaborate please ?__label__5 You ' re talking about computing the coefficients of the polynomial, right? Is this equivalent to computing the product of $\sqrt { n}$ $\sqrt { n}$-bit integers in time $\tilde O ( n \log n)$ (where $\tilde O$ hides sub - logarithmic factors)?__label__5 Not that this really needs much more discussion but how did the object described as "creepy" change from the email in your first sentence to the administrator in the second? Especially when the original edit stated that the email was creepy, not the administrator ? __label__5 You do realise that it ' s not likely to be much cheaper unless you rebuild the wheels yourself ? __label__5 You again speak of "the probability of interest", whereas I made it clear that either there is only one probability of interest, and hence it cannot depend on the door numbers, or there are several probabilities of interest, all with the same value, and hence independent of the numbers of the doors. Don ' t you understand this ? __label__5 Why did you just do that? I am being serious - what business was it of yours exactly ? __label__5 @Gene Why is it that a handcrafted parser will beat a C++ parser generator? Considering that writing a hand - crafted parser is a lot of code, isn ' t it possible that the hand - crafted parser could be much slower ? __label__5 If you had such a list, what on earth would you do with it? The list of names in each category doesn ' t seem very interesting by itself; surely you don ' t want to actually process the content of all those grammars ? __label__5 Herlihy & Shavit ' s book, The Art of Multiprocessor Programming, or ["Lock - free linked lists and skip lists"](http://ww . cse . yorku . ca/~ruppert / Mikhail . pdf) or [java . util . concurrent](http://download . oracle . com / javase / 6 / docs / api / java / util / concurrent / ConcurrentSkipListMap . html) or [Practical lock - freedom](http://ww . cl . cam . ac . uk / research / srg / netos / lock - free/). Have you considered using a concurrent hash table like a [hopscotch hash table](https://sites . google . com / site / cconcurrencypackage / hopscotch - hashing)?__label__5  " Provocations"? How is it provoking to suggest to an American - expat that calling people in Taiwan "Taiwanese" is not controversial ? __label__5 Eight more articles semi - protected. How many of these damned T & J articles are there ? __label__5 @Gabi: what is the point of having n greater than say 32 or 64 ? It seems like an arbitrary and unnecessary requirement ?__label__5 What is the problem? To identify the liars ? __label__5 how did you create the plot? Through some mathematical applications ? __label__5 BTW, I ' m amazed that he has the gumption to show his mug after <url>. And do you have the balls (metaphorically or otherwise) to place a hatnote above his article linking to that term ? __label__5 iPhone 3 . 3? Do you work for Apple or something ? __label__5 no offense, kid, but you ' re trying to build a chess game and are struggling to put labels on a board? Don ' t you think this kind of program is a little bit out of your league ? __label__5 do you own any C++ books? if yes then why dont you try searching this in that ?__label__5 I ' m not even sure who this person is! Which page is this about ? __label__5 Also are you complete sold with VSFTPD? Or would you be interested in other types of FTP softwares like pureftp ? __label__5 So, I ' m a "deletion fanatic"? Why don ' t you refrain from uncivil remarks and focus on adding sources to your unsourced stubs - help the encyclopedia rather than pissing off people ? __label__5 I ' ve updated the question to specify that it ' s verbal feedback we need to record (sorry for the ambiguity). That noted, would such a system work with a member of the team adding clients' comments on their behalf ? __label__5 You won ' t even let the ink on your report dry and you ' re already at it again. Care to explain finally what about the DAB needs "cleaning"?__label__5 Hardcore the password? Would that make it a password to an adult site ? __label__5 smells like homework. what have you tried ? __label__5 @phwd: 25MB + 1 byte of zeros. does it matter ? __label__5 I am not sure why (1) is not a way to do (2). Anyway could you please provide more detail on how to go about doing (1)?__label__5 What are you uploading the images for? Is it something that your theme will reference, or something that you want users to have access to and to be able to re - use images that you already posted in their own content ? __label__5 Not sure if you are saying that I am beating a dead horse in raising the inclusion criteria problem again.. or if Doncram is doing so in objecting to my doing so again. Or is it both ? __label__5 I see you created a nonsense article yesterday because you were bored. If I unblock you will you disrupt more ? __label__5 I suspect that `'apt - get install libpq - dev` didn ' t work properly, as the 9 . 04 distro is no longer supported (too old). Can you run the `pg _ config` command ? __label__5 Oh that ' s charming, so instead of making a personal attack on a single editor you made it on a class of editors. Does that somehow make it more ok ? __label__5 What is the actual question? And have you considered using punctuation ? __label__5 Here, let me parse it out for you:''I regret that because Gravitor and Carfiend ' s behavior consists of acting in tandem (in the manner of meat or sock puppets), refuse to discuss disputed content on the talk page, and continally provoke revert wars that some administrative intervention is likely required. '' Is it clear now ? __label__5 OK, I ' ll bite. How is ''Matt "Dirty" Sanchez'' to be construed as anything other than a personal attack ? __label__5 Fine, but it took me no more than a couple of seconds to find a source. Why couldn ' t you do it instead of removing the content ? __label__5 Well, I fully agree with the three rationales Lumos has given above; and so evidently do about half the Wikipedians who have contributed to the RfC Lumos has cited. If so many think that such links can be useful and appreciated, why does it matter so much to you that they should be eradicated ? __label__5 You tags are misleading - Algorithm, data structures and in your question you are asking for an answer to the puzzle. what do you want ? __label__5 If its your homework you should possibly do it yourself. Have you even tried it ? __label__5 One final thing: "If anything, many vegetarians are characterized by their disapproval of non - violence (towards animals)." You do realise that you are saying, here, that many vegetarians approve of violence towards animals? Is that really what you meant ? __label__5 PS - surprised you didn ' t make the annoucement in your blog. Trying to fool your hordes of devoted readers ? __label__5 I don ' t want to type my credentials in again. Couldn ' t you just give me an admin role and handle the authorization in your code ? __label__5 Career advice questions like this one are too localized for this site. Please see [Are Career Advice questions useful for anyone except the poster](http://meta . programmers . stackexchange . com / questions / 588 / are - career - advice - questions - useful - to - anyone - except - the - poster / 590 # 590)?__label__5 You ' re doing two times the same thing (2xforeach) and the previous variant might just overwrite the option if the not set in $_REQUEST. Probably this is the issue ? __label__5 Your first attempt at doing this also added a <nowiki>"<url>"</nowiki> line to the article, and that ' s what triggered the bot. Perhaps you should get into the habit of using the 'Show changes button ? __label__5 Why would you doubt that. And for that matter why wouldn ' t you rewrite it yourself ? __label__5 Thanks, but I ' ve already read those essays. Did you have anything to say yourself, personally ? __label__5 I find your decision to put the deepest level element as value and all parents as key somewhat weird. How are you going to know what to take from the array - key or value ? __label__5 Is this a exercise in ideology? Views is very well suited to this task, why not use it ? __label__5 @Rajendra: I have read it carefully, and both the original problem and the converted problem can be interpreted in multiple ways. Is it that hard to give a yes or no answer ? __label__5 Huh? What was that supposed to mean ? __label__5 I ' m not understanding "The first paragraph of http://ww . ctan . org / starter . html needs an update." How, please ? __label__5 Well, I bet you got that from stalking me. Are you making a template I can use ? __label__5 Do you want a yes or no answer? Is this homework ? __label__5 it was a joke. why so serious ? __label__5 COBOL homework? Where do they even do that?!__label__5 Why "arrested" in the title? "Given a ticket" makes more sense, I would think ? __label__5 This statement by The Four Deuces <url> makes little sense to me, does this user often obfuscate like this? The source is quite unambiguous in stating "communist terrorists" how on earth does this not mean the author is talking of communist terrorism ? __label__5 Isn ' t that a bit of an odd measure? Would you choose to become a factory worker because it ' s *easier* and *faster to learn*?__label__5 ''I just take care of the problem.'' Can ' t you work ''with'' me, and not ''against'' me ? __label__5 You also seem to have 'Web' there twice. Which browser are you using, and do you have any greasemonkey scripts or plugins which may be breaking the links ? __label__5 Your scanned images provide northing and depth (and, somewhat mysteriously, easting), so you have all the coordinates you need. What exactly is the obstacle then ? __label__5 Instead of another 3O, why don ' t you put in a <url>. And no, it ' s not a threat - it ' s an observation - why don ' t you <url>?__label__5 Remember we had the whole edit warring on Edelsten article a while back? I find it curious that a recently created account posted this <url> as their first contribution basically supporting Edelsten ' s personal website (which when you look would hardly pass <url>, I looked it at this site a while back in research and found some of the positive claims could not be verified) and wanting a complete rewrite of the article.. sound familiar ? __label__5 Post you linked to also has non - edit filter solution by Otto. Had you tried that ? __label__5 The text of your warning <url> made me smile. Did you really think that if China got a new Prime Minister as of today, and a female one at that, it wouldn ' t be all over the news, and the link to this person would be red ? __label__5 You mean that you are looking at the distribution of subsample **lengths** of subsegments covering each position, right? On the other hand (probably I ' m wrong) I ' m guessing it has something to do with the sequencing ? __label__5  " Loops are forbidden"? What sort of nonsensical assignment is this ? __label__5 I ' m still scratching my head. How can this be ? __label__5 To ''Arbcom''? Aren ' t we being a bit dramatic here when other forms of dispute resolution have not been tried ? __label__5 Of the two answers, you chose to accept the one with 3 downvotes vs. the one with 7 upvotes?!__label__5 Is Google Voice actually a Web App? Or is it more a smartphone app ? __label__5 Who would be helped by this? Is all that work really going to help someone ? __label__5 p . s. I ' d be right that you ' re a supporter of corporal punishment, I presume ? __label__5 According to your comments to some of the answers you don ' t want to use neither locks nor interlocked operations, yet you want the operation to be locked. How do you think you can achieve licking without using, well, locking ? __label__5 This question basically tells me nothing about what the actual problem is. Also, what ' s a "pathway"?__label__5 And this is your first edit. Isn ' t that interesting ? __label__5 @Mitch: I have given you my answer. Can you give your ' s now ? __label__5 @space _ cadet: Thanks for your answer . I have two question for you . Could please let me know how the conterfactual states are generated in the first place and what is the role of \alpha s in getting rid of them ? Because I ' ve always just been taught that measurement gives each possible state with probability Tr(\Pi_\alpha \rho) for different possible projections and we never talked about inconsistent states! And the second question is in a talk by Rob Spekkens (from PI) he said he believes an adequate set of postulates for quantum mechanics shouldn ' t have this inner - outer problem ! What do you think ? __label__5 I ' m assuming that you want to delete the email messages on the non - Gmail account. Which email provider are you using ? __label__5 Thanks, but I believe I ' ve covered the sustance. Could you also get Beeblebrox to strike the "Mr" insult, unless he was doing it deliberately ? __label__5 I ' m attempting to be incisive, and the articles integrity hasn ' t been disrupted. Therefore i see no reason why you chose to comment unless you felt that ive wiped out important information ? __label__5 I often work out of Sweden and I have an excellent, free, built - in English or Swedish grammar ''and'' spelling program in ''Word'' on that computer using Firefox (as this user says she does) - red underlinings for spelling and green for grammar - which would preclude almost all of the huge amount of problems caused by this user regarding readability, or at least alert her to the very quanitity of the problems and inspire a constructive attitude as to her own capacity. Perhaps if one does not consider it a "duty" of sorts to contribute readable English here, that actually might be the problem ? __label__5 Why do you ask me questions to which you already know the answers? Is it a rhetorical device ? __label__5 There are 788657867364790503552363213932185062295135977687173263294742533244359449963403342920304284011984623904177212138919638830257642790242637105061926624952829931134628572707633172373969889439224456214516642402540332918641312274282948532775242424075739032403212574055795686602260319041703240623517008587961789227896237038973747200 permutations of 200 - element set. You want them all ? __label__5 I am genuinely trying to do something useful and helpful. Why are you attacking it ? __label__5 I think your question is too vague. What are the properties of Irony that you want ? __label__5 I have also seen people recommending tasksel. Maybe someone could explain what this one is good for too ? __label__5 I don ' t know these tools, but re: *Ability to restrict password cracking* - I doubt that ' s what you mean - you really can ' t prevent someone from trying to crack a password hash, since it can be done on other machines. Do you mean restricted access to the password hashes ? __label__5 well.. where is the problem? what results *are* you getting ? __label__5 You can do just about anything with one pin of a micro. More specific please ? __label__5 Maybe you should consider a user name change? To, say, "Sarah 'The Hammer' Ewart"?__label__5 @Andrew Just out of curiosity, will it still work in LaTeX3? Is that even a concern ? __label__5 The page is getting smacked literally every half minute or so, and I think the joke ' s worn thin. Give us a break ? __label__5 Need more information — Does this happen on other WiFi Access Points? Are your iDevices Jailbroken ? __label__5 Doing a redundant `atoi` after you just did `strtol` is probably the most twisted insult to the proper use of string - to - int conversion functions in C one can come up with. Why do you see the need to "re - convert" the value using the broken function `atoi` when you already have it as `val` from a proper function `strtol`?__label__5 Just think about it. If, unlike Saudi Arabia, the US is the Land of the Free, then how come you are only allowed to drink <url>?__label__5 As @Woot4Moo points out, you have already asked this question AND received decent starting points in the replies. So what have YOU done ? __label__5 I didn ' t know that you had to use an email address instead of a username. When did that change ? __label__5 May I suggest you actually read the article before claiming it not to be nonsense and removing my CSD tag? Are you an admin ? __label__5 The haven ' t first team appearances for gods sake! How can you say they deserve an article ? __label__5 why such a large file? Is this a one time thing or is this a on going problem ? __label__5 @LarsOn: Excuse me? I don ' t understand a word you are saying ? __label__5 So..what ' s up with this article? Is it a joke ? __label__5 By 'annoying alternate rows', are you talking about banding? Or what exactly is the problem ? __label__5 Your obfuscation of the real issue is disengenuous; I ' m rapidly losing respect for you. Is it not Wikipedia ' s mission to scornfully snub vandalism, which is done instantly, agressively, mercilessly ? __label__5 I ' m not sure what your problem is. Aren ' t you sure about how to automatically data bind it ? __label__5 How many times do I have to revert you before you stop? Do you want to get blocked ? __label__5 So you deny you did anything wrong Jason? And we ' re all Nazi ' s persecuting you, Itake and Uncle Davey ? __label__5 karthick, that was a great answer. Could you please add some info on OCRFeeder to mark it as the accepted answer ? __label__5 maxint**maxint is a number with >>750 decimals, i hope you ' re not really suprised it takes a while. Also what is supposed to happen when a number does not fit into 32 bit ? __label__5 So? Are you expecting us to do your homework for you?? :-) Ok , here ' s a hint.. what ' s the type of `"a" | "b"`?__label__5 Wow, what are you doing that requires the microcontrollers to be so hot? Can ' t you just put the mcu outside of the hot area, maybe running wires to some sensors inside ? __label__5 Sounds like homework. Where is your own effort ? __label__5 The deletion review page linked above contains all the instructions for requesting a review. Why did you not read these instructions ? __label__5 Niveau? Do you mean level ? __label__5 Thank you for this code . But when I put it in my file the title "Table of content" doesn ' t change. Could you help me, please ? __label__5 OK done. When do I get my money ? __label__5 Does this only happen on multiplayer? Or does it happen on single - player too ? __label__5 Why are you trying to delete my user page, literally less than a minute after I began it. You are allowed one so why not me ? __label__5 I certainly think more things should be deleted from enwiki, but TheCommunity ( tm) is fickle. Are you complaining about something ''I'' did ? __label__5 It looks like you ' re looking for free as in 'free beer', not free as in 'free speech'. Is this correct ? __label__5 eh, i ' ve ALWAYS hated 50 meter pools (200 butterfly was always the BIGGEST pain in the ass) although i really did like butterfly for some reason.. never quite got that, so was it an indoor or outdoor pool??__label__5 Why not? And why on earth do you have these absurd constraints ? __label__5 Can you post a link to which themes you ' ve downloaded. Also, are you using the stock launcher or some other customised one like ADW or Launcher Pro ? __label__5 Sounds like a good homework question. Does your instructor know you ' re cheating ? __label__5 I absolutely don ' t understand the question. What is this supposed to mean "and the difference between the scores of 10 and 18 relatively more higher than 18 and 20"?__label__5 This sounds bizarre. Can you explain WHY you have to do it this way ? __label__5 Ah well, if you are going to have such a bizarre flight of fancy as far as to calling it an attack page then perhaps I will remove it. Maybe you should also look at how you interact with others ? __label__5 of <url> as those were just plain old copyedit (replacing begining of paragraph "he"'s with the name and a template fix). I ' m assuming you were on the cell phone again ? __label__5 And DAB uses a very foul language, persistently, is that right? Did I not talk to you about that already ? __label__5 Boy, am I glad I don ' t have to eat your salmon. No offense, but I detest fennel, while I think dill is perfectly fine. Why would you want your fish tasting of licorice ? __label__5 What did you end up choosing? I ' m looking at using custom layers or plug - in data source are there any more issues other than the ones you and Kirk mentioned ? __label__5 IIRC, this is the same problem as with volume buttons on some ThinkPads.. the hardware *just does it* and then also sends out a signal saying the button ' s been pressed. Possibly you could unset the shortcut in System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts for this action ? __label__5 And what is your question? Surely you don ' t expect a solution, as then you wouldn ' t have been doing your homework ? __label__5 I see that you are becoming a little bit paranoid. Do i need to do a check user for you ?__label__5 excuse me ? - class ?__label__5 An algorithm..for what? Mine placement ? __label__5 <url> Honestly, I ' d like to know if you really are defending <url>. Do you really believe that they were justified ? __label__5 So why didn ' t you just look through the source, to see if there was a number there? Or why didn ' t you simply ask the editor on their talk page ? __label__5 You make it very hard to believe that you ' re acting in good faith when you rewrite the <url> article to remove all references to "liberal," but keep the phrase "conservative Independence Institute." I see POV - pushing when that happens. If you ' re so concerned about adjectives, why not edit the articles about AEI or Heritage or Americans for Tax Reform ? __label__5 I tend to prefer amsmath `\begin { equation*}` over `\[`, because it feels more semantic and makes the source more human - readable. But I really don ' t know, is there any difference between these two ? __label__5 Holy sh * t, $100 an hour? Where do I sign up ? __label__5 I will say this, though, in the form of a suggestion: it makes me a bit uneasy to see you so involved and sometimes argumentative in your nomination. Why not step back and let the community do its thing ? __label__5 He keeps coming back, and keeps getting blocked again.. When will they learn ? __label__5 And this is why you ' re asking all the stupid questions ? __label__5 BTW you typo ' d the declaration of `bytes _ read`. And what on earth is "incertitude"?__label__5 could you give an example, please. What oportunity do you mean ? __label__5 Why would you want to round in such a strange way? How would this be useful for money rounding ? __label__5 Dont get you. Looks exactly the same in IE9 and FF5 . 01 on Windows 7 ? __label__5 Hey, can you block this moron from editing the IIHF Page? Or what can i do in such cases ? __label__5 What technical reasons might those be? Do you understand how similar `require` and `use` are ? __label__5 *"Obviously"*. Why not ? __label__5 Especially considering that it took you ''a lot'' more time to vandalize the page than the two seconds it took us to fix it. What ' s the point ? __label__5 I can ' t help but think that you ' re making this much more complicated than it should be. HTML already handles word wrapping beautifully, why would you manually add line breaks to text that has characters with dynamic width ? __label__5 Soap on porous clay sounds like a good way to make your water taste like.. soap. Perhaps consider disinfecting with a bleach solution instead ? __label__5 @Kory, please elaborate, on what grounds do you suggest that? What do you suggest the problem is ? __label__5 You say "My solution involves a tree", but surely that doesn ' t fall under the "using only bit manipulation" criteria, does it? As such, it ' s not really a solution is it ? __label__5 No - one ' s saying you can ' t edit anything, but what we are saying is that introducing grammatically incorrect phrases, POV, weasel words and things discussed and discounted in the numerous PRs and FLCs this article went through is inappropriate. Buc, stop it please, I ' m getting tired of this, why not work on being constructive to articles that aren ' t at featured status ? __label__5 Huh? A downvote? What for ? __label__5 And now you undid my declination of that one which was copyrighted. Would you ''please'' quit undoing my declinations ? __label__5 You know there ' s no excuse for the edits you ' re making related to your position at <url>. This has to go to <url>; would you like to make the report ? __label__5 How do you know the author / uploader of <url> intended it to be licenced under the copyright licence that you attached to the file with <url> Are you clairvoyant or did the uploader tell you this was his wish ? __label__5 Hm. Are you asking to be banned ? __label__5 Why did you delete the article on anal stretching??__label__5 Sorry, I should ' ve made it clearer there are other text, figures and tables contained within leftbar as well - I omitted them because this was a minimal example. So that doesn ' t appear to be an option for me.. Any other ideas Stef, or others ? __label__5 Cla, your partisanship is indeed fairly obvious, and pointing to one article where you ' ve deliberately been good isn ' t good enough. So: if I point you to my stand against AJL, will you declare me to be non - partisan ? __label__5 Looks pretty much like python problem. Why don ' t you post this to yum bugtracker ? __label__5 Now why would you do that when he specifically stated that he didn ' t want to discuss the matter for 48 hours and I specifically stated that people should come here? Did you not read his request ? __label__5  " non - default screen resolutions when using virtual display over screen sharing" — a statement, not a question. Please: do you *prefer*, or wish to *avoid* the non - default resolutions ? __label__5 Without making a comment on the underlying coverage of the site being down, your edit comment <url> indicates a <url> violation. Under what logic do you propose that you have authority to set policy over the article ? __label__5 Could you provide a *minimal* example that reproduces the problem? Do you really need to load all those packages to get the bug to kick in ? __label__5 Why do you want 50 threads? And what is it that they are supposed to be doing exactly ? __label__5 Could you please elaborate on the problem ? What is happening when you try to access some https site ?__label__5 That is an interesting problem, but would be time consuming and costly to determine every possible result. Why not create a buffer ? __label__5 what ' s wrong with this place? how has this question been up for an hour and no one has made a Bob Ross reference ? __label__5 Not even proper sentences? Are you currently in an exam ? __label__5 It might help to give some details about the problem, other than general "it works in debug but not in release." What is "it", what is "it"?__label__5 This sounds like homework. Also, Lisp is built around recursion, why do you want to avoid it ? __label__5 Its not a homework people, my colleaugue asked me to help him with some algorithm, this is only a part of that, I simplified it in terms of normal array objects, anyways the data consist of approximately 100 elements, so if you could help us with atleast a better( efficient algorithm). and who tagged this is as homework??__label__5 Guess that makes this community wiki. Don ' t you think ? __label__5 @Moron : I am not here to get my work done, but to learn better ways from other people, and perhaps help them if I can. BTW .. Why are YOU wasting your time with that comments ? __label__5 Yes, the "licking my balls" thing. Why am I not surprised that that was his work too ? __label__5 <url> - I removed a see - also to a link placed by a COI - editor pointing to a topic about himself, which duplicated an existing link on the same topic. Exactly what is <em>your</em> reason for the template on my user page ? __label__5 Why did you remove my comment from your page? What was the reason for that ? __label__5 So what ' s the question? Is it "will you do this homework for me"?__label__5 @Oli Because I believe that you ' re a troll, could you please not take part in any form in any of my future questions? Will you be able to respect my wish ? __label__5 @I Never Finish Anythi madness would be great Fun. How do I get infested by madness ? __label__5 You do not appear to have alerted the other previous Delete advocates yet. May we take this as a tacit admission that actually you ''were'' intending to skew the deletion review ? __label__5 Hello??__label__5 Wait, that wasn ' t the question, was it. What appears after these that I don ' t have ? __label__5 If possible, try using the VGA cable to hook the iPad up to a regular monitor. Does that give you the same result ? __label__5 What resolution? What do you consider low - cost ? __label__5 Oh, lookee <url>: who put all the 'breakups' back with a blind revert??__label__5 Really annoying default behaviour. How did you disable it ? __label__5 Why on earth would that make for bad chicken salad ? __label__5 Is 'find . -name *.c' not simple enough ? __label__5 @Brian R Bondy: Isn ' t that a fault of the answers, and not of the question ? Or should the question be made more precisely ? __label__5 When you deleted <url> did you accidentally overlook the <person> template? Or do you have some reason for ignoring it ? __label__5 What do you mean it "did not work"? What happened ? __label__5 This REEKS of a question asked in a panic before an assignment is due. Nothing wrong with seeking clarification, but are we really here to answer verbatim questions ? __label__5 Hmm, you are basically asking me to think positively despite evidence and knowing that over this issue none good faith on part of some users was showed in past, but ok, letxb4s see how it goes. The question then is: do you consider including the discussions with outside mediation participants that happend on those talk - pages (direktor, for exemple, has been very active and enthusiastic there lately) or only the in - mediation discussions are the ones that count ? __label__5 Could you please clarify who the new users were exactly that you considered to be part of your 'sock farm'? Or did you not even bother to research before making such claims ? __label__5 Shouldn ' t every professional programmer be able to do such things? Isn ' t that part of a being programmer ? __label__5 @RPM1984: its just so utterly wrong though! You seem like a smart guy, where did you get the idea from ? __label__5 Without participating in talk page discussion, you have deleted reliable sources, and rewritten a sentence so that it is supported by no sources at all except your personal opinion.<url> Am I missing something here ? __label__5 This problem is trivial to solve. Is this homework ? __label__5 Subjective and argumentative? Really ? __label__5 Please explain why you continue to <url> <url> <url> over the folk magic / Christian revivalist wording in the lede despite the clear consensus against you. You have not gained any favorable comments for your position in the RFC (which in fact is about the treasure seeking sentence you want to add and not about rewording or removing the existing sentence), so on what basis do you claim preeminence for your preferred wording, or for removing the sentences completely ? __label__5 wait! If you ' re doing the thesis, shouldn ' t you be the expert ? __label__5 As you can see from the answers so far, it ' s not quite clear what context we ' re talking about. Could you please clarify ? __label__5 I am sorry but I don ' t see how this is related to uncertainty and time evolution. Could you explain that ? __label__5 Are these whole frozen crab, crab legs, or crab meat? Is it pre - cooked or pasteurized ? __label__5 Why are you putting <nowiki><person></nowiki> on several pages related with Yu - musicians? IMO this is a pretty <strike>stup</strike> meaningless stub to have; why not <nowiki><person></nowiki> instead ? __label__5 Actually, as a bike shop manager, that is exactly my job. What exactly, do you do ? __label__5 Lil - Unique told me it with the reasons of what I put in my edit summary, so if you need a better explanation ask him. I left Billboard Hot 100 as Billboard Hot 100 because that ' s the exact name of the chart ? __label__5 Where is the exception in <url> for "tossing out citations and verifiable in order to make it easier for the reader"? Who are you to disagree with Nikon ' s label of "Compact Professional"?__label__5 You question is very incoherent. Can you ask it more clearly ? __label__5  " given the following program:" I see no program. did you forget to include something ? __label__5 Also, how can the answer be "3"? Three banana ' s ? __label__5  " Not a real question" ? What is the "not real" part here ? __label__5 Emulating how a fish "thinks" is the way to get it really right, worse you can ' t even start on a rough heuristic until you know what a "fish - like swimming path" *looks* like. Do you even have a way to judge how you ' re doing ? __label__5 @Darin Dimotrov: So you ' re saying that if I sent you to the supermarket to get me some beer, you will tell me you can ' t buy beer in a supermarket, while you actually *mean* you don ' t know which brand of beer to buy and whether to buy a single can, a sixpack or a tray. Would ' t it be better to just ask more specifically what I want, instead of telling me it ' s impossible ? __label__5 What? Please speak brighted . Ps . Do you know gag ? __label__5 and what is the problem? why don ' t you use recvfrom - which is the canonical way to read from UDP sockets ? __label__5 Why did you erase the <url> page? I was working on that article, and his notability is not disputed ? __label__5 During your RFA you stated that you would be helping deal with the Scibaby situation after Raul stopped doing it. Do you feel that you ' ve done what you said you were going to do ? __label__5 Six months ago was episode 10, and has peter not been in every episode up to and including that? Seriously, where are you getting your figures ? __label__5 Wait. Unless ''you'' need it repaired and updated quickly ?__label__5 @Kangkan: you ' re getting awfully technical, on a slippery road.. Does the application effectively _knows_? Does the application exist outside of the computer ? __label__5  * What* doesn ' t work? How so, and what do you actually want to do ? __label__5 Doing too many things at once? Not listening ?__label__5 ''<url>''Please also answer the questions at paragraph ''<url>'' above, as you are looking like a classic bully admin who abuses his powers and should be stripped of that role. Is there any review process in wikipedia, for proposing that you be stripped of your admin powers for bullyism ? __label__5 you have been following me around all week reverting my edits. what did i do to you ? __label__5 Regarding <url>, the alumni should be alphabetized and Tom DeLonge did go there. Why would you undo my edit ? __label__5 I did not think that was a refinement. How were those categories not appropriate ? __label__5 original article??__label__5 Oh, be nice. Seven months, surely? :P__label__5 And, no, I don ' t think that everyone who wrote a screenplay should have two pages, but I do think that every artist who has a substantial list of works which would clutter up their biography page should have two pages. Can you explain to me why the two - page thing is such a big deal when wikipedia is not paper ? __label__5 **0% acceptance rate?** Really ? __label__5 just look out or you ' ll regret ! OK, stop here, go to bed. Have U done "Tourism Report" yet ? __label__5 @Praetorian: You had me into tears. I agree to you but is that going to help me with my question ? __label__5 to the Citations missing template. What ' s the deal ? __label__5 Why did you block tanner1996 that is me I was going to choose Nascar1996 but someone else is using that name??__label__5 Seriously? Seriously ? __label__5 someone? anyone ? __label__5 Yea the password isn ' t the same as the lock code and on another note, she needs a better pass code! If you have contacts and pictures synced she could just setup as a fresh phone ? __label__5 I ' m sorry, as this question is written I have no idea what you are actually asking. Can you revise and expand on what you ' d like to know ? __label__5 I don ' t understand. So then you decide by yourself, and the people who stated their support for the original are ignored ? __label__5 @badp I ' ve noticed you often use acronyms that I either need to look up or someone has to have you define for them. Maybe you could consider typing things out instead ? __label__5 But do you think you can take your concerns to the talk page? Crazy notion, eh ? __label__5 Howdy Resolute. Is <url> for real ? __label__5 any code? or do we have to guess at how you did it ? __label__5 That sounds fine, but why would you want somebody who knows nothing about the show to write them? If you are informed about it, wouldn ' t you be a good person to do it ? __label__5 I know it is only after V3, but will there be at least the ability to retrieve the mod flag messages, or a count of the number of moderator flags at some point? Also will you at one point be willing to review the moderator ability features ? __label__5 Why? 99% of the time you can convert well written C code to C++ code by just changing the compiler setting. Why not start using C++ code ? __label__5 You again? Why don ' t you go do your homework ? __label__5 I ' m sure. How about we let the sockpuppet investigation let us know for certain, m ' kay ? __label__5 Don ' t you think that "What do you miss?" kind of questions are subjective ? __label__5 So nearly a year later you change it all again. Why ? __label__5 For me, there ' s a fairly large gap between 'a web map' and a 'web - based GIS': a simple map with layer control and panning is great for many applications, but doing analysis through the web is a different scope which many web maps don ' t attempt to solve. Are you interested in doing analysis or primarily display ? __label__5 Maybe it would be better if we never talked directly to each other ever again. Agreed ? __label__5 @stevenvh 1pm could be the difference between a space craft landing on mars and missing. Oh, sorry - is that one picometer or one picoyard ? __label__5 Vote down? Would you care to explain why ? __label__5 Could you pose a question here? Is the question whether the paper is right ? __label__5 You ' re a troll. Why not go somewhere else ? __label__5 I use the [full - size version](http://training . perl . com / scripts / rename) of the rename script everyday. Why in the world would you *not* want to use existing code ? __label__5 No, Wikipedia does not consider itself (or wikis in general) as a reliable source. Surely you know such a basic policy ? __label__5 You should really use edit summaries to justify your edits. Explain ? __label__5 Say what? And what does this have to do with "Happy New Year" and my pretty picture ? __label__5 Why not? How many colors do you want ? __label__5 So you think it ' s a good idea to dump your homework here without any attempt at solving it from your side and expect us to do your work? Also: which assembler language are we talking about ? __label__5 I understand ''your'' position, however I disagree with it, even regarding the spirit. <ins>Mostly because I don ' t see linking something as modification of the quote, therefore it ' s a moot point, even when coupled with bracketed additions.</ins> Perhaps we should see<ins>k</ins> comments from additional editors ? __label__5 Huh? Is that a web address or a wikilink ? __label__5 I haven ' t. What are you referring to ? __label__5 How would there be a conflict? You ' re not using user supplied filenames for anything, are you ? __label__5 OK, maybe alcohol is depressing my injoke - comprehension circuits, but I can ' t fathom <url> edit summary at all. Care to explain ? __label__5 What kind of edging are you using? quarter round ? __label__5 Delete, who cares. If we ' re going to delete every fair use image that ''has'' a sufficient rationale, why not change to German Wikipedia image policy already ? __label__5 Umm.. isn ' t the template page itself semi - protected? If so, then shouldn ' t it be in the category ? __label__5 Let me ask you this. Assuming we take it that the player might have chosen any door to start with and the host may have opened any unchosen goat - hiding door, why do you not insist that the starting sample space must include all the possible door combinations ? __label__5 Hey EAMann, that ' s great and it works. However, I ' m having trouble echoing the Title, can you put an example of how to do that please ? __label__5 You told me that you couldn ' t access the page in question, although I had recently changed the link to its new location. Maybe you just didn ' t bother to check it out ? __label__5 Visual Studio 2080? Are you from the future? O _ O__label__5 And ? What is the problem ?__label__5 I can ' t think of any reason why this would be necessary. What are you trying to accomplish ? __label__5 So what was the point of that? Are you looking to get blocked ? __label__5 Agreed, show us what you have and seek clarification on the hard parts. You won ' t get far asking people to do your homework for you (how would you learn?)__label__5 What ' s up with all those tweaky changes? Just salting redirects ? __label__5 Re: <url> and <url>, if you think they are better off as redirects to the suburb / town rather than substubs on the lakes with a <nowiki><person></nowiki> tagline, you only need to overwrite the article with a redirect (or revert to a previous version that was a redirect), leaving the substub in the article history. How come you speedied them before redirecting ? __label__5 Don ' t threaten me as that is not vandalism. What is wrong with a nude photo of Barack ' s mom ? __label__5 What part of "use common sense" did not get through to you? Was it the "use," the "common," the "sense," or some combination thereafter ? __label__5 To clarify, are you asking "pros and cons.. of using SSL?" or ".. using SSL for the WHOLE site as opposed to just login page" or something like that ? __label__5 No, of course I never did. So why do you keep writing about "scorning others ' s sensitivities" when such a thing was never suggested ? __label__5 Yeesh. Is it just me, or is it very difficult to follow these "stream of consciousness" postings ? __label__5 What ' s going on? Why did you revert my edits to those articles without any explanation ? __label__5 I ' m curious as to why you chose to <url> a full two minutes after my last comment? Am I to take this as a sign you are no longer willing to discuss the issue ? __label__5 Not at all clear what you want to do. What is the full expected output ? __label__5 I replied to you <url> but you didn ' t answer. Did you not see it ? __label__5 Are you kidding me? Do you even bother to click on <url> to see its fleet ? __label__5 This same question was asked almost word - for - word about two hours ago. Hasn ' t anyone ever heard of Google ? __label__5 Hi, You stated the editor is inactive, yet the editor is stalking me through MY CONTRIBUTIONS and reverting my entries and the editor left a message on the top of my TALK page, so why would you not block them ? You didn ' t even give them a warning ?__label__5 I ' m not sure how I feel about you adding coordinates to locations all over the place, but rather than get into that, let ' s start with something easy: "<url>" does not equal "<url>". Do you need me to explain why, or was that just a typo ? __label__5 Corrections, make that four terms: I pick a car and swap, I pick a goat and swap, I pick a car and do not swap, I pick a goat and do not swap. Who cares about doors or door numbers ? __label__5 Title say permutations, but body says combinations. Which is it ? __label__5 That you would consider a section that he "praised" a murderer (referenced to a website dedicated to smear campaigns, no less) as "NPOV" is astonishing. Doesn ' t <url> apply here or do you expect other users to turn the attack into something NPOV ? __label__5 will u please rephrase the question? what do you want to do really ? __label__5 @Jason: You ' re a harsh man. Millions of people also disagree it seems - go watch the show ? __label__5 My answer would be: What kind of lame ass product searches for palindromes in a string. May I take a closer look at your business plan, please ? __label__5 ? EXPLAIN PLEASE! WHERE WOULD I DO THAT @ ?__label__5 I consider <url> to be the single most important edit I have ever made. God, what is happening with The Beatles coverage on Wikipedia ? __label__5 Please post the relevant lines from the log. Do you intend for these commands to run as you, or as root ? __label__5 Well, look again! Does ''<url>'' look like a dictionary - definition page to you ? __label__5 Please tell me when it turned out that Mach principle is wrong? And how this "wrongness" is manifested ? __label__5  _ Why_ are you trying to delay it? What do you expect to gain from that ? __label__5 Why not try adding sources from time to time? If you won ' t who do you expect to do so ? __label__5 If people want to know more about her, there ' s the article on her. Are you really meaning to argue that people could not fully understand the concept of imagism without seeing a picture of HD ? __label__5 I don ' t understand why did you add that message at the bottom of this page??__label__5 The image is only used on ONE page - the site of the film. What is the problem here, and how does it violate wikipedia policy ? __label__5 Why are you using exec? And what ' s wrong with passing in a string or file ? __label__5 The policy is quite clear; userids set up for the purposes of harassment or vandalism are blocked indefinitely. That said, what policy is it that you think I ' m not following ? __label__5 ''You wrote:'' I ' m not trying to be obtuse, but is what you ' re saying in essence that if we cannot tell whether an award is utterly trivial then that uncertainty becomes sufficient assertion of notability to not apply A7? So if an assumption needs to be made, or discretion employed, A7 doesn ' t apply because the assertion of notability has been made ? __label__5 SE, I ' ve briefly blocked your bot because I see it ' s changing embedded links to footnotes again, against <url>. Did you discuss with anyone that you were doing this, or get permission to use it ? __label__5 PS, I would seriously like an answer to my question above. What is your native language and where do you come from ? __label__5 Lowell / Lawrence Blvd leading from Lowell to the Methuen Rotary is a device from hell as well. How many people does that short stretch of road have to kill ? __label__5 Come on Mohrflies, I donxb4t understand why you insist in these edits: <url>? Why "Yugoslav" when absolutely no one uses it ? __label__5 I have to protest that I find it rather meaningless to present arguments on the talk page for edits which are then blankly reverted by the likes of User : Historicar without explanation or discussion. Any suggestions for a more formal process or other remedies ? __label__5 REVERT??__label__5 Why keeps everone calling Java **methods** *functions*? Is that what they ' re teached at schools nowadays ? __label__5 Alf has a large <url> in Germany. How on earth do you know that he is a character "almost no one knows about" Where you get your f ' n info ? __label__5 the edit just made things less clear! how does one reorder a list A to another list B when the elements may be different?!__label__5 What, you are saying that nothing published at mises . org is a reliable source? What is your basis for asserting that ? __label__5  - 1 Why put "Urgent" in the title? Is your time more important than others ? __label__5 I am curious why this is an interesting question. Why would you care, as long as it ' s not leaky ? __label__5 <url> - "Even if he makes only a single administrative action then his having the tools is a net positive." - a single admin action> are you joking? he gets to see all the deleted data forever access to the extra buttons forever and you consider a single action as a net positive ? __label__5 Agree. Who the hell came up with that in the first place ? __label__5 Also, why are you calling "use Inline" three times? Where did you get the idea to do this, and why not just call it once ? __label__5 ??__label__5 Most of the editors who would care about the deletion of KiK ' s threads are the ones who would agree with him, so it ' s pointless to warn them. Hell .. come to think of it, hasn ' t KiK been all over their talk pages, with them high - fiving each other ? __label__5 You could specify whether you need an introduction on applied statistics, or one on (theoretical) statistical inference. I . e., do you want the framework of testing, regression and ANOVA explained or do you want to know what the central limit theorem and the inequality of Chebiyshev have to do with the weak law of large numbers ? __label__5 Sorry, I wasn ' t sure as you said you ' d upgraded from 10 . 10, so I didn ' t know how 'fresh' your install was. Are you using nouveau or the proprietary drivers ? __label__5 There already a bunch of free IDE out there, and you want to use Visual Studio ?? You have arguments to not use Eclipse or Netbeans ?__label__5 homework? perchance ? __label__5 Which views version are you using? Are you using the views - 7 . x - 3 . x - dev with the new UI ? __label__5 From your responses, it looks like you ' ve made up your mind to do this despite all the people telling you not to. Why did you ask the question if you don ' t plan to understand / listen to advice ? __label__5 I don ' t see anything strange in the log you posted. What do you expect `NSTokenField` to do??__label__5 How come no one will answer this question!??__label__5 Why the vote to close? Is this offensive to you ? __label__5 A remarkably modern - sounding name for something being applied to articles on people who ' ve been dead for centuries. You really think it ' s appropriate for <url> ?__label__5 On a more practical note: One either does or doesn ' t agree to take part in mediation. Which is it, please ? __label__5 To what extent do you want: (a) mathematical rigour; (b) applications in particular software (e . g., R, SPSS, SAS, etc.); (c) domain - specific applications ? __label__5 What, my dear, will change the fact of your poor anargumentative technique??__label__5 So it ' s not really about the list, it ' s about those instructions? What exactly is the question then ? __label__5 Firstly, why do you assume I don ' t care about the content, and secondly, what chance have you given anyone to voice a dissenting opinion? Correct me if I am wrong, but you don ' t seem to have asked if anyone had a problem with the merge, did you ? __label__5 I just have to ask. Why is that outside? And why don ' t you reroute it inside (the way it probably should be)?__label__5 Again, what would be the point of redirection? Who on earth is going to fall on the redirect first ? __label__5 Any more of this hoax crap at <url>, <url>, Eyre / Heller garbage, and you will be ''permanently'' banned from editing. Is that clear ? __label__5 Also, when you look at the logs, are the calls to the server become less frequent? Is it possible you have a loop or call that gets slower over time ? __label__5 You ask and answer your own question? Or am I completely missing out on something ? __label__5 @Michael: What purpose does this serve besides being a list of milk? If it ' s just a list of milk, is that really useful ? __label__5 @Georg: Yes. Did you read my comments ? __label__5 Sergio, can you please clarify? Do you mean "a wave or a particle"?__label__5 Your algorithm is already converting it to coordinates in mercator coordinate system. What is your question ? __label__5 Sorry, almost forgot. After calling me a "child" "uneducated" and making remarks to the effect of "shouldn ' t be allowed to post on edit Wikipedia" what grounds have you got to stand on to say I ' ve made personal attacks against you by suggesting vandalism ? __label__5 Is <url> what you ' re referring to?? ''One'' autograph page that he deleted almost ''five months'' ago and you ' re now attacking him as if he deleted every single autograph book ever ? __label__5 Um, what? So presumably you ' d like to change "Irish footballer and manager" to "Republic of Ireland - born association footballer and coach (sports).."?__label__5 So you exchanged my suggestion with an ''expired'' nomination.. Right ? __label__5 no, not funny, unless you are a mentally challenged person. Why don ' t you find a better hobby where you don ' t post lies and offend the people of Tibet ? __label__5 Look dude, <url> was ALSO just deleted. What makes 2005 so special ? __label__5 You really want off here, dont you? I ' ve already posted the incident on the incident board and you still are keeping it up ? __label__5 See <url> - not a good revert, and no reason given. Rollback ? __label__5 To whom are you referring, Hipicrite? Who has a "secret opinion"?__label__5 Why did using VirtualBox not work? Did you set up the networking correctly (adding a host - only adapter to the VM)?__label__5 Wow, you have a lot of gall, given you removed the West Wing discussion from your Talk Page with the edit summary "Archiving crap". Perhaps if your going to make unnecessary comments on people ' s talk pages, you should hold yourself to the same standard ? __label__5 I hardly ever agree with Jimintheatl, but that block was bordering on absurd. Fast on the button much ? __label__5 So you reverted my edit, rstoring a badly written sentence that includes a point that is neither germane to the topic nor supported by a citation. Yeah, that really helped, didn ' t it ? __label__5 @torbengb: Good point. Looking at this site ' s [Area 51 entry](http://area51 . stackexchange . com / proposals / 151 ? phase=commitment), something very similar is listed as definitely off - topic ("What ' s Apple going to release in the next generation iPad?").__label__5 <url> and <url> seem to be two articles on the same subject. What ' s the point of having separate articles ? __label__5 Homework? Because there doesn ' t seem to be any other remote possibility in my mind why any sane person would want to do this ? __label__5 That ' s a lot of complicated code for something which could probably be shown a lot more simply. Care to provide a much simpler example.. and an actual *question* to go with it ? __label__5 Seems like a rather big project. From what I can read, you have no experience in programming ? __label__5 I see you figured out how to ask questions. Why not earn a badge and go back and delete your "non - answer" to the TAOCP question ? __label__5 Seems like <url> has conveniently "quit" the wiki all of a sudden. That wasn ' t one of ''your'' sockpuppets, was it ? __label__5 I don ' t understand why Hong is so reluctant to revert unilateral changes from time - to - time when he did so frequently in the past when I or someone else who supported my edits did it. What exactly is the point in me agreeing to this if someone conveniently comes along and then starts making lots of changes that I don ' t like but Giovanni doesn ' t mind ? __label__5 Please don ' t talk like a robot. What harm did it do ? __label__5 @Thomas P: hahah!! apropos Dijkstra huh?!__label__5 @IVlad: yup, but the current answers fail to explain why. Care to write a better one ? __label__5 That incident is already mentioned in the <url>. Why do you insist on redundantly adding it ? __label__5 Really? What is the evidence that leads you to conclude that `';'` is interpreted as a sentence terminator ? __label__5 Hello? You going to answer this ? __label__5 Look even your 3rr message says to use the talk page. What authority does the Pokemon project have over Japanese mythology ? __label__5 That the requirements are wrong? (and the code right?)__label__5 yes, but we are hardly debating that edit that hasnt stood in the last few days anywway and certainly isnt an issue right now. What of that edit do you currently object to with such vehemence ? __label__5 What exactly do you want to interpolate? What is the resolution and distribution of your measurement points ? __label__5 Wow! How has no one recommended SharePoint? Or is that telling in itself ? __label__5 Wow, you waited a whole ten minutes. What ' s the problem ? __label__5 They did and have done, on my talk page and on their talk page and most the time im not really doing anything and i always seem to get the finger pointed at me. So what do you expect me to do if someone is uncivil towards me ? __label__5 I think the question that is most looming on my mind is.. what could possibly be the purpose of decrementing an auto increment id from mysql? Have you considered that maybe what you are trying to do is just not good ? __label__5 Is it your view that the United States Senate doesn ' t have "any credibility"? Or are you of the view that some cyber truck that zooms around the WW must have bumped into the web page by "accident" and dumped stuff endorsed the United States government ? __label__5 wait.. what? Since there ' s only one actual neutral connection coming into the box, that one has to somehow connect to all five lamps, doesn ' t it ? __label__5 Saranyya: what task are you trying to accomplish? why do you need to sleep with such precision ? __label__5 Can I also point out that the text that you pasted into Wikipedia is entirely inappropriate for an encyclopedia article and at best will require extensive editing to conform to the<url>. Are you going to do that editing, or are you going to leave it to one of the other 'lazy' people who edit this encyclopedia ? __label__5 Just to be a bit of a stinker: your title isn ' t really a question, nor is it a good indicator of what you ' re actually asking. Consider revising ? __label__5 you will certainly find something on the spec. Have you tried ? __label__5 There is still ambiguity - `1 3 5 4 2` is zig zag according to YOUR description of the problem, but NOT according to the topcoder description. Do you see why ? __label__5 Sorry Olin, I ' m very much a noob who ' s running before I can walk. What do you mean by latch up and why should there be continuity ? __label__5 While this may not be your homework, you are essentially just asking us to write you code to solve this problem. Maybe you should do a Google search ? __label__5 You call what I did wikistalking yet these editors are allowed to do the same thing to me? Where ' s the sense in that ? __label__5 Depends; do you care deeply about image policy? Or are you an incurable masochist ? __label__5 @Paul: The list of operands you can use inside a predicate does not include "and", but you ' re using the comma as if it were an "and". Should we consider "and" to be allowable in the definition of a predicate ? __label__5 Yeah. What ' s the point of reverting them again if they ' ll be removed, anyway ? __label__5 Anyway, the point is that the bot is editing against <url>. Can you let me know whether you intend to continue or whether we can agree that you ' ll stop using it to do this ? __label__5 Um , oops.. sorry for editing your question; thought I was editing an answer. Want me to pull that down into a comment ? __label__5 This sounds like a job for the listings package, really. Could you post an example of your code ? __label__5  " I wonder why downloading on Windows mangled the mp3?" uhh, because it ' s a toy - like excuse for a real operating system ? __label__5 Then maybe admins should focus on copyright infringements and avoid the leader / educator / cop / parliamentarian roles that they cherish so much. Could 100 admins handle this ? __label__5 Clues? Any code??__label__5 As for restoring the image, no I will not. Did you consider that you are asking me to put up an image for which I know the "fair use" claim to be bogus, and that this is illegal ? __label__5 Again, why are you simply reverting wholesale and without any explanation? Would you rather the article be out of line with the policies and guidelines, among other problems ? __label__5 So what have you found so far? Or should we do all of your homework ? __label__5 Phones generally don ' t even ring for more than 30 seconds. Why do you want to do this ? __label__5 sorry nothing related to the original question, but do you know anything about the australian electricity market? Seams quite stable, especially with all their coal easily available ? __label__5 On <url> about the Chinese sex imbalance, you accused either the OP or the first responder (me) of <url>. Could you explain why you thought either of us was advocating, opining, or recruiting, in a way that diminished the quality of the reference desk ? __label__5 What ' s wrong with PowerShell? http://technet . microsoft . com / en - us / scriptcenter / powershell . aspx Why aren ' t you using this ? __label__5 Why would this be homework? And what if it was homework ? __label__5 what a hypocrite! Doesn ' t his solution (steps 3 - 5) also apply for both of his statements ? __label__5 No this is security. (what would server fault have to do with injection?)__label__5 How about this for a novel solution? The next time a banned editor posts something to your page, why not delete it yourself with an edit summary of "Sorry, I ' m topic - banned from discussing this"?__label__5 The output you give doesn ' t tie in at all clearly with the inputs in the second case. What are you really after ? __label__5 You may want to look at the nomination. What did you intend to do ? __label__5 You have a lot of cheek marking <url> with <person> without actually taking the trouble to say what needs fixing. If you ' re really someone who is able to contribute with a "professional" level of English, why not display this supposed proficiency rather than engaging in the illiterate practice of adding templates with tools ? __label__5 ok your 1 step closer to getting help. Now what exactly is _NOT working_?__label__5 Misrepresenting a person ' s actions to portray them in a bad light is one of the more common (and transparent) forms of personal attack. Is that your defense for repeatedly violating <url>?__label__5 Are you using cheesecloth, and worried because the finer particles get through and settle out? Or are you just running it through a sieve and seeing small cracklings still floating in it..?__label__5 Rather than tell me how wrong I was to close certain afd ' s maybe your time would be better spent dealing with the current afd backlog <url>. If my decisions were so wrong why haven ' t you re - opened them ? __label__5 @user393043, is it that you ' ve consulted the documentation and are still confused? Or that you haven ' t even looked at the docs in the first place ? __label__5 You do realize this is an example? And that Ruby find this problem at RUNTIME ? __label__5 What error? We should guess ? __label__5 In general, in questions like this it would be very useful to specify what kind of thesis you are supposed to write: For example, BSc, MSc, PhD, something else? In particular, are you expected to do new research or "just" organise existing knowledge ? __label__5 Could you cite a reference please? Is the rule based on the noun closest to the verb ? __label__5 Since you are STILL not responding to me (or the talk page discussion) and reverting anyway, I have mad you a <url> template. Post THAT on your page and leave the regular one alone, OK ? __label__5 I ' m usually polite, but this one seemed to need a slap across the face. It ' s .. words escape me .. mindboggling.. jaw - dropping .. ?__label__5 Shouldn ' t these be called 'dairy substitutes'? Or 'Substitutes for dairy?'__label__5 Your poorly written, bizarre comment makes no sense, since all of my edits in the Al Franken article conform to wikipedia ' s NPOV policy. What are you talking about ? __label__5 pardon my ignorance, but what is a "game matchmaking service"? Is it like eHarmony for avatars ? __label__5 There was a redirect from KLPN to KTPN that was created. KLPN is the main station so why is the article called KTPN ? __label__5 What kind of user knows JSON but not HTML? How would you put bold text in a link ? __label__5 You do `global $post`, but at the time `content _ save _ pre` runs, no `$post` object exists (since you are right before saving it). Could this be your problem ? __label__5 CW, you are aware that Lebanon isn ' t Hezbollah, right? In the same way that Ireland isn ' t the IRA ? __label__5 Why did you delete see also section in Puerto Rico? why did you delete the political parties ? __label__5 I don ' t understand. If you had your problem solved .. why did you post a question ? __label__5 I ' m being a bit thick but what exactly is the problem..Are you getting an exception? is so what ? __label__5 Mind <url>. Since when one edit after protection expiry is disruptive editing or editwarring ? __label__5 I ' ve re - read the question at least 4x ' s now and am still confused, re: if your manager has great faith in your development skills, why isn ' t your manager giving you senior - level responsibilities? Or is it just the title you are seeking ? __label__5 lol, WHAT? sry not making fun of anyone but this is hilarious the way it is asked ? __label__5 I don ' t see how you can use this to discount his trustworthiness and oppose him. If there is consensus to promote among several bureaucrats, what ' s it matter who actually presses the button ? __label__5 @belisarius done. clear now ? __label__5 You have reverted four times, Sarek three times, and an IP once. Do I take it that you are declining to undo your edit ? __label__5 Hi, I noticed you blocked ''BPRD Agent'' with no expiry time with reason: ''Vandalism - only account; see contribs and deleted contribs''. Um, isn ' t the Deleted Contributions only restricted to administrators ? __label__5 Those sound more like rhetorical questions than actual questions. What are you looking for ? __label__5 What benefit will you gain if we do your homework for you? Why don ' t you do it yourself ? __label__5  " think I ' ve pointed out something that is not yet satisfactorily proven"? What have you pointed out that ' s not proven formally ? __label__5 No worries dude, we ' re all here to learn :) Yeah you ' ll most likely need to set your normals. Have you just tried darkening the colour from white to a grey and see if that shows it slightly better ? __label__5 Why have you included the Putnam Line in the MTA infobox, when it was never operated by the MTA (excepting the Marble Hill stub, which is hardly on a par with the Hudson Line, Harlem Line, etc.)?__label__5 But ''you ' re'' the one branding his work as anti - Semitic! See what I mean about bad faith ? __label__5 I ' ve just reinstated the perfectly valid redirect to this. I seem to remember there was some issue years ago with a rock group of the same name, but don ' t you look at these things before you delete ? __label__5 What? No warning that gender can change ? __label__5 2 . 5D? Is that what people call projected 3D nowadays ? __label__5 I don ' t get it. You have the `query` object already, so why not just do `if (query . id && query . foo && query . bar) { .. }`?__label__5 According to the error message the second line of the file `/etc / apt / sources . list` is invalid. Could you please post that line ? __label__5 Hi, Matt. Aren ' t you supposed to be banned ? __label__5 I don ' t really see that as a problem. If it ' s a fringe position why not simply state it as such ? __label__5 This is subjective / asking for a list of things. Can you make this a CW ? __label__5 I am curious why you want to do it in *TeX. What is missing in the various other solutions that use an external language ? __label__5 As it is currently worded, this question is pretty broad. Could you provide more specific information about what kind of portrait shots you are hoping to take ? __label__5 Unless you ' re building an ORM yourself, this is a strange question to ask. What exactly are you trying to do ? __label__5  " Please explain in detail"? Really ? __label__5  " It ' s my own program " - then, presumably you have the source code. Debug that ? __label__5 Yeah, but playtime is over. Find some articles to edit, yes ? __label__5 What do you mean by protecting them? What are you trying to prevent / avoid ? __label__5 I suggest re - titling the question, as this has nothing to do with ebay. Perhaps a title like "How can I secure my PHP website?".__label__5 I think you might be missing the point of the assignment. Hint: what can regular expressions parse, what can ' t they ? __label__5 Thanks for the referrence. Do you have any other response to the Bozo who doubts notability ? __label__5 Could you tell which packages you have already tried? Would something like a long table, where you type each paragraph into a cell, be useful to you ? __label__5 Firstly who are you? Secondly there seems to be a lot more people involved than just Node ue thirdly I don ' t care what his view is as long as his edits are neutral, which edits do you dispute ? __label__5 So I got rid of it. Have a little faith in my good judgment, okay ? __label__5 Ah, I agree that "comes with" is misleading. But the remote administration client binary (to which I assumed he was referring) isn ' t called Remote Desktop ? __label__5 How are you going to power this? If it ' s off of batteries, how long would you want it to last ? __label__5 Did you try anything at all? Is this homework ? __label__5 You mean like any one of the numerous ggplot2 example charts such as [this](http://learnr . wordpress . com / 2009 / 05 / 18 / ggplot2 - three - variable - time - series - panel - chart/) or did you have something more specific in mind ? __label__5 That ' s the British English spelling. American English wins out on a lot of stuff on Wikipedia, so why not give a cookie to the Brits now and then ? __label__5 What the hell? Bitter much ? __label__5 This seems OT? @LBushkin, do you think this would be the right site for this kind of question ? __label__5  - why- not use sorting? homework ? __label__5 You ' ve completely lost me. What are you asking about ? __label__5 sounds suspiciously like homework. if it is, what have you done to solve the problem yourself ? __label__5 I don ' t see any mention of Wikipedia in that article. Don ' t you have other things you could be worrying about ? __label__5 Under "normal" circumstances, that space shouldn ' t be there, unless explicitly added. Can you please add to your question a [minimal working example](http://ww . minimalbeispiel . de / mini - en . html) illustrating how your footnotes generate the extra spacing ? __label__5 Your question, as it stands, is difficult to understand. What do you mean by "referred to" ?__label__5 Why not use a database such as MySQL? And more disturbing is why didn ' t anyone mention that ?!?!__label__5  " Oh, that", eh? So, you ''wrongly accused me of making death threats'', and that ' s all you have to say for yourself ? __label__5  * lol* the war against crackers is stopping our white - hats to learn the trade. Maybe the criminals will go away when we don ' t know how they do it? ;)__label__5 Very well I won ' t contact you anymore. Geez, whatever happen to the spirit of collaboration ? __label__5 I asked "A or B?", and you said "Yes"..?__label__5  ( after multipled edit conflicts ) I checked your behaviour and your contributions myself at the time, as did numerous other admins who reviewed your edits and the block and it was subject of extensive discussion on and off - site so your suggestion that I should have checked with others is silly. You violated Wikipedia ' s policies and were blocked rightly for it; you ' ve been given a second chance and instead of being productive you come here to moan about a comment I made more than six months ago, that I still stand by, and to pursue your now year - old vendetta against Nick ? __label__5 You deleted Ricardo Marinello. What was written in the article ? __label__5 "''Images with iconic status or historical importance: As subjects of commentary.''". Listen, it ' s just trivial to look up, could you take the care of actually reading these policies before arguing over them ? __label__5 Do you mean iTunes and is the metadata just in the files ( e . g. mp3s) or in some other sytem ? __label__5  ( Constantine and Leo are English, not Latin names.) Why don ' t you answer my question about Constantine the Great ? __label__5 BTW, nobody else has been keeping that page updated as much as I have worked on it for the entire hockey year, and it would be dead and empty without my work. So, why don ' t you be positive and praise my work instead of being so picky on such a minor, insignificant thing as putting 'vacant' on - top instead of below a player who no longer is on the team ? __label__5 @Monish If you don ' t know how to implement modes of operation, you shouldn ' t be implementing your own crypto code. Why not use an existing library, like KeyCzar ? __label__5 There. Better ? __label__5 Do you mean multiple categories of blogs? Or multiple discrete blogs like CNN ' s blog site ? __label__5 To answer the second part of your question, you would have to define what you mean by "cook". What exactly are you doing to cook them ? __label__5 You think mapping strings to a variable ' s symbolic name is a good idea? Why in the world would you think that ? __label__5 Who??__label__5 How about some code? Otherwise, how can we tell what you ' re doing with the image?!__label__5 The review has been up there for something like six weeks, I notice. Think you ' ll be able to take care of those last couple of things ? __label__5 Are you really denying that you brought Giano and Bishonen ' s names into this? Seriously ? __label__5 Not a clue what you ' re talking about. Is PhotoshopImage a private class you ' ve created or what ? __label__5 I am attempting to ask what I see as a fundamental question. Maybe I should have asked, "is it true that there is a fundamental computational complexity for certain math that cannot be avoided?"__label__5 It ' s not my job to add the "Bronze Age" material in the article on <url>, so please refrain from removing existing material just because you haven ' t made any effort to add the "Bronze Age" content. OK ?__label__5 ..is indeed a sick and boring life. Where do I sign up to give you your celebratory sexin'?__label__5 Evidently, I don ' t have enough consciousness, because I haven ' t the foggiest idea of what you ' re talking about. Could you tell me ? __label__5 Aren ' t those that you listed sufficient? What are you looking for ? __label__5 What you can ' t understand? Binary search at all or just authors description ? __label__5 Yeah I have. Yes I know that; you saying I ' m a malicious admin ? __label__5 Why do you need to store the whole graph in memory? Can ' t you serialize it to the datastore in a fashion that makes querying it practical ? __label__5 The file clearly states this is an image from a poster. Since when does this require any additional explanation ? __label__5 Maybe others haven ' t noticed - or are too busy. If you are thinking what I ' m thinking, why am I reverting so many of your edits ? __label__5 Stole ur flag for my page. that ok ? __label__5 So you ' re interested in both Amiga computers and BDSM! Are you an atheist too ? __label__5 No kidding. Perhaps you could be troubled to point out the parts you consider to be actionable as 'spam'?__label__5 You should change the title to a question. Maybe something like "What is the most popular Dictionary Application for Ubuntu?"__label__5 ..have you considered implementing it yourself? You *are* a programmer, aren ' t you ? __label__5 Vandalism is putting a live AFD template back? You ' re a smart one ain ' t you ? __label__5 Aren ' t answers from Kev and papin totally opposite? So what ' s the truth ? __label__5 @BioBuckyBall: Do you read what I wrote? Do you read every word ? __label__5 It is an obvious and strongly followed point that april fools jokes ''should not disrupt the running of the wiki''. Could you explain why the HELLS you coated a dozen users' pages with pictures of jimbo ' s ugly bearded fizzogg ? __label__5 What have you tried and where are you stuck? Or are you just asking *us* to do *your* work for you ? __label__5 Tom, that article is ready for publication, was written by someone else, and your changes aren ' t improving it. Did MER - C ask you to work on it ? __label__5 Sorry @klox I don ' t understand. Could you explain a bit more ? __label__5 Don ' t push it, Zachary. Can you give me proof of the existence of "MusicMaximum Hot 100"?__label__5 What exactly do you want to know? Equipment tips, location tips, landscape photography tips ? __label__5 do you know any good references for the special cases of nonexistence that you mentioned? Or perhaps, just a general reference / set of references for the order 12 case ? __label__5 I gave a working answer, just scroll down to read it. Who is going to accept my answer ? __label__5 Why did everyone list universities? Aren ' t there any other types of infosec policies ? __label__5 You still haven ' t answered my question: ''why did you delete the article so quickly'', without even bothering to read it? And why are you so willing to back Thunderbunny and not me ? __label__5 Why are you using that in the first place? Why not `boost::posix _ time::microsec _ clock::local _ time()`?__label__5 @Dino beytar, if you provided some more details about the purpose of this data, you might be able to get some suggestions on how to best handle it. I assume you are aggregating this data on your origin server ? __label__5 I don ' t understand your example, but I ' m also not a new user. How about some examples of shortcuts / commands you haven ' t been able to come up with a mnemonic for yet ? __label__5 Can you explain what you are trying to do? The *whole point* of the Null Object Refactoring is *not* to use `nil`, so why would you want to inherit from `NilClass` for that ? __label__5 did these suggestions help you? Are you able to accept an answer ? __label__5 Do I get a reference to my comment? Show me where I refuse to provide evidence backing up my changes ? __label__5 whats the question? and why isn ' t this tagged as homework ? __label__5 Refresh bug? Failure to update dynamic status ? __label__5 Does it not take just a bit more than someone saying they own it to remove a copyvio? As can be seen I post from Canada and what ' s to stop me claiming to be <url> and anything published in the <url> can be put on Wikipedia (or something a little more sensible)?__label__5 @Andrew Bolster: "listofthings in the actual implementation is coming from the parent". Why can ' t you make this `thing` method a part of the parent and simplify this design ? __label__5 Your edit makes parsenome ' s answer seem redundant. A bit unfair, no ? __label__5 Am I indeed "dishonest" by responding to you? Is <url> correct ? __label__5 So, basically, you ' re just violating <url> and <url>. Why ? __label__5 OK, so a website might not be reliable even if its sources are (despite the convenience in showing both on wikipedia for guidance, as mere reading material). But what you failed to explain is.. WHY IS THIS PARTICULAR AND UNMENTIONED BY THE RULES WEBSITE UNRELIABLE ? __label__5 Unless I was forcing a developer to work in an unfamiliar language, not only would I not pay for their IDE I wouldn ' t hire them if they didn ' t have it already. You going to charge them for your time to install and configure it ? __label__5 SudoGhost, just a question. Do you think that simply calling someone ' s edits disruptive is very specific ? __label__5 No, it is not needed. You know a penalty box was made for the kind of behavior you ' re exhibiting right now ? __label__5 So use a merge sort. And the question is ? __label__5 I saw that you have a great answer from DisgruntledGoat. Did he not answer your question fully ? __label__5  " Cant see the error" ? You mean your compiler crashes as badly on this code that you even can ' t tell us what he is complaining about ? __label__5 I ' m disappointed that your first response here was to revert me without discussion, and to assert a consensus that was not apparent. Before you choose to revert me again, can you ''please'' participate in the discussion at WT : RD ? __label__5 Sorry. But, what is "Sym" button ? __label__5 Um, why are you doing this with Javascript? Is that really going to be the way to put things into the database ? __label__5 I don ' t get it. Are you asking us to try and predict the future ? __label__5 thanx 4 answering my question.. i already tried ice, but after 9 degree C, LCD went off . so i didn ' t go 4 boil water but used soldering iron 2 show dat ckt is working. can u please tell me hw can i check temp of liquids like water with this ic ? __label__5 Apple => i = 0 => B [ i + 101] = B [ 101] = "0069", not "0041". Am I wrong or are you ? __label__5 Any reason for not using `print join '+', 1..3`? I mean it ' s golf, right ? __label__5 *"Use a JavaScript literal."* Huh ? __label__5 Is there a reason why all of you on here seem to be anti - car? I would find this amusing, but highly inappropriate behavior from our mayor in Seattle. Why is it something to laud here ? __label__5 Your title says "sorted array", but you ask about a BST in your question? Is this homework ? __label__5 *"There ' s this funny gap I tried to write a paper once upon a time when I studied linguistics…"* — I think there ' s an "on" or "upon" missing. :-) You probably meant "…I tried to write a paper on once upon a time"?__label__5 An empty inbox? What ' s that ? __label__5 You ' re still missing the point. How do the two sites meet <url>?__label__5 Can I get some time to finish what I am doing without everything being deleted??__label__5 So what exactly was the point in moving 'Birmingham New Street Station' to 'Birmingham New Street railway station' I ' ve never heard it called that before nor any other of the Birmingham stations. Is there any need to add 'railway' to the title of a station unless it is being disambiguated from a bus station or something ? __label__5 what? .. Also why you need to this via Array and not via DB ? __label__5 I am an administrator on this project and my task is to enforce these rules. Now, will you cooperate or will I have to block you ? __label__5 That ' s what groups are for. http://docs . djangoproject . com / en / 1 . 3 / topics / auth/#groups Why aren ' t you using groups ? __label__5 Sorry what has blender to do with game engines? do you want to use its format ? __label__5 Comply with what your talk page says, get off and study!! Have you willpower ? __label__5 Can you please edit this question to make it more constructive? How many of the 6 guidelines does it satisfy ? __label__5 @Joel, I don ' t have this problem here either (Android 2 . 2 on HTC EVO). Is it simply remembering a previous URL ? __label__5 I ' m a little surprised you haven ' t responded to my suggestions regarding the GAN yet. Is there some sort of a problem there, or have you just not managed to get around to it yet ? __label__5 WTF? Downvotes? What for ? __label__5 4 . 5 million hits on Google turning up the non - Columbia campuses. What are you talking about ? __label__5 Um - no. And I take it you delieve all racist and fascist groups are "right wing"?__label__5  " Bike tires don ' t need tread to handle rain." Excuse me? Since when ? __label__5 Testing is an art more than a science. Before you go off and read a book, tell me - what are you trying to accomplish ? __label__5 Except here is where the action took place, so here is where I questioned it. How about you answer it ? __label__5 Why delete the page <url> with no explanation, as an act of deliberate vandalism? Why did you do it ? __label__5 Blocking people who disagree with your edits is a very zionist approach. Why don ' t you try instead to justify why your material should stay in the lead ? __label__5 It ' s about freedom of speech and no Islamic terrorism is going to deter the truth from outing. And if it ' s forbidden to look at figures of Mohammed how come you did it; are you going to hell ? __label__5 What does the tarball contain? I assume it is the content you want to compile, not the tarball itself ? __label__5 Also, you say you are looking for a tool but it sounds like you are looking for an image format. Do you have a list of allowable formats ? __label__5 He has been indef blocked once again. I wonder how long it will take him to come back this time ? __label__5 Surely your classes have at least introduced basic entity relationship modelling to you already? I can ' t see them giving you this project without some kind of basic coursework.. Are you sure this isn ' t a case of just skipping read the textbook / lecture notes ? __label__5 Most of those differences would be identified by a grammar book as differences between British and American varieties of English. How about past participles like "proved" versus "proven" or "got" versus "gotten"?__label__5 That doesn ' t really make any sense. You have an array of dictionary objects or you actually have a dictionary whose values are all of this object type with keys like Title etc ? __label__5 Maybe if you could let us know *why* you want to do this. Just for kicks ? __label__5 To suggest an answer we need to know which application you want to open this file in. Is it a command line application (aka vi or emacs on the command line) or is it another text editor (TextEdit, TextMate, Eclipse?)__label__5 since when was north 0 degrees, east 45 degress etc. Don ' t you mean 0, 90, 180, 270 ? __label__5 Out of curiosity what are you actually trying to accomplish? To put it another way, _why_ do you want to do this ? __label__5 You are being very insulting on <url>. Can ' t you just trust the strength of your arguments, instead of insulting people who are doing their best to help improve Wikipedia ? __label__5 And what operating system? and why on earth are you writing this in assembler ? __label__5 Your bot has ruined the formatting on ref 2 in <url>. Would you care to either call off the bot or suggest an alternate formatting that will work better ? __label__5 Being too efficient can be detrimental - what if I was doing it in the wrong order - does that allow my reversion if indeed I do utilise the abbreviation? A simple enquiry might have been in order ? __label__5 @Ranieri, what would you suggest? JSON ? __label__5 Okay, I will fix the "crystals", but how do I put myself up for adoption again? Will you kindergarten <url> me through the process ? __label__5 the singular of hierarchies is hierarchy, btw. can you edit that ?__label__5 You wouldn ' t be allowed to ask and post comments if you were not logged in. What kind of programmer are you ? __label__5 Fine, but you didn ' t need to be an admin to make edits to articles. Or did you ? __label__5 Why can ' t we do like IMDB and have multiple ratings? Is it that simple, or am I crazy ? __label__5 Would you like to elaborate? How are you empowering me exactly ? __label__5 You seem to have plenty of time to discuss, why don ' t you try to educate <url> ? Maybe he needs this more than me ?__label__5 If you don ' t agree with this approach, you can ether add the references yourself, or delete the added material and I will go elsewhere and write something else, and you can take over doing the anti - tank warfare article 'properly'. Ok ? __label__5 The C specification says tm _ years is "Years since 1900." Why not just stick to the standard and avoid this whole mess ? __label__5 I ' m always amazed at how many questions are similar to this. Are people itching to write code like this ? __label__5 exact duplicate of your 5 minute old question [How to receive and use a json in ajax sended from php?](http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 4317587 / how - to - receive - and - use - a - json - in - ajax - sended - from - php). Are you for real ? __label__5 Give us more details about your setup. Are you using Wubi, Partitions, or haven ' t even started yet ? __label__5 I did notice that some articles linked to the ones I worked on are now missing, which leaves a link hanging. If you ' re going to delete articles, shouldn ' t someone clean up these broken links ? __label__5 Ruby doesn ' t even have an official spec, so I doubt that there ' s a properly correct answer. In any case, why do you need to know this ? __label__5 Okay, so yeah, it ' s possible that that ' s his intent, but I even if it were, I don ' t see why the file has less value. Are interviews with BLP subjects not considered valid EL ' s general ? __label__5 @Andrew I beg to differ, the examples aren ' t good enough to explain what he wants. It ' s like saying "I need *something*, for instance a car, so can you help?".__label__5 This is tough because personal environments are usually already customized, so apples - to - apples comparisons are hard to come by. To start, you might indicate what your system is (Ubuntu version, hardware) and even include a relevant benchmark for your current set - up ? __label__5 I have no idea how your matrix looks like or what you are really trying to do. Could you re - phrase the question ? __label__5 Joe Mills ' s answe is technically correct but I ' m not sure it ' s what you ' re after? Why don ' t you explain what you ' re trying to do rather than ask how something works ? __label__5 It is an obvious and strongly followed point that april fools jokes ''should not disrupt the running of the wiki''. Could you explain why the HELLS you coated a dozen users' pages with pictures of jimbo ' s ugly bearded fizzogg ? __label__5 I don ' t think so, Giano. Can we just once attempt to let this pass by without calling for the heads of people ? __label__5 Ow my eyes. Why are you not using `use strict; use warnings;`?__label__5 Error 500 means, that connect to Apache is working, but something behind it does not. What can you see in /var / log / apache2 / error . log after trying to see the page ? __label__5 Could you explain how data were collected and what they intend to measure? Are the different columns of your data matrix independent measurements ? __label__5 Was it you who deleted the section in Victor Garber ' s article about his sexuality and his partner? If yes, what was the reason ? __label__5 No problem, It was open and shut <url> issue. For your next project can you find something that doesnt make your fanclub at the Wikipedia Review angry ? __label__5 why they have to in ONE page? why not use CSS sprites ? __label__5 Are the k in “k - CNF” and the k in the question the same variable? And what is the parameter of this problem ? __label__5 Ugh, possibly the ugliest Python code I ' ve ever seen. What are you doing ? __label__5 Not sure how this setup helps migration. Could you please elaborate ? __label__5 You need to further explain this question to get a good answer. Given an integer as input, what is the output that you want ? __label__5 I do not, nor have I ever used other accounts on Wikipedia. Didn ' t you ask me this before ? __label__5 Re your remarks on the talk page of 9 / 11: ''I do not troll''. Comprende ? __label__5 Because Wikipedia is an encylopaedia not a free advertising and self promotion venue. Why do you keep abusing it ? __label__5 They are completely different. Have you even glanced at the documentation ? __label__5 ''Don ' t'' talk ''about'' me, in my virtual presence, and tell someone else to ignore me. Do you understand why this behavior is inappropriate ? __label__5 That ' s reason to expand the treatment to other painters, not to blank this one. And you didn ' t think that there would be more articles on van Gogh paintings ? __label__5 @antti . huima Why? Because you can ' t solve it ? __label__5 As I have said before, it is an issue of breadth vs. depth. Are you familiar with such concepts ? __label__5 `transistors`? `transistor - level`?__label__5  " issues"? What issues ? __label__5 brian speaks truth. The best answer is "don ' t" followed by "why did you want to do that?"__label__5 How ridiculous is the answer you ' re looking for? Do you want a 3 - layer solution, with `i % 3` as a configurable business logic ? __label__5 And what did I do wrong??__label__5 Since the "discussion" was not advertised at the affected pages, it did not involve the "community". Do you not see that ? __label__5 Since when is `String` a primitive? Since when can you store primitives in a `Collection`?__label__5 Do you mean something like "Intrateam 30 - minute meeting"? Or does it have to be one word ? __label__5 I based my sentence on the citation. Are you saying the citation is wrong ? __label__5 What do you mean "it just dies"? What ' s the error ? __label__5 Which of course is all the more ironic as my initial edits were an attempt to ''improve'' the article per <url>. Who the hell would have predicted all this ? __label__5 First, why are you saving an image into the database? Second, how are you loading the bytearray into the other ? __label__5 I was trying to be sarcastic, ok??__label__5 Why can ' t you just remove the offending phase and repost your comment? This resolves the situation, does it not ? __label__5 All the images? In the whole world ? __label__5 Why on earth have you deleted the article on the <url>? Can you please undelete it ? __label__5 I started, but gave up. And why link the word 'mother'?__label__5 What do you mean with "it doesn ' t work" ? Does it crash (which I suspect, given your code), does it show the wrong images, doesn ' t it do anything at all ?__label__5 hmm.. nothing??__label__5 What? Can you say what you question is in one sentence ? __label__5 What about ''Race, Ethnicity and Migration in Modern Japan'' (Weiner 2004)? Or any of the dozens of books you can find on Google by searching Ainu+Honshu ? __label__5 I didn ' t see your internal link, I put it back. <url> isn ' t orphaned, what are you talking about ? __label__5 Woohoo--279 hits! Hey Scientist, is that an all - time low ? __label__5 The YA article is a right trainwreck, and having had to do much of the exact same work on <url> and <url>, I ' m not keen to do it again a third time on <url>, and then defend three separate articles from identical POV pushes. Thoughts ? __label__5 Personal attacks and refusing to answer questions. What are you hiding ? __label__5 Consider rephrasing your title. "How complex is the documentation you write?"__label__5  " Hablo ingles?". ROFLMAO ? __label__5 While automatically running a rootkit removal / detection tool on a live system might help you discover less sophisticated rootkits, you should also be aware of its limitation. Assuming your system has been infested by a rootkit, how do you know that the rootkit hasn ' t been tampering with your rootkit removal / detection tool ? __label__5 And wasting our time as well. I can only repeat: why don ' t you do constructive work by adding contents about your beloved Makedonia ? __label__5 Oh, no, sorry. Why do you want to talk to me on IRC ? __label__5 This strikes me as a rather weird use of templates. What is it that you are trying to achieve ? __label__5 Huh? Who the hell are you ? __label__5 I don ' t think I ' ve used it in Wikipedia. So, if I haven ' t, why did you bring it up ? __label__5 You sure kill educating information. I wounder why ? __label__5 WOW. PLEASE tell me that this will be going to FAC ? __label__5 I fail to see how you call copyleft "selfish", but are fine with the idea of totally proprietary licenses. Wouldn ' t those be even more selfish, then ? __label__5 this has nothing to do with C#. Why did you add it as a tag ? __label__5 Google searches really should help you get most of what you need. What are you learning if you ' re just asking people for code ? __label__5 Thanks, Anu. Sorry to be a php nitwit, but I tried this and got nothing: '<?php wp _ get _ post _ terms('20', 'toolkit', 'description') ?>' should I have left it as '<?php wp _ get _ post _ terms($post->ID, 'toolkit', 'description') ?>' ?__label__5 Sure, done. (what ' s up with these 15 - character minimums?)__label__5 Oh and you seem to have deleted half of the stuff on <url> .. I presume this was a mistake ? __label__5 Why do you want to cook fish for someone who doesn ' t like it? Why not just give her something else ? __label__5 this is source code.. what is the question? Do you really think that throwing code at us will solve your problem?!__label__5 If you have never got it working, why should you do it everyday? Did I miss something ? __label__5 I guess I sent you something about the <url> project and Welsh data. But you were also somehow silent on lists like gnome - i18n, weren ' t you ? __label__5 Liked that <url> I tore into that spammer? Got a box with a gun ? __label__5 Oh? You know something I don ' t, Friday ? __label__5 Why did you revert my edits on that page? You say it was unsourced but it was sourced, I put two references to two fair sources (not blogs nor politicaly bound), so why did you remove them ? __label__5 OK, then, define "bias", propose a way to quantify it, and if it ' s accepted by consensus, we ' ll apply it to ''all'' the admins on that page. Or, perhaps as a starting point, how about presenting some evidence ? __label__5 @chris I ' m missing something obvious.. Why is that annoying? Cause the page never stops loading ? __label__5 OK, now I see the <url>. Wouldn ' t it have been better to just say "see talk" in the edit summary so that editors don ' t think that you just moved it on a childish whim ? __label__5 what is your problem? what is your question ? __label__5 Don ' t add any more trash to the article. Got it ? __label__5 No matter how efficient you are it is going to take a loong time to enumerate through 2^100 subsets of vertices, and that is before you get into the fact that edges can be there or not. Can you switch to a problem that is likely to finish before the Sun explodes ? __label__5 Could you kindly stick to the issue at hand in the FAC? Which is to discuss the article, not me ? __label__5 Do we have any Wikipedia regulars here who could perhaps advertise this thread at http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Talk : List _ of _ unsolved _ problems _ in _ computer _ science ? Or would it be a bad idea ? __label__5 i think there is a LOT of information you arent telling us. are there any examples of headers and footers you are trying to make ? __label__5 I am for some reason disappointed that it took me a few seconds longer to pick up the Bon Jovi reference than it did the Tom Petty one. Does that mean the terrorists have already won ? __label__5 How did I vandalize!!??__label__5 Further: it seems to me that <url> was a perfectly reasonable dab page. I wonder why you needed to change it ? __label__5 Do you have a specific geodatabase in mind or are you looking for general material. Same for Python: Are you looking for ESRI specific material or more general ? __label__5 Lol -- +1. What **compiler** are you using ? __label__5 If you have something to say for keeping that picture, say it here and I ' ll copy it over to the FFD page. But, frankly, if you can ' t even be bothered to check out the <url> rules to find out about why the Zguri image isn ' t acceptable, how do you expect to be able to make any relevant argument about the other one ? __label__5 miles per hour? really ? __label__5 You lived next to her? What did you do wrong ? __label__5 This isn ' t a question about LaTeX or friends, but about installing texlive. Perhaps move it to super user ? __label__5 Yeah, and why don ' t it try to convert 'abc' to int and add to 1? Apples + Bananas gives you what ? __label__5 Can you add a reference to the LP bug, i . e. link it from your question ? __label__5 well, what are you getting instead? What is the problem ? __label__5 I mean, are you adding some form fields in a node edit form, or are you creating a custom form in a different page? In the latter case, how do you get the node ID for which the form would show the coordinates ? __label__5 @Kerrek SB: Each string in the input is printed out exactly once in the output, with at most an additional comma to separate them. I don ' t see how that would come out to "pages", unless you are being sarcastic and there is something I am missing ? __label__5 I see no question here. What is your question ? __label__5 I ' m sorry I ' m not sure do I understand you. Are you looking for something like [OSSTMM](http://ww . isecom . org / osstmm/) or the software which would support logistics / management side of the pentesting project ? __label__5 Third: it ' s August 31 2010. Please check my userpage for reasons why I really don ' t feel useful today. Ask another admin, okay ? __label__5  " New dictator?" Who ' s the old one? And who are "others in your gang"?__label__5 Such as the redundant link to ''Roe v. Wade''? Not an improvement ? __label__5 How about some screenshots? (Hmm, does stackoverflow have facilities for that?)__label__5 Maybe he wants to know why *usually* angular velocities are characterized by vectors and rotations by matrices. Is that your question ? __label__5 It ' s on the talkpage - you are deleting like crazy. I can ask for a Cabral if you like ? __label__5 What do you mean they are not related to the scope of <url>? Like which articles ? __label__5 Hello?? Are you just pretending I don ' t exist ? __label__5 oh sorry mr. wizard yeah i meant math in general - can i change it somehow ? __label__5 How are the printers connected? Via network, or via usb ? __label__5 Isn ' t it? Homework is work too, or are you only allowed to get answers for free if you are actually payed to find them yourself ? __label__5 Do you want the complete question solved yourself? What exactly is the question here ? __label__5 Your "resolution" was to move it back to "Detective Terry Crowley" again? Why do you keep doing that ? __label__5 The question should not be "are assertions good?", but rather, "when are assertions good?"__label__5 OK, we are talking about two remaining articles here. The categories serve absolutely no categorization purpose, so why are you being stubborn about it ? __label__5 Your comment about "the additions were left intact as a courtesy" sounds a bit strange to me. Maybe you should read <url>?__label__5 Oh, how I hate such changed behaviour..^^ Why would you do that? If you write a letter in word, would you expect it to save the text in a file when hitting enter or should it begin an new line ? __label__5 ''The sources are already there!'' Have you even looked at it ? __label__5  “ IE6 is deprecated” — by whom? Have you got a source for this ? __label__5 This is irritating. What browser are you using ? __label__5 And why exactly am I looking at your monobook? And why did you substitute your user links onto here ? __label__5 show some code ? what u mean not work ?__label__5 Wait you ' re writing a thesis and you ' ve got *no clue how to use it*? Wow. Usually, it should be the other way round, shouldn ' t it ? __label__5 Notability is an issue of common sense: you ' re writing for other people, so what is notable for you (or me) is not that relevant. My local shop is more important and notable ''to me'' than Wal - mart, but who, other than me, actually cares ? __label__5 So, Pasquale, you ' re not interested? Have you ever read <url> article ? __label__5 Okay. If something about the Camelbak bladders is better, could someone who has a basis for comparison please note that ? __label__5 so what is your problem? You don ' t know how to copy the content ? __label__5 You should know that adding the tag "homework" to your question still doesn ' t convince many people to do all the work for you. Could you at least show us what you came up with so far ? __label__5 I ' m just saying that Kingboyk hasn ' t really been editing lately. So if you ' re actually interested in resolving an issue, why not take it to a noticeboard ? __label__5 Sorry, just to clarify: So I should try changing index . php (which is the splash page now) to index . html with the addition of the head content? Or do you mean change index2 . php to index . html ? __label__5 You ' re joking? <person> and <person> have no word play in spite of the same kanji ? __label__5 but how? where will i write the code snipt ? __label__5 hook _ form should have only 2 arguments. Where $foo is coming from ? __label__5 Did you build the wheels for your car on your own, or you bought the ready ones from the store? If you didn ' t reinvent the wheels literally, why are you considering it metaphorically ? __label__5 However, as you can see, I provided citation for my edit. Will you revert THAT and accuse me of vandalizing ? __label__5 Can someone explain to me why this is not a real question. How is it off - topic to being a programmer? :|__label__5 I asked you a question. Be educated and please respond: What does <url> has to do with <url>?__label__5 This was supposed to have been moved to <url> per the CFD. Why wasn ' t it moved ? __label__5 why would you have to upload the access database? isn ' t it already on the server??__label__5 thats the error? just one line ? __label__5 And personally I ' m not gonna apologize for <url>. Quite a bit different than a Holocaust denier like Nordling, don ' t you think ? __label__5 @There: That ' s a lot of code to wade through. Are you saying you can ' t possibly simplify it in any further ? __label__5  " Malbrain, I can ' t understand you, in either your comments to the talk page.." is the criteria being used by user WHOSASKING to make reverts of my edits. Since when does any one editor have to understand all the material of a subject known by the other editors ? __label__5 ??You wat ? __label__5 Please provide more detail of what you have "Kabob" (kebab) is not a technical term, and means many different things depending where you live. Are the Kebabs raw or cooked? Why do you think it will not be tender ? __label__5 If I had asked you, the same thing that I did would have been accomplished. Why force you to go through the trouble of removing them if someone else is already removing all the others ? __label__5 The hash is used (often) to capture state, while a URL (as its [definition suggests](http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Uniform _ Resource _ Locator)) is for **identifying a resource**. So again, why would you push a non - existent url into the browser ' s history ? __label__5 yes. ambiguous dates are of little value to the intended audience. When is the cutoff for an app or library to be considered ? __label__5 your ' re title of your question says 'smokey flavor', yet in the body of the question it says 'charcoal flavor', which is it ? __label__5 You could try telling us what the errors you are getting are. Or are we supposed to guess ? __label__5 looks like problem with xorg or video driver. does it happen outside of the terminal ? __label__5 Ya, seriously. 17 questions and no selected answers ? __label__5 @Sachin - please post COMPLETE real code. You do realise the snippet posted won ' t compile and run without `Config` class definition, right ? __label__5 @littleadv and what ' s so strange? if I have this program running over bilion times, what ' s so strange, do you mind answering ? __label__5 ? What ? __label__5 @Brian useful != possible. The question was, what is possible ? __label__5 Calling all changes for vandalism just because you don ' t agree with them is NOT the way to explain why you reverts edits. May I suggest that you actually learn what vandalism actually means before you use the word ? __label__5 I would say that it has nothing to do with the language, but with programming. Since this is homework, I suppose that you should know at least something about this subject ? __label__5 Did you change the Document type, or is it the standard one used by Drupal? Which error does Firebug report ? __label__5 now??__label__5 Unless you provide a wikipedia article, with solid references od proof of notability of the term, I am going to delist it. I ave no doubts that there was a dilike of Portugals (like any other major nation), but was this word in notable circulation ? __label__5 This question, while not an award - winner, is at least much more specific. How about we close the *other* one ? __label__5 I don ' t see any of that in his deletion log. Would you please find out which one it was as evidence so you ' re not blindly accusing an admin of deleting something they didn ' t delete ? __label__5 Very informative about your daily life, but not a question. Can you please ask a clear question ? __label__5 Besides this isn ' t asking for a web app solution, rather a server side solution. Off Topic ? __label__5 Why are you doing this? If `rate` has a 1 : 1 relationship with `Posts` why not just add a new column to the `Posts` table ? __label__5 I don ' t understand how you find it appropriate to talk about your illegal drug use on your user page. Also, how do you have the right to ban other people ' s usernames with a name like "''BONG''warrior"?__label__5 Why am I never asked to write a feature. Is it because "I is black"?__label__5 The specific claim of Boyer ' s that you included and I deleted was that "cauchy based infinitesimals on limits". Did you see anybody else saying this ? __label__5 cuz then it wouldn ' t be a BINARY search. Any more obvious questions I can answer for ya? :)__label__5 ..I have no clue what you ' re asking me about or seeking me to do. And what does "RTL wikies" mean ? __label__5  " Using an SSD as an SD Card" does not make sense to me. Can you please explain ? __label__5 I didn ' t think the people at Microsoft would be so inconsiderate to say "Hey, your database WILL get corrupt, you have to use a menu command in Access to fix it!" Would they say the same thing to people using SQL Server?!__label__5 Will you have enough RAM to run the system off RAM (i . e. you can load a big compressed archive at boot time), or must it run from the flash card ? __label__5 I ' m sorry but looking back on that edit I won ' t stand for that. Don ' t you think that actually removing the edit summary was a bit.. well.. let ' s say 'abusing sysop powers'?__label__5 Denied. I take it then that you deny responsiblity for an account (which I ' ll not name here) created just four minutes after you made that edit ? __label__5 The press is calling you bisexual. Did you know that ? __label__5 Did you encrypt the actual /home partition using say dm - crypt / LUKS or did you have your user created with the actual home directory encrypted (say /home / jono/) with ecryptfs? In simpler terms, did you do the select the encryption during partitioning or during user handling ? __label__5 Why do you have a problem with the inclusion of Lady Bristol ' s persona prior to her 2nd marriage? And to the inclusion of Somerset ' s son - in - law ? __label__5 Yes, and there has been a user from an AOL IP who has been trolling Pilotguy for weeks. Why must you blindly disagree with everything anyone says to you ? __label__5 You want to transform a string to a byte array but you don ' t want to specify the encoding. How would you possible decode it back to a string without knowing how it was encoded ? __label__5 When we have a GLAM barnstar then you get it .. just for the Hindi article! I cannot explain why you needed to create a Derby page in Hindi - surely it should be there already ? __label__5 It ' s my understanding that it is not possible to change a file ' s ctime without royally screwing everything else up. Why do you need this behavior ? __label__5 What does this have to do with Zeitgeist? I posted on your talk page because this is no longer remotely about the article, why are you continuing to quarrel here ? __label__5 Wait.. "on this specific name / IP address it does not show my acceptance rate properly"? You don ' t actually know what those things mean, do you ? __label__5 LOL the mods closed it right after we pretty much expressed our hate towards every language in existence (including English!!) Why are we in Software again ? __label__5 Are you crazy down here?! What the heck is going on ? __label__5 What platforms are you talking about? Does it have to work across platforms ? __label__5 P . S. Am I allowed to remove any of this abuse from my pages, or will this result in further accussations from <url> and attempts to get me discipled or banned ? __label__5 Okay, you simply posted your homework verbatim.

Please see [Are Career Advice questions useful for anyone except the poster](http://meta . programmers . stackexchange . com / questions / 588 / are - career - advice - questions - useful - to - anyone - except - the - poster / 590 # 590)?__label__5 Hmm.. the price probably depends on the Apple store (e . g. for me prices show in Euros) Which price should we note ? __label__5 <person> I find this conversation remarkable given that you have twice opted to edit war over referencing format to the detriment of an article ' s quality in the last 24 hours on <url>. What gives ? __label__5 Your code will result in 0 . 5. So what ' s your problem ? __label__5 I find these methods quite unnecessary. What ' s the advantage of using these over the very trivial comparisons ? __label__5 Listen, the reason I put those signs in the code 'break - clear' is because the arrangement of the blocks is ''off - key'', at least when looking through IE or Mozilla. Why are you taking them off ? __label__5 Don ' t you think you should remove the welcoming plate of cookies you left at User : Dococe page??__label__5 Sigh. Was this renewed attack necessary now ? __label__5 If you completely disagree then why havn ' t you required references on other airport pages??__label__5 Please, give me example with a number, otherwise I don ' t understand. Also, would that be used as a question in that situation described above ? __label__5 Yes, I have. Did you really need to send me a reminder ? __label__5 Please explain how that is a personal attack?

Are you claiming that the references make the blog post a reliable source, or why are we still discussing this ? __label__5 ChrisO, am I being paranoiac or are you undertaking some kind of campaign against me? What exactly are you referring to this time ? __label__5 You have been accused of sockpuppetry at <url>. Scared ? __label__5 It ' s unclear what you ' re trying to do.. why are you concatenating the strings if you don ' t *want* them concatenated? Could you give more sample inputs / outputs ? __label__5 On second thought, the mix of pseudo - politeness, vulgarity and threats is..really creepy. Could ya..stop ? __label__5 I reverted your change to the Pet Shop Boys article - it was kind of a bizarre change (i would have considered it the work of a vandal were it not for the seemingly valid other wikipedia work you ' ve done). ?__label__5 after trying to edit your post I realize your syntax is totally bunked or you copied and pasted it wrong. Is this everything ? __label__5 You *want* to see your password in your cookie? I suppose you like it when sites email you your *forgotten password* too ? __label__5 What ' s wrong with having everything look the same, the links are for the Official website of the channel so I don ' t see the problem??__label__5 can you post an example for "language fieldset" on user - edit page, please? I ' ve created mymodule . module and pasted your code above, what to write in // Change $form array to alter form components? :)__label__5 So you don ' t like people pointing out the errors you make? Or do you have any actual arguments to counter my post ?
