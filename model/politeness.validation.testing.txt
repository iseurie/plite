__label__0 Well, what does the message say? It must give some more detail than that *somewhere?*__label__0 Interesting question. I wonder if there might be a difference between fresh and dried pasta ? __label__0 Is the array supposed to be dynamic? i . e. you can update the array after the pre - process step ? __label__0 @chaman, sorry I can ' t figure out what exactly it is you want. Are we talking about the chapter title that only appears once, such as "1 Introduction" or do you want to know how to change your heading that appear on every page of the chapter ? __label__0 Hey how are you? Now I can ' t find you online, where are you lol ? __label__0 Sure thing, you ' ve been doing great work so far. Would it help to maybe translate the whole article first as it is, and then over the course of time you can play around with the sections and add stuff that you find ? __label__0 @TLP thanks for the explanation. So `\@returned` is `$data _ structure _ reference`, right ? __label__0 At <url> there ' s a request that seems to cry out for a Wikipedian with a subscription to the Daily Gleaner. Might you be able to help ? __label__0 I really like the template you used at <url> but it dosen ' t seem to exist on the WP : Vandalism page. Where can I grab it ? __label__0 Sorry for the delay in responding. The problems seems to have calmed down at this point, is that correct ? __label__0 It seems to work fine for me. Can you check if there is any place that is doing a HtmlEncode() replacement on hlNonTerminal . Attributes["onclick"]?__label__0 Thanks for the edit. Do you have any informaytion on <url> and artists associated with <url>?__label__0 Hello. Can you please pass the pilot whale article ? __label__0 Well, lyrics are generally frowned upon on Wikipedia, unless the song is old enough that its copyright no longer applies. Could you perhaps link to the article ? __label__0 Yes it does, but the weird thing it ' s that all the other user attributes are getting passed (When i take a look at the console, every other value but the client _ id hash it ' s getting passed from the form). Do you think that the fact that I ' m also using authlogic for this same model may be something to do with it ? __label__0 Sorry for the slow reply, something I needed to take care of. <url> is restored- if it is mentioned in such <url>, could you please <url> them in the article ? __label__0 I ' ve made some improvements to <url>, keeping in mind your previous comments about the article. Since you gave its grade before, would you like to see it if it could be reassessed ? __label__0 Thank you for catching Known for Know. How did you happen to look at the article ? __label__0 Hello. Since you have contributed to <url> in the past, could you spare a minute to discuss the fate of <url>?__label__0 +1 - very welcome update for an inspiring simple yet really entertaining game; given your new employment I ' ve long expected this transition, free - time project or not ;) One question though: why do you have to 'add / enable' new sites? Having a threshold in place should allow for this to happen automatically in principle, no ? __label__0 Cool, I ' d be happy to help out. :-) What kind of things are you thinking about removing or adding ? __label__0 I seconded wholeheartedly your proposal at <url>. Could you please add a link to the discussion ? __label__0 With all due respect, that is going to take ages. How can one create a 'Bot' to do all this for me for <url>, <url>, <url>, <url> and <url>?__label__0 Welcome to SO. What is a Try It Editor ? __label__0 Mel, is the above comment from you? If not, could you please respond ? __label__0 Thanks. Aside from rewrites and creations (which I ' ve no mind for), anything in particular you see that I should focus on, or is it going okay ? __label__0 Excellent, thanks! I wonder if it ' s worth temporarily uploading a cropped image for the main page, as 100x100 is really very small ? __label__0 I may be missing something but I agree with @whuber. I do not see why you need an approximation g ( x) when you have h ( x)^+ and in what sense will any other function g ( x) be better than h ( x)^+?__label__0 Have you looked at free GUI automation tools like [AutoIt](http://ww . autoitscript . com / site / autoit/)? Maybe it can do what you need ? __label__0 Not sure what you ' re asking exactly. Can you give an example of sample input and output ? __label__0 Which little tag are you referring to? As for your second question, that does depend on a couple of things- you can send it through the official OTRS address, if you like, and someone will get to you in due course, but you ' re welcome to forward the email to me personally at jmilburninfaerun AT gmail . com, and I ' ll take a look at it for you, and upload the image / explain why it ' s not possible ? __label__0 @Jakub Hampl: At my current stage of design, it is more of a logic based game rather than an animation driven game. Out of curiosity, could you expand on the more powerful topic you were mentioning ? __label__0 The reason for using "Please try not to eat the semicolon" was simply because I couldn ' t come up with a better example. Would there be any difference if it was related ? __label__0 Hi, I noticed that you ' ve pointed out an accuracy in the restoration of <url> used in the article. I ' ve just started up a review page for paleoart here, and started a section for that image: <url> Would you mind commenting on it so it can be fixed ? __label__0 I ' ve restored the histories of the userboxes; however, I would think it better to move them rather that cnp - move. Do you mind if I migrate these to your userspace for you ? __label__0 Hi. I uploaded three very nice images in the <url>, can you please tell me what breed could that dog be ? __label__0 Any chance the wire between the switch and the ceiling is 200ft. long? ;p__label__0 Following your comments, I ' ve improved the article a bit more. Do you think it ' s ready for A - class review ? __label__0 You can construct a unique Binary Search Tree given any two traversals, are you looking to do that or are you in search of something else? If not please elaborate what you mean by non unique trees ? __label__0 I don ' t think it needs the Homework tag, as even though this is homework, the question and answer would be the same regardless of the source. Do other people have to tag their questions in regards to their current occupation on the project ? __label__0 Please specify the environment / language in the question / tags. Is it .net / winforms ? __label__0 Hate to be a bother.. but need help with getting the bot running? Anything I can do as a non programmer ? __label__0 I received a message from the bot you run telling me that one of two duplicate files I uploaded is due for speedy deletion. If possible, could it be made that Bath _ badge . png is the one that is deleted, rather than Bath _ rugby _ badge . png please ? __label__0 You may want to comment on the A7 to ?2 graph with 4 lines. I suspect it is nonsense - but what are your thoughts on that folding option ? __label__0 Hey Nick, thanks for writing the book reviews! Would you like me to run one or both of them ? __label__0 Thanks, will check that out. Is there a advantage / disadvantage using setjmp / longjmp over signals as proposed below ? __label__0 That ' s a very appealing recipe by the way. Do you have a cast iron waffle iron? What are you using to cook them ? __label__0 So you mean you just can ' t use date functions, yes? Presumably comparison, multiplication and subtraction are okay? :-)__label__0 thanks for the welcome! I have a question.. how come you can ' t edit the article about Whales ? __label__0 Thanks for the update - where did you find out that the construction has changed ? __label__0 Good point Dan. instead of the OK / Cancel stuff, have you (user583126) considered a < noscript > solution ? __label__0 No problem. Have you heard anything new about HRE ? __label__0 So then "good luck with your upcoming defense" and "congratulations" (assuming it goes well:)? Are you headed somewhere else where you will be able to continue working with students on WP - Chem stuff ? __label__0 Thank you, it ' s much appreciated. What do you think of the changes so far ? __label__0 Could you please elaborate for me? (RDB are not my strongest suit so forgive my ignorance) How can I normalize when there is only one table and no relationships ? __label__0 Thanks for the advice but that ' s why I remove the "Thank you for your contributions" on the welcoming template. Is that still okay to do ? __label__0 Thanks! What type of documentation do you want u2014 an explanation of using the notes feature ? __label__0 Thanks for change to Hugh de Grandmesnil - I am (It is) very short of refs for that article. Could you suggest one for your addition ? __label__0 Hi, <url> to <url> broke the templates. Can you fix that, please ? __label__0 I think the question could bring some good answers. But maybe it ' s more fitting to make it a CW ? __label__0 Hey there, just curious if the changes made to the GA Nomination for Dan Brouthers were sufficient for pass. If not ready for pass, anything else I can do to expedite the process ? __label__0 @GoodEnough It ' s not about other people reading your mail but about giving Google all your data. You now, *Do be evil* (or how was their slogan?).__label__0 Greetings, sorry to bother you here.. I have been using the MissingTopics tool for years, to generate <url> The last time I used it successfully was Nov 16. Something must have changed in the algorhythms since then, because it will no longer read any page starting with an Amharic character.. Is it broke ? __label__0 Hello Jennica, I noticed you revert vandalsm occasionally. Would you like me to grant your account <url> to help you revert vandalism more easily ? __label__0 Interesting. Would you mind asking at which Sae Gae seminar on what date it was taken ? __label__0 That example sentence doesn ' t really feel right. You sure you don ' t mean to use the past perfect ? __label__0 You ' ll have to give us a bit more context here. Can you provide a code snippet that displays this problem ? __label__0 Thanks for the heads - up on that; I don ' t really have anything to add beyond what you ' d said. By the way, I noticed you said you weren ' t an admin: would you like to be ? __label__0 Hello user1293, and welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which Drupal version are you interested ? __label__0 Thanks for offer of help on IRC - terminology completely baffling to me (not helped by freenode instructions written as if translated through several languages into final english) - just which channel are admins supposed to log into, and how does one register when it seems by invitation only. Finally what on earth is a cloak ?__label__0 Yeah, I didn ' t cover the why, but it ' s a good question. Maybe they need to add some kind of searching "engine" or something.. but where are they going to get one of those ? __label__0 The question is ambiguous. Can you please be more specific ? __label__0 Hi @OZ_ - can you educate me as to why? Is there a better way to store images ? __label__0 As opposed to? What should it be instead ? __label__0 I believe that almost all jQuery plugins can work with a ListView. Could you show any code where you attempt to use gallery with a ListView ? __label__0 Thanks for adding that pmc= support to <url>. I made a suggestion for further improvement in <url>; can you please follow up there if you have the time ? __label__0 sorry guys, i actually don ' t really know what acceptance that you guys mentioned. Can you guys explain please ? __label__0 I had a look at the place noted on the top of the talk page about 1rr and I was unable to find the sanction you talked about. Where is it listed please ? __label__0 I ' m always happy to give a second opinion on ID - you ' re welcome to put images on my talk page to discuss them. Regarding <url>, I would tend to go with ''<url>'', what do you think ? __label__0 Hey, long time no seeing! How ' s stuff ? __label__0 Are you looking for something that gives you a global view? For instance to see the difference in load time from Texas and Tokyo ? __label__0 @blunders: However it still isn ' t clear to me what you really want to ask. What is the problem you ' re experiencing ? __label__0 I know what KMP stands for but not BM. Would you mind writing down what each of them stands for, in case others don ' t know ? __label__0 Yes, my feeling is to err on the safe side here. Thanks for your comment, is it okay if I quote you on the commons thread ? __label__0 Thanks for the info! Did you need to do anything special to get theme preprocess hooks working ? __label__0 I ' m interested in why you reduced the columns from 5 to 2? Could you reply on my talk page please ? __label__0 Hi, thanks for unprotecting the <url> article. Could you also unprotect <url> so a redirect can be created ? __label__0 Thanks for your assistance in the review of the Brian Keith review at the DYK! The user has cited the Internet Movie Database before ? __label__0 Thanks for nuking that thing. While the page was still present, someone opened an <url>..could you please close it ? __label__0 Hi, I did post at <url> about the new Civil Ensign for Jersey but I ' ve not had a reply yet. Any thoughts ? __label__0 Could you clarify what you mean by #4? Does this mean that the lists of objects on each edge leading away from node _X_ are always a subset of the list of objects on the edge leading towards _X_?__label__0 @Firebrandt: Could you, please, add the clarification what you meant by better in your question. What do you mean by outlining the solution - how to fill table entries in the table from Garey and Johnson book ? __label__0 You are welcome. Do i correctly understand that you plan to use the <url> account as your primary account from now on ? __label__0 I have just put the article to peer review. Would you care to take a look ? __label__0 @Caf, you are right. What was I thinking ? __label__0 High level questions are fine, but this one is really broad. It would help if you could narrow your question to something a little more specific or provide more context ? __label__0 I ' d be glad to help, if you like. How should we divide it, by section or by criteria ? __label__0 Presumably the CfD will be inconclusive. Given the technical issues, perhaps an RfC might be more helpful ? __label__0 Sorry, I did not know there has been a category before. Can you delete it ? __label__0 another great example for how google makes you stupid. does nobody ever read the documentation anymore ? __label__0 I was just now leaving a note on Ruhrfisch ' s talk page, and noticed that you ' d left a note there. I wrote about the <url> the other day, the first time that I ' ve ever created an NRHP article: would you be willing to check it, and to add to the infobox if there ' s something that can easily be added ? __label__0 Yeah I ' d be happy to look at the list, however can ' t promise much! Shall we discuss it on the article ' s talk page so that any comments are in the relevent place ? __label__0 Maybe show some code and / or image examples. If compatibility is important, have you considered using an animated GIF ? __label__0 Oops, this was meant to be on Stack Overflow. Can someone migrate it please ? __label__0 Perhaps you could explain why you believe that these *should* be related? Do you have any evidence that supports this belief ? __label__0 I have the same issue.. This has worked for me in the past. Did you find a solution yet ? __label__0 Avogadro ' s number ($6 . 02 \times 10^{23} \mathrm { mol}^{-1}$) and Boltzmann constant ($1 . 38 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm { J}\,\mathrm { K}^{-1}$) are two totally unrelated constants. You want to estimate both ? __label__0 Can you clarify? What ' s the list supposed to contain ? __label__0 I am not sure I fully understand the question, is it like having to make 2 piles of different units that will be the closest in total construction time ? With the only constraint that piles cannot exceed 5 elements ? __label__0 Great question. Perhaps it should have the pronunciation tag ? __label__0 I ' ve been trying to convince this user that his only problem is his username, but he doesn ' t seem to fully believe it. Would you mind popping over and giving a word or two of encouragement ? __label__0 Hi Asbestos! This is kind of weird for me but I see that you are a participant in the photo project and list yourself as a photographer in Edinburgh and I was wondering if there was any possibility that you would be willing to respond to my recent request <url>?__label__0 Thank you much! May I call upon you if I make mistakes or need help, then, please ? __label__0 Perhaps rephrase it to something like, "What do you look for when choosing a distribution?", or "Which distribution would best suit scenario X?"__label__0 Welcome to WikiProject Austria. I ' m wondering if you ' re willing to coordinate the project for a while ? __label__0 Some otherwise useless kitchen gadgets might have other valid uses. I never use a garlic press (just another thing to clean, when I can crush it with the side of my knife), but they can make play - doh hair (or really small noodles?)__label__0 Sorry for not replying sooner. What would you like done with your page ? __label__0 Thanks for the redirect help! Is that something I can do myself in the future, or is that an admin thing ? __label__0 I ' d like to support iOS 3 . 0 because it ' s the project ' s requirement. Can you help ? __label__0 Good question. I wonder if it should be migrated to CS Theory (http://cstheory . stackexchange . com/) or Programmers (http://programmers . stackexchange . com/) ?__label__0 Would a tool that provides an RSS feed for a tag work alright? What OS are you using ? __label__0 OT : Is my edit of the post a good way to add on - topic questions? What do you suggest else ? __label__0 Ok, that ' s no problem. Can you recommend any other users who would be able to train me ? __label__0 I was looking for some help with editing portals, I ' ve read up on some stuff but still don ' t quite understand. Do you think you could help me ? __label__0 Could you take a look at the article now and see whether your concerns (except the reorganization) have been addressed? If not, what is still missing, and what technical terms do you feel need explaining ? __label__0 Sorry to up this, I found it via google, but it seems to work when the private static final field is a primitive type. Does anyone have an idea why ?__label__0 oops, sorry i re - edited my post. can you please validate it with the .xml doc i just posted it ?__label__0 Greetings, and thank you for your cogent remarks at <url>. Would you be interested in voting in the straw poll <url> as well ? __label__0 Please elaborate: UI design or general software architecture design? Or anything else ? __label__0  [ nvidia - 96](http://apt . ubuntu . com / p / nvidia - 96) should be what you need. What is the output of `dmesg | grep -i nvidia` and `grep -i nvidia /var / log / Xorg . 0 . log`?__label__0 The new features of Hotcat are excellent: whom do I thank for this? :-) Are you still its maintainer ? __label__0 Nice to see you editing in article space! We have been chipping away at your compiled OBI list - can you believe it ' s almost done ? __label__0 I used the <url> tool, and clicked rather a lot. I ' m happy to switch it on for your account, if you ' d like ? __label__0 Hi! What would you like help with in particular ? __label__0 Please post the actual compiler message. Does the error occur with minimal source files (just the mentioned lines without the stuff implied by ..)?__label__0 I ' ve made some changes to the <url>, and started a discussion on the template talk page. I ' m a bit stuck on some bits of table formatting and linking, so I wondered if you ' d be able to help ? __label__0 Thanks for the answer do you know of anything I could use for the fixings with the foundations ? __label__0 Someone has Blocked the whole Opera mini Browser, as you know even i use my Mobile - Opera for editing. can you please help ? __label__0 @adatapost great! however, do you mean APIs / sites that you can reference from your site (such as Google Analytics), sites where you upload your logs to, or both? :)__label__0 Thank you for telling me. Can you please revert my deletion, for I do not yet know how to do so ? __label__0 That ' s OK &mdash; my pleasure. Have you tried the IMDb ? __label__0 Thanks for continuing to look over the article. Do you know or do you know anyone that knows anything about the <url> or the <url>?__label__0 I ' m sorry, but I ' m really struggling to understand what the problem is. Would you mind rephrasing the text after the first code sample ? __label__0 Hello, Ruben; welcome on _Drupal Answers_. For which Drupal version are you asking the question ? __label__0 @Sriram : yup I will think of it on a small scale first ..then perhaps later will look into the bigger picture :-) ..thanks for ur suggestions !! :-) so what do u feel hw should one get started with this ?__label__0 Hey JC: I saw you move <url> to <url>, which is great, but I was surprised you didn ' t fix any of the double redirects that resulted. Also, the related essay is still entitled <url>; should that be moved (over redirect) as well ? __label__0 The solution reported in the issue report is to replace any occurrence of `unset($form[$id])` with `$form[$id] = array('#language' => NULL)` in the module file; it just a matter of doing a "search and replace" on a file. What do you exactly don ' t understand ? __label__0 Arguably, listing the former constructors and even the template itself is not necessary. Could we please try reinstating the previous version and see if and how many other folk don ' t find the decade information useful / intriguing ? __label__0 Sorry about that, yes it is a taxonomy page then. The code I posted above using get _ terms() was working so that means your code should work too right ? __label__0 Congratulations on your new daughter ' s arrival! What ' s her name ? __label__0 I am good at that ;-). You know about the new "Oversight" priv ? __label__0 Hi Emily! Do you have any ideas about a topic yet ? __label__0 Your new map is a great, less distorting, format, but it leaves out a whole lot of countries that have recently joined the alliance - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia etc among them. Can you fix this please ? __label__0 Nice pie chart for mobile phone contractor %'s during 3rd quarter 2008. Was just wondering though which country the chart represents as I think perhaps this should be mentioned ? __label__0 You ' re brilliant. Thanks :) Now could you just tell me how to make the view show the fields as rows, not columns ? __label__0 Hi Zaps, I ' ve noticed that you edited the abovementioned article. Could you please provide your sources ? __label__0 Ok! First things first, is there anything in particular you would like me to help you out with ? __label__0 I also found your audio uploads at <url>. If it ' s not a burden, would you mind recording more Hungarian town names for WP ? __label__0 Those of us who ' ve been here the whole time are pretty incredulous about it also. :) We miss your fine editing style and hope you come back sometime -- keep looking in on us now and then, at least ? __label__0 Thank you for your answer. For the acidic rub, do you mean like lemon juice? Or more like yoghurt to permeate / tenderize the meat ? __label__0 Out of curiosity, why would a user choose to disable multitasking (i . e. what ' s the tradeoff)?__label__0 Hello again. Could you move this to <url>, please ? __label__0 I ' m sure there is a way to tackle this problem, but we ' ll need more information. Can you try explaining the issue a bit more thoroughly ? __label__0 Please, show your code. How do you toggle this form ? __label__0 TSOP is a series of IR receivers by [Vishay](http://ww . vishay . com / ir - receiver - modules/), here it doesn ' t mean "thin small outline package" or something like that. Right, gomek ? __label__0 Thanks for the advice. Quick question, is the efficiency gain in both the where and sum methods ? __label__0 Thanks for readjusting the <url> remarks on stationsby - I must confess I ' m not that much into Danish history, so my edit contained some guesswork.. thanks for correcting me. Do I understand correctly that a Stationsby would not be the station that originaly is intended for a town further away, around which then a new town grows up ? __label__0 This is a cool question! Where did this come up ? __label__0 It depends on what you are cooking with the egg, because they have a few different roles in a dish. Can you provide more information on which dish you are cooking where you want to replace the egg ? __label__0 Many thanks for your correction on that article. I ' ve been meaning to expand the content, but this might be quicker to address in the short term: I think it may be better to change "consisting of" to "composed of," based on reading some stuff from your user page - thoughts ? __label__0 Thanks for adding that ref to <url>. I don ' t suppose your copy of Conway ' s says anything about the roles and fates of ''Schleswig - Holstein'' or ''Schleisen''?__label__0 Yeah, tough crowd today. Maybe it ' s right after a long weekend? :)__label__0 Good job, great article. Where did you get the idea, out of curiosity ? __label__0 Hi - how ' s it going? Do you need more time ? __label__0 Thank you very much for fixing the broken references in <url> and related articles. Are you planning to fix them in <url> as well ? __label__0 Hi, Schutz; it ' s still busted. Would it be OK with you if I asked GimmeBot to take over the mainpage bolding ? __label__0 Thanks for your reply. I ' ve tried to incorporate the references into the article; how is it now ? __label__0 Thank you very much for your answer. Could you please take a moment and provide the code I would need to add which would allow me to achieve these goals ? __label__0 True. What do you think about the notability of this particular article ? __label__0 Nice. What SVG editor did you use ? __label__0 Thanks, firstly, for the affirmation and work on <url>; it was yesterday ' s featured article! As a related article, I ' ve been working on <url> - what do you think would be necessary to get it to FA ? __label__0 Excellent, thank you! Can you also delete the <url> from en and move hooks from the <url> to <url>?__label__0 I ' m sorry, I don ' t know what article you are talking about. Can you please provide the exact name ? __label__0 Hi, I just couldn ' t understand <url> ! Could you explain , please ?__label__0 The very easiest way to tag an image is to use the Alt Text in picture ' s properties, but I have a feeling this isn ' t what you want based on your example. Can you describe more about not only what you want but how you plan to achieve it ? __label__0 @Kosmonaut: Yes please, I agree with Martha. What is the deal with W ?__label__0 I know `in` is a keyword, used in loops, is it a method too? If so, can you give us an example of usage ? __label__0 Rainer -- thanks. Perhaps you could post an answer with your changes made so that I could see them ? __label__0 Can you please paste the code where you read the integers? Also, what compiler are you using, and on which platform ? __label__0 Thank you. So what did I do to earn the tea ? __label__0 This is quite cool, I ' d almost consider suggesting the ability to encrypt the answers to your question for a day on user voice with a clickable "decrypt" link or something. What do other think ? __label__0 I ' ve nominated a biology - type article, <url>, at <url>. Would you be interested in reviewing it ? __label__0 Thanks for clean - up of the secret talkpage colourer - inner. Aren ' t people odd ? __label__0 Based on the lack of reply, maybe you should take a different approach. What is wrong with installing 300 drivers ? __label__0 That ' s what I thought. :) Well, what is solution for safe managing lua _ State*?__label__0 Sorry for inconvenience. try any help here is it an error ? __label__0 Not what ' s commonly observed -- on the contrary an often heard complaint is that `print` statements from various threads get all mixed up. What platform, OS and version, Python version, etc ? __label__0 Nice! Looks like a good book. Do you suppose you might be able to list some of the more advanced techniques they describe, or provide an excerpt ? __label__0 I ' m suspecting a bad charger; most home screen I ' ve used turns itself on when you just plugged the device in or plugged the device out, if a bad charger somehow causes the device to think that it had just been plugged off and / or plugged on, it could cause the symptoms you ' re having. Have you tried with a different charger and different wall socket ? __label__0 Thanks for the username change. Now, one last thingu2014since the account 'Dalahxe4st' already exists on Swedish Wikipedia and doesn ' t appear to have been taken over automatically, where should I go to take care of that ? __label__0 Sounds like a great idea. Do you want to propose it at the project talk page ? __label__0 Apologies, I was busy prod ' ding this article when you speedily deleted it, so I inadvertently re - created it. Can you delete it again, please ? __label__0 can you explain more please ?__label__0 Thanks for the detailed answer, that ' s really helpful. Is there a way to recognise double / triple butted tubes on eg used frames? Can you hear the thickness change by flicking it with a fingernail ? __label__0 are you using the webSockets API? and is this going to be open sourced at all ? __label__0 Thanks for your help on this, it ' s much appreciated. Should I delete my request for checkuser ? __label__0 Thanks for pointing out that "undiscussed moves" discussion, I hope something comes out of that - but it doesn ' t really look like it will. I ' m not sure what I ' m looking for on the discussion page for <url> about this, what am I missing ? __label__0 Thank you for contacting me, the history has been restored given the link you provided. Would you mind assisting with sourcing of the article so that it complies with <url> policy ? __label__0 First 30 days or last 30 days? Nothing seems to start at 0, is that just a side - effect of the first day traffic / questions spike ? __label__0 When displayed, the menu link will use the defined path alias. Any reason why this isn ' t enough ? __label__0 Thanks for blocking this user -- he promptly erased the warnings on his talk page (I put them back). I guess a block doesn ' t automatically block the talk page, huh ? __label__0 I think these are reasonable, and should protect you from lawyering. Should I go ahead and add this ? __label__0 I don ' t want to be your enemy. What can I do to help this situation ? __label__0 @dmckee: Thank you for replying. Can you please let me know the approach that should be adopted when building a software ? __label__0 Nice work, that explains it quite clearly! Any idea who came up with the scheme ? __label__0 An API is not at fault if they allow requests to take place more than 30 time in 5 seconds, right? Or do we need to build throttling into our API ? __label__0 by "without a public facing server" do you mean the kml *has* to be on the local machine, or that you don ' t want to have to bother with installing / configuring / buying a public website? And, does the custom map you want to make need to be seen by others or just you ? __label__0 Good luck with the remaining time for your nomination. BTW: under what section on <url> do you think it should appear ? __label__0 Thanks for the quick response. Would you have any suggestions on editors who would be interested in this field, or who might have experience with FA reviews ? __label__0 What type of device will be doing the dropping?

It seems to need a table to be set up - do you have the schema or sql for that handy ? __label__0 Some time ago, you uploaded separate maps for each town and unincorporated community in <url>.

And when you say "page template", you mean when you view a blog "page", like About Us ? __label__0 Thank you for taking the time to review my nomination of <url> as a featured article candidate. I have responded to the issues you raised in <url> - could you please review my replies and let me know if you ' re satisfied ? __label__0 thank you for that.

Understanding that this is a BLP, that NPOV is important, and that including secondary sources is nearly impossible as they are difficult (at best) to find, what is your feeling on this ? __label__0 Hi Steve, I ' ve added refs & cites to this article. Do you think it still needs a warning about lack of refs / citations ? __label__0 Nice addition to the <url> article.

Tea or coffee ? __label__0 If it ' s alright with you, I ' m next going to start from 1930 and work back towards where you are, since I ' m particularly interested in the Lang era. Is that okay ? __label__0 It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Do you have a user, entering a name and address, and you are going to show him all similar addresses to let him choose one manually, or are you going to group all Persons with similar addresses automatically together ? __label__0 Thank you for deleting the attack page I tagged. Should <url> be blocked for creating it ? __label__0 Sounds similar to this problem: http://cooking . stackexchange . com / questions / 6433 / why - does - my - velveeta - queso - dip - get - clumpier - the - longer - it - stays - in - the - microwave I guess Velvetta isn ' t designed to be microwaved ? __label__0 Welcome to Stack Overflow!

How do I fix this ? __label__0 Good advice from Garion96 there. Would you please come to the talk page of the template and voice your opinion ? __label__0 Could you please check over the article of <url>. I edited a couple of things and added a few images..could you reply your opinion please ? __label__0 Since you mentioned that P is PCP ( 0, log n), I ' d like to add that it is also PCP ( 0, 0), PCP ( 0, log log n), etc. How does such a characterization help separate it from NP ? __label__0 A little while back, at the beginning of November, I had said that if you ever were considering adminship, that I would love to support and / or nominate you. Do you have any interest in pursuing it ? __label__0 How did you fix this. It doesn ' t seem that simply moving your views into separate modules would work ? __label__0 That is the correct way (AFAIK) for embedding a thumbnail into an RSS feed. What result are you seeing and what result would you expect ? __label__0 Hey. I ' m proposing a <url> - would you be interested in coming along ? __label__0 Please share some recipies of those pastas / 1 dish meals ? __label__0 thanks for your input, it was such a pleasure interacting with you, now that the overlapping projects assessment are done, we need never interact again. projects opting out of policy, how charming, some projects are more equal than others, can i take a vote on SI project opting out of copyright vios ? __label__0 @OMG Ponies: I believe you. :) So, am I misunderstanding that I should be able to access the information from within both tables or am I horribly misunderstanding *how* to set up the tables ? __label__0 This is helpful for automatized transfer scripts. By the way, did I get the location tag right on <url> :-) ?__label__0 If you prepare slightly smaller images, I ' ll insert them in your question. Also, what ' s that thing with truncated titles in your screenshots ? __label__0 What have you tried so far? What problems have you encountered ? __label__0 Hey, what do you think if instead of naming surahs like this <url>, we add the surah number to each like : "Surah 1, Al - Fatiha". Would u agree with such page moves ? __label__0 No problem. :) Did you see the additional notes on the project talk page about the rest of those books from the 70s ? __label__0 Many thanks. I ' m afraid I don ' t know the reel - is it played in your part or the world ? __label__0 Is location important, or are you just looking for a hierarchy? I see you are going to be using "categorization by location", but are you planning on using attributes (like a lookup table) or a spatial search (like "what ' s near me")?__label__0 Hello, I ' m with the project of turning the list <url> hat is the same list in English, but in another language, and more link for azure. I have a problem, <url>, could you help me ? __label__0 When we go to the American Indian museum, they would like our real name ahead of time that way they can get us through security quickly.

What exactly unbrekable space character means ? __label__0 Hi, I was removed from the "request for approval" list at the vandalproof, and not put on either the "approved" or "denied" lists. Could you tell me why, please ? __label__0 Thanks for the <nowiki>{{For</nowiki> templates on Tkachyovs, they help a lot.

Did you know its one week to Halloween, will you be there ? __label__0 After looking through a bunch of those, I think the lead should be formatted like this: a paragraph explaining who he is, a paragraph summarizing his life and career, and a paragraph summarizing why he is so great. What do you think ? __label__0 Thanks for your answer. Could you expand on what 2 hot wires are? Does that mean 2 live wires ? __label__0 This should be a pretty straightforward adaptation of the existing algorithms you linked. Can you post what you have and we can help you along with hints ? __label__0 Yes, I apologize, my friend (I guess I have some kind of a phobia that you will forget about my posts :) ) I will wait as long as you want me to. Could you read Mir Harven ' s posts on talk page ? __label__0 Note that this fix is only for the US Captivate and Vibrant Galaxy S variants. Presumably Samsung are releasing this as a stop - gap until they (or the networks) get round to releasing 2 . 2 for those Galaxy S variants ? __label__0 Nice work so far on your rewrite of "The One After the Superbowl". Are you planning on including info about the Diet Coke fiasco ? __label__0 Thanks Tom! Still getting 'broken / missing handler' errors when adding filters though.. Any ideas ? __label__0 I ' ve always been under the impression that most quick - sort implementations will switch to merge sort after descending a predetermined number of levels of recursion. Would you mind posting your code to see areas for improvement ? __label__0 @Lukas I ' m faced with a similar problem at the moment. Did you ever find a good solution ? __label__0 Good question! What formula did you attempt, and in what situations was it wrong ? __label__0 Ah, well, I forgot that I also did subclass the view object associated with my NSCollectionViewItem subclass while I was working on this today. Perhaps that broke something ? __label__0 @marc thanks. how can i fix it ? __label__0 Okay thanks I ' ll try it! DId you choose the pictures yourself ? __label__0 Hi, I think that you do a fantastic job on DELSORT. However, I was just wondering if, when you add to Schools, whether you would be good enough to add them to the appropriate section, please ? __label__0 Maybe it ' s better just to ask and to provide some rules like: one suggestion per answer, use voting on exisiting ones. Or is this the meaning of community wiki already ? __label__0 Hi Johnuniq, thank you for your edit. Does the file should be deleted / removed from commons then ? __label__0 Done. I may have missed a few links when copying them across, so could you please look through it just in case ? __label__0 @JK, Welcome to Stack Overflow!

Are there other methods ? __label__0 Hey, I saw your article on the ''Mosambique'' in the Good New Article search results and looked at your other contributions, and I see that you do a lot on naval history.

Or are you also looking for firing ranges that allow bicycles ? __label__0 I ' ve asked participants to shift the discussion away from Karchmar--that discussion isn ' t producing any new arguments or sources.

How much batter do you use for each shell ? __label__0 Thanks for voting, even though you didn ' t support. Can you tell me where you thought I was too aggressive ? __label__0 @delnan: thank you.

Care to give it a try ? __label__0 @Paul R: Ok, I have edited my question. Is it better now or something is missing ? __label__0 Hi, thanks for moving three of the Brussels municipalities. Could you move <url> to <url> as well ? __label__0 Am I correct in thinking that you only are interested in paths having minimum edge count across all paths?

Where shall I add it in the list ?__label__0 Hi, I see you voted "support" but in the neutral section. Would you like to move that to the support section ? __label__0 Just looking at it, it looks like a skewed normal distribution. Are you sure the outliers are necessary for your analysis ? __label__0 This sounds like an open ended hardware request, which is likely to get your question closed. Can you make your question any more specific ? __label__0 That is, I would remove the inline reference to the date of the cited source, since it ' s given in the actual footnote. Is that OK with you ? __label__0 Thanks for your advice on my problems with categories. Perhaps someone should change the instructions ? __label__0 Thank you for correcting the error on my user page. I have a question how does one go about archiving his talk history ? __label__0 Except for the one about the Chevrolet Monza bit at the middle which came from the Prototype book, was in fact come from the Brumos website, but the last time I read that was back in February 2001. Also is with the referencing, the page is now a total mess, is there a way that could be sorted out, I would be very thankful if you could help ? __label__0 I love it. Two immediate thoughts (1) what about mapping the space based on probabilities (2) what would a scheme to try and identify the or incorrect answers look like ? __label__0 I would like to first thank you for coding the afd helper app. Secondly, is it possible it could be changed to work with other XfDs ? __label__0 Hi Gareth. I was wondering if you could point me in the right direction for learning about building a wikipedia profile ? __label__0 Perhaps this is not a good candidate for binding to a property grid. Can you set the property, save the result, have that return instantly, and then later on, based on some user action, run your long - running operation ? __label__0 Hello, it was requested that some of the details be removed so as to make the article a bit more general. Is that ok ? __label__0 in certain cases i had to first start the Zune player and then VS2010 to make it work. Perhaps that does the trick for you ? __label__0 What is an eastern style pot? Is this a cup - like device with a lid to strain out the leaves (sorry, don ' t know the name), or something else entirely ? __label__0 Can you be more precise about what exactly the system needs to achieve? Something like "Given X initial data, output Y"?__label__0 Can you please clarify, if you only care about the weights, why you don ' t simply do `data [ x] += w`? What do you care about besides the weights ? __label__0 I had an editorial dispute with a user called <url><, but I ' m not responding to him anymore as it seems to escalate into heated arguments. If he keeps messaging, would it be ok if I got back in touch with you and you had a word with him ? __label__0 Your example above works for me. What kind of output are you getting ? __label__0 I ' m glad you ' re pleased with the general appearance. Before I label all the streets, is the text size, font style, etc OK ? __label__0 Please, be more specific. Where do you want to display pictures, what kind of pictures ? __label__0 Thanks. Before I use, is there are way to deny the bot only within a portion of an article rather than the entire article ? __label__0 I ' m very impressed with your work getting Niagara County ' s NRHP list filled out with pictures and articles! Did you take most of those new pictures yourself ? __label__0 @anony: Nice question! Can you share the site where you found the question ? __label__0 In short, based on the sparse information provided by outsiders, I would like to work constructively with you (and others) to whip the article into shape, as its presence seems warranted but the article is unlikely to garner necessary details from random contributors. What shall I do next ? __label__0 I ' ve gotten that and I remember it went away after a few seconds and then the app would eventually launch. Are you getting that ? __label__0 Perfect, thank you! Can you help with the phonetics of other Nordic languages ? __label__0 What would you like in the case of, e . g., `http://example . com / test . php ? key=val` ? Or `http://example . com / test . htm # section1` ?__label__0 this seems like an interesting question, but I can ' t make heads or tails of it. Do you think you could edit it to explain in more depth, perhaps including links to some of the more technical terms ? __label__0 sorry, but do not have the time to change all. Any way I can rotate only on of the tables ? __label__0 Thanks! Do you know why this was held jointly and what was worked on ? __label__0 Well, welcome, and thanks for helping out, as you can see it ' s greatly needed. Do you have <url> yet ? __label__0 Splendid work on <url>! Do you have a copy of that reference, or use the library ' s ? __label__0 think this is too time localised to be on - topic. Any other thoughts ? __label__0 Can you explain your scenario better? Perhaps with an example ? __label__0 Hello, I noticed you recently did a lot of work on the ''<url>'' page. I was wondering if you know of the origin of the word "Nassarius" - its etymology/ what is it named after ? __label__0 Thanks for the help on the sides of leather question. I ' m interested in citing the dictionary in the article as a reference for the meaning of "sides", but I ' d like to have a little more data first u2014 what year ' s edition of the OED did you cite ? __label__0 Thanks for helping to source alternative names..helps quash everyone including his / her favorite. I don ' t have that ref handy--does "unofficial" mean "lots of people call it that but WMATA doesn ' t", or "it ' s often called that as a nickname even in WMATA or other formal documents"?__label__0 Sorry Allen..Have you been able to reproduce the users problems ? do you trust the user ?__label__0 @Thanatos: Interesting, however that statement implies that there are no multibyte string encodings that have embedded null bytes? Is that correct ? __label__0 Good work on the canal junctions! Where appropriate, do you think we should give the nearest pedestrian access point, from the road (as opposed to canal) network ? __label__0 I ' m leaving radiant / nescott to you. Can I ask you to look at my report of UBeR, please ? __label__0 Hey friend, you are missed on here. What ' s up ? __label__0 In the <url> article, is polar mount correct? It might be improved by a bit more detail about how it works, perhaps ? __label__0 I like yours better, it ' s less demeaning. This is pretty new to me.. should I remove it or leave it ? __label__0 Great work you ' ve been doing on this. Would you agree with me that International Political Economy should be capitalised ? __label__0 Jeff300, thanks a lot for your help with the article. But I ' m just curious - why was the link to the article for "Advent of Divine Justice" deleted ? __label__0 Yes, it is an option, but I have no experience using them.

I ' m a beginner in Android so can you please explain what the meaning of root the phone and set it as S - OFF? also, how shall I do it ? __label__0 Thanks for pointing out a problem with the image licensing .. I must admit despite being a seasoned contributor I find this image licensing stuff pretty confusing and hard to get right .. are there recommended examples of standard things like book covers, album covers, paintings etc? Have I done the Jonah cover ok now, or not ? __label__0 Where did you get the tracklist for the album? Can you please drop me a messafe with the link ? __label__0 Ozan asks a good question below. Out of curiosity, is this just a logic puzzle, or is there a reason someone would need to avoid basic language constructs ? __label__0 Wow, that is a great answer! Thanks for the answer. One more question for you though. How can I tell what the float of the pedal is ? __label__0 <url> is based at 340 Laurier Avenue West Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0P9 - It doesn ' t have a photo posted yet. Is this convenient for you ? __label__0 Welcome to Bicycles . SE!

Where are those stored ? __label__0 @Steve McFarlin, thanks, you have any tips on reading except the qt - documentation to grasp the whole structure of the mov - file because i ' m really having trouble gripping all of it, is it correct that the atom don ' t even need to be in a specific order? which one did you think was easiest to work with mov or mp4 ? __label__0 Ok. Thank you for clarifying. Could you be more specific as to what you are specifying as "the claim" so that I may find relevant information to refute ? __label__0 Thanks again. Do you have any suggestions for how we might change the article to take the practical side of this into account with being (a) inaccurate or (b) overly technical ? __label__0 Thank you for getting to all those WikiProject Canada assessements so quickly!

Do you just perform the rename, and I then re - create the account to take it for myself ? __label__0 I ' ve made a start to putting the list in chart form at <url>. Can you think of any other columns to add ? __label__0 Thanks for the cleanup. Why did you delink the songs and Weird Al ' s album ? __label__0 I have posted a question at <url> which you may be able to answer. Can you please return to that discussion to answer it ? __label__0 I assume you are using NPI to refer to a problem in NP not known to be NPC ? Also, in the reference to Ladner, do you perhaps mean that L is NPC, and the removal S is NPI ?__label__0 I ' m not really sure what you ' re looking for that pinvoke . net doesn ' t provide. Can you cite an example where it didn ' t give you what you needed ? __label__0 Thanks; what should I do next time to make it easier, quicker? Just let you know ? __label__0 @ring0: Good idea ! Is there a way to do so ?__label__0 Although I have yet to understand what some of your maps mean, they are superb! Have you ever considered professional cartography ? __label__0 Also, on re - reading your question it is not clear what you mean by "minimum eigenvalue initial correlation matrix".

Is your company makes it for the employees or at school or may be you own initiative to learn Scala and take exam ? __label__0 I ' d be shocked if no one has asked you this yet, but you do an enormous amount of work keeping the bio articles free of vandalism and nonsense as well as filling them up with useful content ;) You seem like you could use a few extra buttons on your toolbar.

I had some difficulties with WP in general a couple of days ago and was wondering if your issues had the same origin ? __label__0 @Gilles Sorry for touching such an old issue, but it looks very interesting!

Could you confirm the problem is solved ? __label__0 Do you mean the launcher? Could you please provide a screenshot ? __label__0 Yes, the edges are always axis aligned (I will update the post). Could you give more detail on the scan line approach? Thx . __label__0 How about this: "Probably a lot, I had better get started (pull out a pad and pencil) What will you be eating for dinner tonight? (start writing) Okay, well I better get on the phone to find out about everyone else, what is the long distance code for your phones?"__label__0 Assuming the original pronunciation uses [s], I think there ' s a more interesting question: why are English speakers using [z] instead?

So, how do you know when the lines need to be combined ? __label__0 I noticed you ' re setting up s - line for DART but having trouble with the termini.

Can you add categories also ? __label__0 Sorry I didn ' t mentioned it, but it ' s tab separated.. It is possible to quickly replace the ',' by a '.' in the code or do I have to replace it with notepad++ or something ? __label__0 I ' d be more than happy to :) It may take a while as I ' ve got other stuff on, but as long as you ' re in no immediate hurry all should be well. Do you have any preferences / requirements for the end result ? __label__0 I removed a few obvious links on <url>, but wasn ' t sure about some of the others (sparknotes, paperstarter, etc) and couldn ' t find anything yea or nay on their use..if you have a few spare minutes (ha!), could you take a look ? __label__0 It ' s not too late to help at all - being busy has kept the work on it to a crawl. ;) I ' d like to represent what you are referring to; was it on the Abom talk page or somewhere else ? __label__0 @joelt -- good point, which I think is the ultimate debate going on now by the answerers below, but I would like to know (@everyone) how much of a difference is it at the beginning until they converge? How significant is it to affect the resulting algorithm ? __label__0 Great question, but I ' m not sure stackoverflow is the right place to ask it.

Did you let Jayjg know as well ? __label__0 I tried to make some improvements to the article. What do you think ? __label__0 My brain has been scrambled a bit by your sentence: "Essentially there is no way to distinguish between an object at rest or moving at a constant velocity." - can you elaborate please ? __label__0 Due to certain Edits the page alignment has changed. Could you please help ? __label__0 Thanks @BMitch, would you suggest the spray insulation (sorry not sure of the correct term). Or would that be too compact and not work for sound proofing ? __label__0 You are very welcome. Isn ' t it great we can all create a better world ? __label__0 After having collected some users willing to come, I created <url> subpage. Would you be so kind and add your ideas ? __label__0 Sorry if this is obvious, but what is `dn`? Is that a constant multiplied by `n`?__label__0 ^^ Yes it is very much for my self learning. Can you please guide me as to how to go about with the approach ? __label__0 I saw you put images for the Kings of Bhutan and thank you. Could you find an image to use for <url> also ? __label__0 It could simply be that the previous owner of your domain had questionable content. Did you dig wayback / cache to check ? __label__0 I can assist you with your sockpuppet report against him. :) Will you like me to just fill it out for you ? __label__0 PS I am planning on starting an article on ''<url>'' (<url>).

I see you are in Belgium, any chance of adding more pictures to the various lists ? __label__0 I ' m sorry, I ' m having trouble understanding your question. Could you try again ? __label__0 Thanks for the redactions :).

Any ideas why this might be happening ? __label__0 Hope that you don ' t mind, I modified your comment in the Craig intro, using a nice new template that I found. Check it out: what do you think ? __label__0 ww - hey, good work on the new pages that you ' ve added in the last couple of days (5 - 6 isn ' t it?). I add them to <url> when I notice them, but I ' m not sure that I catch them all; I don ' t suppose you could add them to the list on creation ? __label__0 Thanks, though. This was a much more interesting question than "how do you make a positive number negative in C#?"__label__0 There are many factors that influence the layout and size of an ImageView. Are you able to share the layout file ? __label__0 Thank you ''very much'' for partaking in my effort to have a listing of stable article revisions.

I think you meant RFC 2821 ? __label__0 @spinning _ plate - These are useful links. Do you know by any chance if parallelizing the computation will speed up the processing and if so how can a graph traversal problem like this be broken down into smaller pieces computable on numerous machines ? __label__0 Thank you, Cremepuff22, for the kind words. :) How have you been ? __label__0 I seem to have adopted this article, since country music and dance are interests of mine. Can you recommend an easy to use bot that would help me in keeping those unwanted links out of the article ? __label__0 While editing the COIN page regarding Ciplex, I accidently broke your sig. Since I don ' t want any more flame, could you please fix it ? __label__0 I just thought that it is nice when you are looking for RQ that you can find an algorithm that will do RQ, not QR. It ' s fine if we just make a section about RQ in the QR article, is that ok with you ? __label__0 i want to insert data whole data of array into vector of a map without using for loops. is it possible to push back data set into vector of map ? __label__0 Hi Thunderbrand, thanks for letting me know that the image I uploaded is on IFD. Can I ask though, why is the image being deleted ? __label__0 I agree, The question is almost claiming that you can ' t debug with a debugger in an IDE this is not the case. You can run a debugger with or without an IDE, I ' m sure he knows that though :) Maybe he is asking about visual debuggers specificly ? __label__0 You ' ll need to be more specific about your example in (c). What are complete sentences / contexts that you use one of these two phrases, and why is one closer to German ? __label__0 Nice.. you have almost give us enough details, last question. What is that `System . out . println ( e . getCause().toString());` call printing ? __label__0 yep :-) sorry for the confusion. any other ideas ? __label__0 Thank you for the response on my user page. Would you be willing to add a few words to the FAC candidacy ? __label__0 Should be "expect" instead of "respect". And also, please see my added question "Do I have to know about Escher and Bach?"__label__0 Thank you. Do you have any tips on the Kathy Dunderdale article to improve it ? __label__0 I think we ' re not going to convince each other today. Thank you for the enjoyable debate :) Should we just agree to disagree for now ? __label__0 I just put a table in for the novel villains (to put the novels and films on the same level), but it ' s kind of messed up (I know presscious little about tables on Wikipedia).

What do you think, substantively ? __label__0 I ' ve got a million files of log with sequentially updated numbered timestamps, but same filesizes for some.

Would you mind if I linked to it from my collection of "Useful things" on my user page ? __label__0 Thanks from me, too &mdash; cheers! I don ' t suppose you could put copyright and source information on those images, though ? __label__0 Thanks for protecting this. Perhaps no longer needed ? __label__0 Thanks Chris. Appreciate the prompt response. Would I need to add any cleanser after physically removing it ? __label__0 Hey, I just noticed that you are NOT an administator, I had always assumed that you were. I wondered if you would be interested in being nominated ? __label__0  " Google says they generally don ' t like pages with more than 100 links on them" -- out of curiosity what is your source on this? can you cite it in the post in a hyperlink ? __label__0 Could you please state your initial problem at what you are trying to achieve. Also please explain what do you mean by graphing interactions, graphing the different regression lines, plotting the coefficient values ? __label__0 You try thinking of algorithms (either new ones or ones you know) that satisfy the constraint, discarding the ones that don ' t. :-) Do you have specific examples ? __label__0 Thank you for the rollback. Does it appear in <url> or only in the history ? __label__0 Hi there, I ' ve raised the possibility of unprotecting the tamazepam page <url>. What are your thoughts ? __label__0 Good advice, @Spacedman. Care to write that down in a form of an answer so I can upvote you ? __label__0 Thanks for the response. May I ask, are you a video gamer ? __label__0 Hey, I could really use your skill on WikiProject Cities. Do you have time to assist ? __label__0 Hello Narendra. What is your question, exactly ? __label__0 I ' m afraid I don ' t understand what you are asking. Could you perhaps try to explain it in another way ? __label__1 Can you please post the some sample code . To which panel you are adding this horizontal panel ? Is there any spacing between the widgets added in the horizontal panel? or space is there on left side of whole horizontal panel ? __label__1 xD if you say so! By the way, what ' s your favorite game ever ? __label__1 Interrobang has asked me if I would also help mentor you when he is not around. I said that I would gladly help out if it was ok with you ? __label__1 Can we see the function that creates the output? And the output itself ? __label__1 I cannot see a problem with this. Do you get a completely blank cell of a missing image icon ? __label__1 I am not a statistics expert. Could you please explain more about the plotting idea ? __label__1 Nope, it ' s not in violation of anything, but it would certainly be useful for other images, I ' m sure. Also, I may have a few uses for it; would you mind sharing it under a public domain license or a Creative Commons license ? __label__1 I ' ve started an article called <url>. Would you be able to do a good intro paragraph ? __label__1 I tried to use logcat, but there ' s so much data provided I don ' t know how to sort through it. would you like all of the data ? __label__1 Thanks. As an aside, since this did turn out to be factual, just very hard to source, do you think the community would countenance an unblock request from Blaabla if he accepted some strict unblock conditions (such as packing in the 'systemic bias' thing, discussing his edits in a less confrontational manner etc)?__label__1 1. Need table definition, data in the tables, etc 2. What have you tried so far ? __label__1 Hi Mic, you changed <url> with a comment of "Conforming to header format". Where can I get the standard header format ?__label__1 Sorry, I didn ' t know. I added a tag, are you able to delete it ? __label__1 I ' m strongly considering closing this as a duplicate of [Taking it to the next level](http://cooking . stackexchange . com / q / 10317 / 41) which was itself a duplicate of [Books that explain the science of cooking?](http://cooking . stackexchange . com / q / 9657 / 41). Anyone have any comments on what distinguishes this one from the others ? __label__1 @Binary: Enough of you seem to be pretty upset about this - so I made it CW (which I didn ' t know about before, BTW) - do I need to do anything else? Or am I kosher now? :)__label__1 Thanks, this was easier to understand. Can you please add a few more lines to last three definitions ? __label__1 You beat me to the punch with the archaeological discovery.<url>. I ' m curious, do you know if any Scottish newspapers reported it ? __label__1 Actually, it worked locally but then did not work live on the site. On the site it is still saying "Access Denied" even if calling the jQuery file from the same domain / subdomain combination.. any thoughts ? __label__1 Are you trying to create some type of tile system, or are you just wanting to draw different parts of the image at a time. What are you using it for ? __label__1 Are you working on D2009 or later, i . e. are you working with string=ansistring or with unicode strings ? __label__1 What do you have so far? How are you storing what you get out of Nokogiri ? __label__1 Great answer. Is it enough for the jam to reach 220??F or does it need to stay there a while ? __label__1 It does seem a bit weird. You weren ' t doing it on a secondary thread by any chance ? __label__1 You liked my edit? Are there any other climate pages in New Jersey that need help ? __label__1 Is this happening in development only? Is it possible that class reloading is the issue as classes are not cached in development if you are adding methods during execution the class could be reloaded without your newly defined methods ? __label__1 I restored 3 non - piped blue links. How does that look ? __label__1 Problem is how do you recognise the categories, as there are thousands of them. I have already made a program that scans the database, and can locate the unstubbed articles, so finding the untagged stubs is ok, and AWB automatically adds the stub tag if the article is short, I just can ' t think how you could program it to automatically guess the type of stub, any ideas ? __label__1 Sure AGK. Does the draft need to be updated to include the tweaks ? __label__1 You may want to define efficient / clean. Do you mean simplest in terms of expression, or efficient in terms of processing speed, or most generic in terms of possible strings handled .. ?__label__1 By the way: Do you know how to remove the spaces created below the project banner when others are placed below it? And how to make capitalisation of the rating not matter ? __label__1 Is the set of points fixed? Will you fetch the closest 100 points for several differents locations, before set of points changes ? __label__1 I see the dilemma with separate series.. in the case with (untranslated) Spirou there are no such problems, but it seems to make more sense, with no english publication, to switch the brackets for english and original titles (ex: <url>). Does this create a problem with continuity ? __label__1 @Zoozy: As Andrew asked, What led you to this problem? What are the practical uses of such a sequence ? __label__1 Needs more context. Can you provide the question which precedes the answer too ? __label__1 could you give us more information about /Yesterday / Yesterday ? IS this a regular folder or a symlink ? __label__1 Sorry. How much reputation is needed to add a picture ? __label__1 I ' m a StatEt user, but I ' m not aware of a debugger built into Statet. Do you mean the debugging tools built into core R or some other aspect ?__label__1 Thanks. Any idea how I log into this account ? __label__1 Wow, that thing looks awesome! Is it quick / easy to attach ? __label__1 Hello, thank you for adding interesting content to <url> <url>. Are you able to provide <url> that will help the content meet our "<url>" standard ? __label__1 Do you know how to make the 'All Star Template' appear only at the bottom, as well as the 'Confirmed future sites', so the actual table appears at the top of the page??__label__1 Christian, could you please provide a reference for the recipes that you have seen / tried? What do you want to use the syrup for? Is this a syrup to sweeten your coffee or a coffee and caramel syrup for desserts ? __label__1 Thanks terribly for looking it up. Would it be alright for me to use the new source in Europe, economy section then ? __label__1 While it is possible to weld frames together - witness [this tall - bike frame](http://ww . flickr . com / photos / neilfein / 4653212878 / in / set - 72157624042376181) - I ' m going to guess that the stresses on a tandem would require some rather heavy reinforcement, making for an extremely heavy tandem frame. Can someone confirm or deny this ? __label__1 Thank you for your answer about Illustrator. How does Adobe Illustrator compare with InDesign ? __label__1 Hi SKS, I saw your post on the discussion on the charts page about Billboard Korea and I clicked the link and the website seems to be up and running but I can ' t make sense of it. Can you have a look at it ? __label__1 Good catch. Do we have a solution for that yet ? __label__1 Do you think <url> warrants instant removal?

Could you please add your comment as an answer ? __label__1 Do you have any module that changes the menu? May you provide a list of installed modules ? __label__1 I see you deleted the Shayla LaVeaux article, citing copyright problems.

Can you elaborate on this please, or refer me to a suitable link ? __label__1 Are the warped spots reachable from the doorway? If so, could you use a bent - nose pliers to straighten the track ? __label__1 Some prof once told me that 1N400x ' s are all made the same, just graded differently based on how they turn out. Not sure how much I believe that, but if you look at [some datasheets](http://ww . diodes . com / datasheets / ds28002 . pdf) all specified parameters are the same except Vr and only two different capacitances (maybe they just make 1N4004 and 7 ' s?)__label__1 Hi Serith - sorry, my question was badly worded - I ' ve amended it now.

Does COBOL really parse the expression as `foo != (11 or 12)`?__label__1 The answers all assume a different type of output.

In what language are you looking for a library ? __label__1 Furthermore, I ' ve heard something about ''FE'' trading cards.

Perhaps add another paragraph listing some of the smaller museums ? __label__1 Does the application run ok locally when you ' re not trying to debug? Do any other web apps allow you to debug ? __label__1 @freiheit: Thanks for the answer. Where can I get these items? Can I get some of them combined (whichever I want to have) or do I have to buy separately each of what I need ? __label__1 The commenter is merely saying that the solutions hard code the "multiples of three and five" conditions.

What ' s the article ? __label__1 Hello, sorry I probably should have asked first, but I thought it might be a good idea to nominate one of the images you uploaded, <url>, for featured picture. I hope you don ' t mind me taking the liberty, as it were ? __label__1 This happens for me, too, but only on my dev machine. Did you ever find an explanation ? __label__1 Sounds good. Could you drop Fritzpoll a note ? __label__1 Can you remember any other specific ingredients that might differentiate it ? __label__1 Your algorithm would presumably conclude that `{x , y , y , y , y}` and `{x , x , x , x , y}` are equal.

What do you think ? __label__1 With the detail you ' ve given that sounds OK to me, though you should note that MAC addresses can be changed / spoofed, so I guess it ' s a risk based on how tech - savvy / desperate your client is.

I wonder if you know of any way, or could suggest any way, that I could get to see the downloaded pdf of Newcomb vol . 6 ? __label__1 While this is obviously possible, it is far from trivial if you want it to look decent. Can you maybe get away with having several pre - rotated tower images and flip between those ? __label__1 Is it always the same for every file, or does it vary between files?

Perhaps though you could also make a list of kings on that page??__label__1 To answer your last question, you want to use `extern "C"` to prevent the name - mangling. Not sure about the first one yet though; have you verified that you ' re actually being sent any messages ? __label__1 I ' m sure that this is not a useful place to discuss the merits of your topic ban, which I think would need a wider audience to overturn.

Did you check out <url>?__label__1 Hypothetically, if course A and course B each have max size of 1, and five people list preference of AB, three people won ' t get into either preference.

Is there something specific you ' re having trouble with, or do you need ideas of where to start ? __label__1 I ' ve had usb debugging mode enabled since this fix was first mentioned and other than the annoying missing driver popup from Windows when I plug it in, I ' ve not noticed amy adverse effects. Why do you need to toggle it on and off ? __label__1 Note however that <url> does not exist. Which page were you talking about in this case ? __label__1 Depends on your OS.

Can you confirm that ' s happening ? __label__1 From the edit history to the template, it appears that your last edit has not been undone so hopefully this issue is resolved.

Can you post that log ? __label__1 <url> posted a wonderful grammatical analysis of the "has / had" thing, another editor agreed, so I ' m thinking we should make another request for the change, using Bluewave ' s post as the basis. What do you think ? __label__1 Is it possible you have an error in your [`remove _ action`](http://codex . wordpress . org / Function _ Reference / remove _ action) and [`add _ action`](http://codex . wordpress . org / Function _ Reference / add _ action) call? Your second parameter is `'show'`, but shouldn ' t it be the function you are adding or removing ? __label__1 Sorry, I was wondering if the are related to each other or separate organizations? Also is there a difference between North Twillingate and Twillingate ? __label__1 Given the screenshot, is it possible you have JavaScript that ' s interfering with the display of the form element ' s value?

Is this correct ? __label__1 Hi, I noted that you removed the caption of the image of the estate of Rozhdestveno that indicated that "Nabokov inherited the <url>- designed estate "Rozhestveno" in 1916."

That is, does it work if you just stick that line in while you ' re in dev mode ? __label__1 I was actually going to work on your suggestions today, regarding the GA nomination for <url>. Do you mind reopening the nomination ? __label__1 I don ' t really know the answer to this, but have you considered lowering the quality or decreasing the size of the image yourself? Maybe take the UIImage from the camera delegate event, scale it down and then save using UIImageJPEGRepresentation with a lower quality setting ? __label__1 Do the strings have the same lenght? Would padding all to the length of the longest one be a problem ? __label__1 Since in essence the nesting in a lmer makes it a repeated measures design is there a way in which your question about the appropriate confidence interval around the effect size is related to the question in repeated - measures ANOVA about which measure of effect size to report? Specifically, it is unclear whether the error term should include subject variance or not (etc)?__label__1 It didn ' t crash for me. What errors are you getting when it crashes ? __label__1 What do you mean with thickness? Moduli ? __label__1 What happens when you just use a different algorithm to determine file names?

Please can you give me a little bit more details about 'creating a custom admin page that allows the user to add static sections via AJAX with links to their edit pages' (if there ' s no Static Content menu in which other ways the user can create the content)?__label__1 It sounds like you are using some kind of survey engine. Are you, and if so which one ? __label__1 The reason for the malfunctioning redirects is that the character immediately after "REDIRECT" is not an ordinary space, but a "non - breaking space", hex code 0xA0. Out of curiosity: how did you manage to create them ? __label__1 @forcefsck I tried the exact steps as outlined in the answer, but got an error from Grub saying "could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device.". Please see the screenshots of it and my /etc / fstab, any other ideas ? __label__1 @Mikle - This question is too open - ended.

Mind if I nominate <url> at <url>?__label__1 I think if you were to consider the DAL as a seperate entity and imagine that it was your sole responsibility whilst all consumers was work done by a third party, you would probably raise an exception for Access Denied - most of the framework would. If however, you want to avoid _exception logic_ it would be helpful to provide functions to help the consumers determine if they have sufficient access to data - though that sounds like more of a business logic issue, which is it that controls the access ? __label__1 I am willing to try to discover the problem. What browser do you use ? __label__1 What if you added a button to the results page to go back to the form? Or wouldn ' t that overcome the users' urge to use the 'back' button ? __label__1 Good idea.

How goes ? __label__1 Oh I can explain how for you. Do you have a <url> computer ? __label__1 I ' m kind of afraid to undo <url>, mainly because I have doubt in whether the nihongo template is necessary at all. Thoughts ? __label__1 Im in Mac OSX, so I guess it ' s working as it ' s supposed to. Is there a way to change this ? __label__1 Yea - I deleted my line numbers request comment when I read the log again - I was on completely the wrong track with that! However, I still would consider the xib a suspect - it might be NSDecoding properties that don ' t exist anymore in the class ? __label__1 Sure it ' s possible. Do you have any prior experience in Python ? __label__1 can you describe the problem with your first approach more clearly? what is the meaning of "elements with close statistical probability of selection" and "distant selection percentages"?__label__1 Oh, okay. <url> should be placed as a "see also" on <url>, correct ? __label__1 I ' m currently considering nominating you for adminship at <url>. Are you interested ? __label__1 After rereading the second code fragment, I changed my assumption to O ( N) * O ( N - 1) instead of O ( N) * O ( N+1) because the nested loop gets iterated one less time than the first loop, is this correct?

Some people need more relaxation than others or they will drop dead. *(Chest pains anyone?)*__label__1 I recommend the [$0 . 5M 1THz Agilent VNA](http://cp . literature . agilent . com / litweb / pdf / 5989 - 7620EN . pdf). £1~$1070, right? :D__label__1 yes that should be possible. I ' d have to build some UI based on some javascript library and then some custom php integration to save the preferences in drupal database then ? __label__1 Well i would do that but i don ' t know how to. Maybe you can show me on thizs example please ? __label__1 That is why I suggest the following: either we refer to him as u201cSouth - Netherlandishu201d (like he is described on the Dutch Wikipedia page) or we omit the nationality completely and we just mention the cities he lived in.

Where abouts do you play ? __label__1 What operating system? Are you writing a debugger or trying to use a debugger ? __label__1 Your top picture shows two white plastic tabs with the one on the right looking like it is not engaged and pushed into the frig.

It ' s a strange hobby, isn ' t it ? __label__1 I think it ' s a great idea to get the CO3 community involved with keeping <url> correct and uptodate. I shan ' t be there myself this year (clashes with various things) - would you be able to bring it up ? __label__1 I moved ''Engine Arm Aqueduct'' to <url>, because there seemed to be much more content about the canal than the actual <url>. Does that seem reasonable, to you ? __label__1 Not sure I ' m reading the question correctly. So each user books a cottage ( s) 60 times a year ? __label__1 That should work.

No servers are being mentioned ? __label__1 @Michael No it doesn ' t have to be jpeg based, but it needs a significant compression ratio as the reason we want to do compression is to significantly reduce the amount of data transferred.

Are you asking for an existing module that is not Views, or are you asking how to do it with a custom module ? __label__1 That ' s..pretty cool, actually. Would love to see this with a harder tire, though. Do you have manufacturer ' s ordering information ? __label__1 I see you ' ve just placed a deletion request on your user page, but this page has no history and hasn ' t been edited previously. Did you mean to place it on the article you created, <url>?__label__1 It looks like you tried to file a checkuser case but you never created the subpage. Do you need some help ? __label__1 Have made some comments on your list, looks pretty good overall, my points are just picky ones! Any chance you could return the favour and have a look over <url> for me ? __label__1 |style="vertical - align: middle; padding: 3px;" | I ' ve started the Badfinger wiki amd I need help.

If so, how did it work out for you ? __label__1 As I ' ve only ever tagged one page for speedy deletion before (and that was an obvious cut - and - paste copyvio), I just want to make sure I tagged it properly. Was db - 1 the right tag for <url>?__label__1 That does sound odd. Is there perhaps a threshold setting of some sort ? __label__1 Thanks. Anything else ? __label__1 The <url> disambiguation page seems to be a model for collecting the related entries for IOOF buildings in a single place.

Would you be interested in reviewing <url> for its GA nomination ? __label__1 Depends, do you want it to actually respond to commands?

It claims to be the "Starting point for the program" -- is a call made from `__main__` that returns the return code of this function ? __label__1 Hmm..the picture was taken on my camera by someone else. To whom does the copyright belong ? __label__1 I think that the standards should not apply to animated pictures like ''Tintin'' where start of production is a fuzzy limit. After all, do we have proof that the production of ''<url>'' or ''<url>'' is more advanced than the one of ''Tintin'' ?__label__1 I never programmed that up because there were so few portal reviews, far fewer even than portal candidates. How often does this happen ? __label__1 Fire rating is usually measured in minutes. Do you have an idea of how long you want to contain a fire ? __label__1 Thanks. Beer ? __label__1 No, I ' m not aware of that. Which two articles ? __label__1 Hi, I borrowed your bit on Rauls Razor for my userpage. I hope thats okay ? __label__1 Just tested on IE8 Win7, it works! Does it reports some errors ? __label__1 It ' s going to depend (to a large degree I would have thought) on the climate. Where are you ? __label__1 I ' m inclined to agree with Pavel. Maybe change it to "What tech purchase has best improved your life as a programmer" or something ? __label__1 yes you are right I guess the problem is really whats happening around release, (I just wanted to ask if this is fine to do). Actually it ' s related to cocos2d before release I am making a CCAction and I have a CCSprite *sp, I am simply doing [sp runAction : anim]; while the animation is running I am releasing it, though nothing happens to the animation visually but is it right ? __label__1 What do you think? Is there a mistake somewhere ? __label__1 How do you pass the design into jasper? Is it doable to have two designs depending on the option selected ? __label__1 I have looked back in my archives a year, and cannot find the issue concerned - although I certainly remember the name, your account, and the style.

Can sources be added to verify the achievements ? __label__1 I am not sure, its a Google interview question, I saw it initially at http://ww . careercup . com / question ? id=7263132 .. It feels like that the question meant worst - case time bounds. Does it seem impossible ? __label__1 there is no good way to do this in general. Are there any conditions that you can give ? __label__1 Instead of deletion, I ' m considering simply redirecting Ponystars to <url>. Any objections ? __label__1 Great question. Could you clarify what you mean by "uniform": do you want to bound the amount of preprocessing of the parameter ? __label__1 Maybe you are using an extremely old version of jQuery or the script is built weirdly. Are you getting any error messages ? __label__1 Good day. Can look at this report please <url> ?__label__1 Could you please give an example of the action names .

Is that ok ? __label__1 are you on a linux / unix machine, maybe using cygwin? then have you tried the "file" command on a file ? __label__1 This doesn ' t seem off topic to me.

Should we start preparing for it now just in case the GA reviewer notices that something significant is missing ? __label__1 I ' m happy to help! After all, what ' s the point of acquiring knowledge about a process if I don ' t use that knowledge to help others ? __label__1 i searched through the history and the question at http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Talk : Telephone _ numbering _ plan # coincidence . 3F relates to infomation <url>. could you possiblly answer it ? __label__1 before I compose my answers to your questions, could you please explain what you mean by *"Lay a new thin layer of **gyps** (or some other material)"?* Also, would you be opposed to the new "concrete" screed layer being your finished balcony surface ? __label__1 Please could show the variant with alignat* too? (align both relation symbols and equation numbers)?__label__1 Why is it an HTML file? Also can you please show the JSON ? __label__1 @Neil All data is input onto a screen before so there is no actual input data. Would it help if put the whole program here ? __label__1 That ' s OK &mdash; I just wondered if you had a new translation that used "on". Where are you studying philosophy, by the way ? __label__1 This is probably more of a timing issue than anything else. Can you provide some information as to the actual application of this to whatever you ' re doing ? __label__1 Advice please (or do I approach my adopter about this?). I am tempted to put in the RN article that Lynn once appeared in a Leonard ad with the caption: 'Who else would listen to me bitch?" (I could try and find the issue where the ad appeared), but although relevant to the article, I suspect this could be seen as puffery, considering I started the article ? __label__1 Good shot of Danica ' s car qualifying at Japan. Were you able to see her win the race ? __label__1 Could I now rewrite the current <url> article to be primarily about the comic, with a small section mentioning that a future film has been announced?

I was wondering if you could populate them ? __label__1 Glad to see that link go blue. Have you seen the <url> on Google Books ? __label__1 I apologize if I have misunderstood.

Would it be OK to move the timeline to a template, so that all the Mars - related geology pages can point to the same timeline, making updates easier ? __label__1 The "standard work" on Introduction to.. articles is presently <url>, maybe you could add your thoughts as some kind of appendix / discussion? I don ' t know what the procedure is for essays, single author of Wiki - style ? __label__1 Are you using an IDE in your group? Like Eclipse or Netbeans ? __label__1 @Peter Shor: Of course. Doesn ' t everyone ? __label__1 Doing it under the guidance of the relevant <url> would be a good idea as the folks that are active in the project will be best placed to advise on which templates and styles fit in with the rest of the project.

Can you illustrate what you mean by 'modular configuration', preferably by means of an example ? __label__1 Are you a professional illustrator, or an aspiring one? Where might I have seen your work ? __label__1 Same with the vandal over at <url>.

And what do you call debug mode ?__label__1 its - it ' s - its - Sheesh ! Thanks for fixing :-) Scary, huh ? __label__1 I see you ended the AfD on <url> and removed the tag.

What specific connection class are you using ? __label__1 Hi, Michael David. Was there any consensus reached on this issue ? __label__1 Could you please elaborate that? Does it work as I think: you append the databases, then use scan>check duplicates ?__label__1 You assume correctly; same principle would apply. :-) By the way, is there a trick to getting the (Talk) link in your signature automatically that I haven ' t learned yet ? __label__1 I think there are specs shown on the Vexilla Mundi website, if that helps. Are you happy for me to bring other such flags to your attention ? __label__1 Can you please provide a simple sample Haml file and the output you want to get?

Can we discuss these edits before imposing them, please ? __label__1 So, the canvas was causing the move to upper left, but removing the canvas still has one of the classes assuming it knows better where to place images, and it ' s letting me push them outside the bounds of the control. Any suggestions ? __label__1 sorry my bad english , its not what i ws looking for becuase everything i would have to include a shortcode after more tag in the post editor, but it can do that work. So its not possible to just work on some function which will automatically put some text / code after the more tag in the post page ?__label__1 I posted here rather than to Jon ' s page because I don ' t want to embarrass the students; I know Jon watchlists your page and I am sure other NRG editors do too. Anyway, what do you think ? __label__1 How lay are we talking about here? Do you have some knowledge of Galilean dynamics and Newtonian mechanics ? __label__1 can show your app please ? Are you looking for something similar to this http://mrdoob . com / projects / harmony ??__label__1 scheme is pretty easy to debug. What step does the stepper stop you at ? __label__1 If all you want is just to make money, you ' d better stay off from programming. How about becoming a popular actress ? __label__1 David Sprenkle was at the University of Illinois in 1982 (at least part of it) while I was there. Were you there too ? __label__1 Usually you ' d specify language in the tags (for example, HTML, CSS, PHP, etc.) What language are you using ? __label__1 Sorry for the late reply, but I usually check new additions from the bottom of the page, not the top. What is your disappointment regarding ? __label__1 agreed, but i am not seeing the checkbox. are you able to wiki - fy it? thx__label__1 Yes, sorry I didn ' t see the discussion. How about moving it to a subpage of <url>, say <url>?__label__1 You are correct Yi Jiang, we are only using HTML for his web developer. What do you mean when you refer to "If so, then why add all the weight of a rendering engine when you can do the same natively?"__label__1 Also - I just tested in chrome and it does exactly as I said above. No resize handles around the image when it is placed in the containment div and as soon as you click the image it jumps directly into the containment div - there is no smooth drag animation..?__label__1 Right, the workstation is a VM running 64 bit with VS installed and I ' m attmepting to debug to the local dev.

Hey, can you please tell me if <url> has been fixed enough by being stub - ified ? __label__1 Posters are assuming you live in North America. Is this a valid assumption ? __label__1 I think the article needs work. For example, I think "U . S. late 1980s - 1990s" should after "Detroit sound." "UK 1990s" should after "U .

Is this correct ? __label__1 I think I lot of the things on the Methuselah page are very interesting, but perhaps should be transferred to the Biblical Generations article, if they touch on more than just Methuselah.

Which object is making this call in the first case ? __label__1 I wonder why this is not possible by default, probably because the categories usage didn ' t need that in the past. Have you considered to add a feature request in [wordpress trac](http://core . trac . wordpress . org/)?__label__1 Other than that I think the artical is ready to go. What say you ? __label__1 should pmf ( X) be the normalized frequency distribution of X? If yes, do we have any function in Matlab to compute it ? __label__1 Sorry, but I fail to see any correspondence between the title and the actual question in the body.

Do you want me to semi - protect them (your subpages) so that it is more difficult for vandals to subtly vandalize you ? __label__1 Hey MBK; well, I ' ve got to be honest I wasn ' t expecting the events of last night - personally I thought the discussion was going reasonably well (not fabulously, but we were getting somewhere) and, whilst I agree that Mlm ' s actions weren ' t exactly advised, I must admit it does seem to be a relatively minor thing to retire over - was there something else going on here that made it the straw that broke his back? Anyhow, I agree with you that he ' ll be greatly missed - I sent him a message on NSF but I doubt if I ' ll get any reply - what are your thoughts on the matter ? __label__1 If you need a command to do that, you better provide us at least with the language / package you use. Are we talking SAS, SPSS, Stata, SPlus, Minitab, R, .. ?__label__1 What do you mean? The best OS to do Arduino development on, or the best OS to run on your Arduino (a la FreeRTOS)?__label__1 Do you have any code we can look at?

Do you have any pseudo - code that you ' ve come up with on your own that others can comment on ? __label__1 I ' m afraid it ' s still unclear what you want to do with roomA and roomB.

Thoughts ? __label__1 I am having a hard time figuring out what each symbol means.

Is that right ? __label__1 I hope I don ' t upset anyone by jumping in univited, but why are self - created images any different than those found elsewhere so long as they comply with all of the non - free content criteria?

Rigid body physics)?__label__1 Is `A` a global variable? What is x ? __label__1 <person> - sorry about that, those situations are confusing. Maybe Twinkle uses, or behaves like, rollback ? __label__1 ErrorDocument 404 index . php This does not seem to work for me. Any ideas ? __label__1 We have a <url> page on <url> which, we suspect, may be in Slovenian. Could you have a look at it (whether it is Slovenian and, if so, whether it is worth translating)?__label__1 I thing dev - tips like these should be tagged support, not discussion. (Maybe both?)__label__1 Do you mean article edits with sock puppets? Could you give me more precise examples ? __label__1 Ok. By the way, may I note that is an excellent resource you have there. I noticed the other day that we had acquired a list at <url> of unproduced scripts / stories - it seems entirely genuine and fits with material I have read elsewhere but was uncited - I wonder if you could help find a source for it ? __label__1 Ah, I see. Although surely Aaron Lennon was younger when he first played for England ? __label__1 I ' m expriencing the same thing. Did you resolve this ? __label__1 Could you clarify what you mean by "zoom?" Are you referring to the effects of `Ctrl +` and `Ctrl -`?__label__1 Indeed it should be automatic.

Can you elaborate ? __label__1  ' prefab' really isn ' t a particular architectural style..it ' s a manufacturing process. Can you post a picture ? __label__1 +1 for the historical paragraph (please add reference?) but -1 for thinking that programmers should betray the established methodologies of those for whom they work ? __label__1 I ' ve had a problem like this where it would just try to find the image by path and not from the Route. Have you tried debugging to see if the application goes into the controller ? __label__1 Thanks for the poking tip! How long to cook ? __label__1 Could you post some of the relevant code? It would make it easier to figure out what is going on.. Also, what do you mean by "the Map"?__label__1 My question is "Why?" I am doing all the citations correctly and this still appears often. Can anyone tell me what I ' m doing wrong ? __label__1 I have an interesting proposal.. assuming the common tail of the list is infinitely long. How can you find the node intersection using constant memory ? __label__1 Also, what about duplicates? It ' s not explicit, but it seems like you want to remove them ? __label__1 I think, the point here is I should have checked for error when i am doing "ptr [ 0] = new char [ strlen ( psError) + 1];" This might be the reason that it is throwing error when i am trying to delete it later ? __label__1 @DSchultz Tried adding the 'ww' (no luck). How do I URL encode it ? __label__1 This is certainly a tough assignment if you aren ' t good at programming. Do you have to code your own quadratic programming optimization as well ? __label__1 Do you know how many pieces you have in total, in rows and in columns? Were they rotated ? __label__1 I know, but your question implied that you have conductive tape and want to know if it is conductive. Another good question might be, Is there a conductive tape product and then have details in the question about what you need specifically ? __label__1 Perhaps showing some more of your code would help us help you? Also what the file hierarchy look like for relevant files ? __label__1 Would you be okay if I seconded your nomination? Or would you prefer me to add as a "support"?__label__1 I have found a better citation for reference 7, but am not sure how to insert the page number (p. 97 from the book cited).

Can you take another look at the nom ? __label__1 I think your best option would be to redesign so that you don ' t have to do this. What is this design intended to accomplish ? __label__1 Packets are being received by a program ("streamed" perhaps is a good word) that have a type of ACK, SYN, FIN, or any combination thereof. Essentially the question is, how can one detect when five different combinations have occurred ? __label__1 what happens if you print before exporting? or is that the order already ? __label__1 I apologise, I didn ' t actually see the message on my talk page, I assumed you meant the article talk page. If you are concerned that the "free" image has been uploaded under a false license, then perhaps you could nominate it for deletion ? __label__1 Can you post this somewhere with a live URL? I don ' t see a background image referenced in the CSS..?__label__1 Hello? Whom do I speak to to become a <url>?__label__1 <url> is, in reality, a good guy, and quite reasonable. I ' m confident that he ' d be happy to help work with you on any image problems -- remember how you and I started out editing together ? __label__1 Thanks for reverting <url> - that was actually me, unlogged in. OK if I re - revert ? __label__1 What is the full exception? Also, the bits you commented out, which actually iterate over the linq query, what does that look like ? __label__1 you can do this with a container that is positioned absolute / fixed with a width and height of 100%. background can then be set to `background - position: center center` I think ? __label__1 I object to the use of cats in the described manner. Can we change it to dogs ? __label__1 Great idea on the mixed meat. I ' ll give a 50 / 50 a try. BTW, isn ' t much sausage cured ground beef ? __label__1 You are correct that the science is not copyright, but the purpose of the cite is <url>. If I want to check your equation, where should I look ? __label__1 Since this person made a sincere attempt to discuss the page, and the page in his opinion was relevent, you can remove this warning from his talk page? In the spirit of <url>, perhaps ? __label__1 and @Nico: Have you tried my solution? Did it fix the problem ? __label__1 All, I have some ideas for Palm Springs meetup locations (just by looking on Yelp). Should I start a question in main or meta, add my locations as answers so people can vote and also add their ideas for meetup locations ? __label__1 Otherwise, very nice article. Are you going to submit it to DYK ? __label__1 @George, what ' s the key thing needed to make the widgets? And how do the wf_ functions work ? __label__1 sorry about that. Can it be done in python ? __label__1 Out of interest (I might check) .. do you know how the Australian Bureau of statitics classes / categories Australian Aborigines/ Aboriginal Australians??__label__1 I ' d love to help, but I ' m not sure what you ' re asking me to look at, specifically. Is there a discussion ongoing that you can point to ? __label__1 The large coat of arms is still be commented on. Maybe you can lend a word or two ? __label__1 Hope you had a good trip. Are you able to take a further look now ? __label__1 I ' ve heard you say you have quite a collection of dog books.

At the CLI ? __label__1 I have, and they have not responded in one week. How long should I give it ? __label__1 @Paul W they all just pass through, there ' s no getting off early. would you think it would be ok to change the initial call to somewhere further down the line to skip a few but use the main interface still ?__label__1 Should be a community wiki question then? There isn ' t a right answer, I believe ? __label__1 Which part are you having trouble with? Do you need help determining if there are new items, or do you need to know how to start an executable once you ' ve determined that there are new items ? __label__1 Ok then. DO you want to set up another Peer Review for <url>?__label__1 Hi Khoikhoi - I see you deleted a previous incarnation of a pan - Arabism article which seems to be resurfacing under variant names, and is now at <url>. This doesn ' t read to me like an encyclopedia article - do you have any thoughts on whether / under what criterion it should be deleted ? __label__1 WDM, the Homeopathy article is starting to stabilize. But just a thought, will an FAC cause it blow up again ? __label__1 Good! By the way, what do you think of merging the recurring animals in <url> to <url> and then getting rid of the rest ? __label__1 I did go through that post, but I was looking for option for both Windows and Mac. is it possible to do this via shell extension ?__label__1 That link isn ' t working for me. Can you check it ? __label__1 Are your buildings all rectangular? Or do they have more complex shapes ? __label__1 Hi, just noticed you reverted this page back to its pre - COPYVIO state.

Are we just more surprised by these two topics ?__label__1 Let ' s go back to what you want to add now while I find that notice.

Do you have an e - mail address I can use to get in touch with you ? __label__1 From my sources it seems that the Duke of York didn ' t have any radar when completed, but during her numerous refits different radar sets were added. So shall I list all the radar added from her refits ? __label__1 What FTP software are you use? What authentication methods ? __label__1 Unfortunately, I have no clue what you mean. Can you point me to a page that has such a feature ? __label__1  ( sorry for delayed response) I think it would be difficult to intergrate them, my program would probably work more easily from a list of articles with typos generated from the database, with the spelling correction code built in to the program. While on the subject, are you planning on running Humanbot again soon ? __label__1 Has it crashed before? How often does it crash ? __label__1 @Curtismchale - To clarify, I think this question has two parts, one asking for an inexpensive heart - rate monitor, the the other asking about wrist - vs - chest mount units. @David, is this correct ? __label__1 Did you read the page linked to from that one? If so, which / what part ( s) didn ' t you understand ? __label__1 Could you better describe for which elements of jqGrid you what to set the background image?

What would be a better desciption for these historical Japanese soldiers ? __label__1 What kind of processing will you perform?

Is it just number of loads or urls or is there some callback info you want when the user is using your widget ? __label__1 Do you want to connect your wiki with other systems?

What do you think about that ? __label__1 Hey, I ' m inquiring about my <url> a few months ago for photos from the Flames - Rangers game that took place last week.

What ' s your question ? __label__1 This should also be tagged "regex", but only five tags are allowed.

Drop me an email sometime, ok ? __label__1 Hi, you have tagged the article <url> orphan. Can you please check it ?__label__1 hi Gabe what is your reason to activate the USB Debug with fastboot? why don ' t use Settings > Application settings > Development > USB debugging??__label__1 Would my doing a read - through looking out for that kind of thing be useful? Or would it be merely annoying ? __label__1 Ah.. Hmm. Would it be possible to wrap it in Jython somehow to make it a Java applet using the code I wrote ? __label__1 I messed with this problem a bit last week but couldn ' t come up with anything.

I have old code somewhere, untested for long time - want me to post it anyway ? __label__1 Ah, I see. If you don ' t mind, I ' ve more or less understood everything, but just wish to inquire about 2 things: (1) could you please explain the `$form _ state` variable a bit more; and (2) I ' m guessing that `$job _ node->field _ number [ 0]['value']` writes that value to the first webform field ? __label__1 Not imageView1 . image, imageView1.

Don ' t suppose you have a link..?__label__1 On another note, I ' m going to assume that you were the one who also added ridership data for various LIRR stations, am I correct?

Like in your examples or are you given a graph or something like that ? __label__1 Hi, the article states that Mongolian Cyrillic is a phonemic script. Is this so in respect to Inner Mongolian dialects ? __label__1 do you do dfs from every node? if not, what nodes do you begin the search from ? __label__1 It sounds (no pun intended) like you are looking for some sort of shock sensor (accelerometer) to detect the impact of the kick. The problem that I see here is how do you limit the impact detection to just the kick event and not detect the impact of the foot / boot on the ground ? __label__1 @dmckee - I wasn ' t aware that a closed question could be edited. Will an edited closed question generally get reconsideration ? __label__1 I took a quick look and I ' m not up to reading through it properly at the moment. :) I ' ll be back on here tomorrow morning and I ' ll have a look then, if that ' s OK ? __label__1 Thanks for the good advice. I still think the electric - shock - button idea is a good one though :-) You been having problems with images as well ? __label__1 Shouldn ' t this be a community wiki? It doesn ' t have a clearly correct answer ? __label__1 Is it for a particular CPU (e . g. a Z80 or the Cell processor ' s SPU) or for some abstract CPU ? __label__1 Chances are, this doesn ' t exist. Also, language ? __label__1 I ' ve created <person> to deal with the new CSD A8, deletion of blatant copyvios.

Just out of curiosity, is a site preference for color over black and white explicitly indicated on some guideine or policy page ? __label__1 I do understand the bot was approved and is doing useful job, but. Is it possible to modify it to not save the changes if it is only one - two whitespace ( s)?__label__1 We are working on adding some information regarding the significance of the podcast. Do you have any additional tips on improving out article ' s quality ? __label__1 Should be OK. Let me finish up what I ' m doing now, and then see what needs doing.

Is it possible for you to upgrade ? __label__1 @Mac: I ' d be interested in hearing more about that situation. Can you post it as a question, for us to solve the incompatibility ? __label__1 I have made changes to <url>. Is that acceptable ? __label__1 ""This waveform resembles a frequency modulated sinusoidal wave (only it is not)."" Is this a joke ? __label__1 This worked for me the other day. Are you sure it happens for EVERY site you try to post a link to ? __label__1 by "downloading by code" I meant downloading the picture bytes using a webservice and assigning it to the Image element. This could be the subject of another question, but what technique would you use to control the download sequesce by preserving the browser cache ? __label__1 absolutely correct!! UMM what is in the blue J - box on back side of the wall?? possible junction location for an extension wire??__label__1 I found <url> whilst looking for something else. Any use to you ? __label__1 However could you please comment the difference? And the problem with the former ? __label__1 Sorry, just realized you were talking specifically about using the word in the title, which does make things a little trickier-- you probably don ' t want your app to have a different name on both sides of the pond, although it wouldn ' t be unheard of. Can ' t you just use "Plane" instead? :P__label__1 If you can remember, would you mind giving a bit more information about this photo e . g. where you took it ? __label__1 Oh no! Is this related to the double roasted peppers from the salsa thread ? __label__1 Can you be more specific about how you want it to evaluate the logic? What should the code output ? __label__1 Thanks for your help on <url>. Any advice on edits we should make to get it up the quality scale ? __label__1 how much current is your power supply rated for? what are you using ? __label__1 Sorry its not clear but what are you considering for alternatives? Are you trying to decide between a desktop client and a web client or considering Winforms over WPF ?__label__1 @damonokz Sorry maybe I misunderstood something but you said "Anyway, its a relief that somebody understands the situation". So the guys here who are trying to answer your question and spending their own time don ' t understand the situation ? __label__1 Hey I saw that you ' re using Huggle and wanted to try it out, too. I downloaded it, but every time I try to open the program I get the message: CLR error: 8004005. The program will now terminate..What can I do to fix the problem ? __label__1 A clarification: Do you want generalisations in the sense that feasible solutions are matchings, but your objective function is different from the usual max - weight matchings (something like the case of stable marriages)? Or generalisations in the sense that feasible solutions are also some kind of generalisations or relaxations of matchings (something like independent sets or fractional matchings)?__label__1 Well, with 400 open files it also gets stuck, though later on, at around line 100, and then it progresses, though much more slowly. (I guess it has to do with the output buffering?)__label__1 Have you checked the actual SVN server to make sure the file was added? Did they Add and check in or just Add ? __label__1 I tried to address your concerns in the nomination page. Do you mind having another look ? __label__1 Do you know anything about the contents of the strings? Are they ASCII, for example ? __label__1 I was visiting the <url> article again today, and I had the same instinctive reaction to the image, that it is too specific and not representative of all pederastic relationships but only the sexual ones. Would you mind if I changed to something more representative of the practice, like a symposium image ? __label__1 I see. Was it talking about that one specifically? :)__label__1 Wouldn ' t the time complexity depend on the type of tree? Could you elaborate on that point ? __label__1 ok that was really confusing, I clicked on this link <url> and then cleaned the page but the page still exists, sso from what I understood if you put the ending "/double redirect" at the end of any article, you ' ll see how many redirects it has? is that right ? __label__1 I don ' t see you around much these days. Busy with non wiki life ? __label__1 The image is a little difficult to read. Can you add just the source of that DIV html to your question ? __label__1 Hey, I like your sharebox a lot. What do you think about trying to make it a <url>?__label__1 Is there any further information you ' ll need for a proper answer to this ? __label__1 Sorry, I can ' t see it.

What is the desired answer if `dictionary = {"abc", "bcd"}` and `word = "abcd"`?__label__1 Katy, good buddy. Is <url> your lost article ? __label__1 Are you hardcoding the node id in the "second" method but it won ' t load the node? Or is the question why you aren ' t getting that node id in the "second" method ? __label__1 Sure. I have to warn you, though, the file size advantage has pretty much been lost since SVG font rendering went the way of the dinosaurs :) Do you make a point of having the border, or can I leave it out ? __label__1 Thanks for explaining. Um, is that an official policy, or one just custom ? __label__1 I do not know how to merge them. Are you familiar with the process ? __label__1 My post above was a helpful hint about following DYK as a whole, not about the nomination process. Would you mind posting your post under a new heading, as it seems to have little to do with what I was saying and seems to be changing the subject ? __label__1 When I see status with Firebus ' s Net Tab then it shows me Status 200. Is it right ? __label__1 You could have forgotten an include that defined a type, forgotten a smicolon, lots of things. Can you paste the code 10 lines before and after the location that the error indicates ? __label__1 What have you tried? Where are you having difficulties ? __label__1 @Alan Good. Can someone verify for Debian (repositories don ' t have 5 . 12 . x), Mac OS X (MacPorts has 5 . 12 . 2), and Windows (ActiveState Perl 5 . 12 . 3)?__label__1 You ' re most likely using Visual C++, so it can ' t be a compiler bug since I ' m getting `C4430` errors for the second code snippet. Is there a `using namespace std` or `using std::string` in any of your header files ? __label__1 Are you sure it ' s WordPress autocomplete? Do you get a different result with a different browser ? __label__1 Your regexp is probably dropping the newline character that is present on each of your input strings.

Also is there a limitation on changing the framework ? __label__1 I ' m in Japan timezone - and at work now - and most IRC is totally blocked through work proxies.

Do you get some errors then ? __label__1 I don ' t understand what ' s wrong with the standard C pre - processor. Can you clarify ? __label__1 Matt H ' s comment covers the "how". As for "Is it legal?"..__label__1 Thank you for the links and the explanation.

And how do you consider javafx to be a replacement ? __label__1 Hi, I see you were involved in creating the ship infobox.

You wish to join all airports to all destinations ? __label__1 We still need more details: do you have your own SMTP server? Or are you using a gmail account for instance to send your mail through ? __label__1 To be honest, I ' m not sure - the decision say "remove individuals and organizations" but it also said "per BLP" and Abascal is deceased.

Does Smalltalk / X work as in interpreter until you compile ? __label__1 A photo might help. Into what does the vent screw ? __label__1 Please be more specific.

Do you think you could rephrase it ? __label__1 You were right that there was a problem, but I see Xn4 has now had a go at it. Perhaps you could look at it again ? __label__1 `ps -ef` shows all foreground processes for me. Which OS are you running on ? __label__1 Great job. Any chance of a full date of death for him ? __label__1 @Mgccl: Great that you found a better solution for your specific case. May I ask what you are doing this for ? __label__1 Thanks for the revert on <url>. Kinda curious how this blanking is always done by IPs that trace back to USAF installations isn ' t it ? __label__1 Thanks! To be absolutely fair his earlier edits to Rumble Fighter seemed serious; maybe he left the pc untended ? __label__1 Maybe the area that is now the Chakma Autonomous District Council was (or is?) located within the Lawngtali district ? __label__1 first thank you all for your answers second i cant understend jim why you think i try to make fun of you? and last how i mark that the problem solved ? __label__1 The FLC reviewing process is much slower than I imagined it would be but I suspect the Oscar nominees are bound to get promoted soon.

How does your sort need to function in the higher dimension ? __label__1 Just to clarify - your want to output the strings from the short text file, subtracting any strings from the short text file that are in the long text file?

What is the output you get and what is the output you expect ? __label__1 Any particular language in mind? Are you inserting this into an existing document, or creating a new one consisting of just the image ? __label__1 Btw, I ' ve issued a request for discussion on the Canadian Wikipedians' notice board about a dispute involving myself and another contributor on <url>. If you have a chance, could you look this over ? __label__1 I have some code that attempts to solve this problem (see above). Can you look over it and help me fix it ? __label__1 Also I noticed you made new Europe and USA maps for this and <url>. Do you think it would be good to have a world map for <url>?__label__1 Hello, I ' m a sysop in <url>, I ' m creating an Upload page like English Wikipedia <url>, I ' ve changed file MediaWiki : Licenses / vi - ownwork corresponding to Own work options, but they still display Media : Licenses information. Can you know what problem is ? __label__1 Just looking at that photo and the one in the article makes me feel cold :). I just finished this article <url> a week or so ago, and wonder if those Forward Operating Locations are tied into intercepts from those NORAD radar sites ?__label__1 I noticed you ' ve been adding the template <person> to pages - I ' m sure there ' s a good reason but I ' m totally puzzled as to why. Can you explain what it does ? __label__1 It appears that you deleted my comments and vote on <url>. May I ask why ? __label__1 I saw on the status page that you have a free spot. Would you be able to coach me ? __label__1 Yeah, and it will still have been the third to pass the full bit string tests, instead of just the byte tests. :) What ' s the significance of 2042 ? __label__1 I ' m not quite sure what is your question: (1) You want to produce a PDF file without embedding any fonts and you ' d like to know when this is "safe"? (2) You would like to make sure that all Latex users can compile your document without installing additional packages ? __label__1 Indeed, this is more applied mathematics than physics, though I ' m not sure it ' s a good enough reason to close this question. It ' s an odd question in any case; perhaps a little clarification would help? :)__label__1 I have indicated on <url> that, should you be desyopped, I will immediately re - nominate you for sysop. Would you accept the nomination if I did ? __label__1 @Luke: what programming languages are supported on your server on which this webpage with song+artist+album is hosted? Would you mind posting a link to that JSON data ? __label__1 @PeterAllenWebb - can you define 'Not in the list'.

Do you still need help or is this sorted ? __label__1 I have never seen anything which says that warning levels should begin anew each day. <url> says that warning templates "are listed at right in order of severity, but need not be used in succession." If there is another policy somewhere, could you show it to me ? __label__1 If this question isn ' t being moved to meta, can it be split? Move the stuff specifically related to this site to meta, and leave the rest here for general web use ? __label__1 just to verify, can you capture what the generated SQL looks like for a simple get like `Session . get ( SecurityContact . class, id)`, hql with `from SecurityContact where securityId = ?` and your left join attempt? Also, what version of Hibernate are you using ? __label__1 Where ' s your public key token for the assembly? Are you adding these manually to your config file or through the IDE ? __label__1 I agree with you in that this chapter has no place on <url>, moreover its inclusion there seems highly suspicious. Is there any way to see who added a particular word / sentence / paragraph without manually going through the history ? __label__1 Just a question about the maintenance categories that FemtoBot automatically creates each month: I ' ve noticed that the bot is frequently forced to recreate old, long - deleted monthly categories in the <person> queue, because an article got reverted to an old version for one reason or another and resulted in the old category being temporarily repopulated again. I ' m just putting this forward as an idea for discussion, and am certainly not wedded to it u2014 but just to keep things simpler for everyone, I wonder what you would think about the feasibility and / or desirability of recoding the bot so that when it encounters a repopulated old maintenance category, it would retag the article to the ''current'' month instead of recreating the old one ? __label__1 just out of curiosity, why would you want to wipe out all (but the absolutely necessary) fonts? Is it a disk space constraint ? __label__1 Well, that didn ' t take long. The Mac App Store was released, what, less than two hours ago ? __label__1 Aha, problem solved, while I was writing that, you set up a new article! Should we change <url> into a disambiguation page ? __label__1 showing some code would greatly help e . g. how did you declare 'path'?__label__1 Are you wanting to take all pairs of elements to be compared or is it that all the elements of the array are compared against a known value , e . g. if the array was of ints and you wanted to know if half were single digits ? __label__1 The proper title of this image should be Eszopiclone . svg, since it depicts the S enantiomer. Could you change the title so I can upload an image of the racemic compound instead ? __label__1 @kelton52, then the problem is at compile time rather than run time. There should still be behaviour, error messages from the compiler perhaps ? __label__1 And after seeing this talk page, I ' ll also note that there is no difference between scalars in math, physics and computing, those articles should all be merged together. :-/ Maybe you ' d be interested in doing such a merge ? __label__1 @Mat is there a NOP for oracle? how can I abort the statements from being executed from within the trigger ? __label__1 Just out of curiosity, how did you do the eye tracking? Are you open sourcing this code ? __label__1 I presume you have no access to the ESRI REST server / cannot make changes. Do you have rights to download and modify the data ? __label__1 A quick question, I ' d like your opinion on something. Do you think I should put <url> GAN on hold or fail it ? __label__1 Hi again! Per your <url>, I ' ll leave questions here, which actually leads me to a question, hehe; why would you want users to bring RfA discussion to your talk page rather than keeping it in a centralised viewable location on the RfA page where users are encouraged to submit questions for optional response by the candidate ? __label__1 ahh please this is so common its not even funny. Why do managers think that testing can be optional just cause their getting fire from above ? __label__1 I don ' t know about Eclipse, but Visual Studio puts it on the right - button menu. Perhaps Eclipse is the same ? __label__1 thanks , with prepopulate where do I modify the url ? __label__1 Hmm.. I ' m new here at Wikipedia and your explanation is a little cloudy..Should I delink the references website ? __label__1 So it seems we both already know the problems with the current logo and the SVG one. What can I do to help you ? __label__1 Please see <url>. Could you help with the list on the talk page ? __label__1 For those of us who aren ' t specifically familiar with `sendmail`, it might help if you post a more complete set of log lines, and describe exactly what details you ' re paying attention to when you do this manually. For example, in the line you ' ve posted, is `p937blksdh3` the message - id ? __label__1 Yes, but is "getting away" with it the best choice? What about ethics in GIS ? __label__1 This is the first time I ' ve heard of this. What is it ? __label__1 In addition to reformatting, can you try to provide some more info? Where are you stuck, what ' s going wrong ? __label__1 Hi, congrats on your admin promotion, but in preparing the short note about it for ''The Signpost'', I ' m puzzled as to "the backlog", which appeared in your RfA text. Is it a copyright backlog for images ? __label__1 I thought that it seemed a bit removed from Imlay ' s own time and there was no real explanation of the significance of Imlay to Twain (if any) or of Imlay ' s reputation between her death and the end of the nineteenth century or in America. What do you think ? __label__1 Please explain science behind "the darker the color of the metal of the muffin tin the more it will brown its contents" in relation to being in a domestic oven ? __label__1 So, what do you think of it? Interesting guy, isn ' t he ? __label__1 I think for #1 for sequential search the number is (n+1)/2. Is that right ? __label__1 Are you on development webserver? Check if the same problem present with your app working under IIS and then with new empty mvcapp ? __label__1 unfortunately I can ' t do that. can anyone help ? __label__1 I ' m see about the new Version 0 . 7 - which stated should FINALLY be published soon.. When the exact date it published? Is there anything that I can help ? __label__1 This user, whom you recently blocked, has persisted in using both his user and user talk pages for repeat personal attacks. Would it be wise to protect these pages ? __label__1 Oh, that ' s because I only copyedited a tiny section of the article. Should I still count that as a yes ? __label__1 I have done a gridView with images that show a spinner and download image.. When download is complete, the image shows? Interested ? __label__1 Why 5 things? Why not 3 or 7 ? __label__1 It was nominated for speedy deletion because he wasn ' t notable. However, if I undelete the page, will you improve the article and be able to provide decent sources to help his notability ? __label__1 Hi, it looks like the en / em distinction is being preserved. What do you see as the advantage of changing the way they ' re currently written ? __label__1 Can you provide more context for your second code example? Specifically, how is $doc defined ? __label__1 How are your PC and PS3 connected to the network (i . e. wirelessly or via ethernet)?__label__1 The code you ' ve posted works fine for me. Are you doing something like `get _ simps ( get _ simps ( 20))`?__label__1 Hi there. On a tangential note, would you happen to be <person>?__label__1 Which VB do you want an answer for? VB . Net, VB6, VBA, or VBScript ? __label__1 The section starting with ''a philosophical defeat, etc'' is somewhat informal in style. Could you try to eliminate solecisms when you get a chance ? __label__1 Suppose you have a 2 x 2 grid, and your array contains [0, 0] and [1, 1]. What would the correct table output be ? __label__1 I ' ve never seen a key between Shift and Z either. Could that be European thing ? __label__1 I once saw someone touch the (house ) radiator to discharge before working inside a PC. Does that really help ? __label__1 The classes are still not indented properly. Can you post the fixed code so people would see what trouble you ' re having ? __label__1 Back when the Nirvana article was a COTW (in like September I think) I started working out a "Musical style" section on a userpage, but never finished it. Would you like to help out with it ? __label__1 What does "repair the sequence by replacing the repeated numbers" mean? Can you provide an example of the finished product (showing intermediate steps)?__label__1 I know, I understood that. :) I didn ' t scold you for it at all, did I make you feel that way ? __label__1 Ok, thanks for that. Could you please tell me why the Kiwa page is giving warning about notability and citations, where as for example this one <url> is not ? __label__1 Sorry I figured the random characters in the receiving end of the socket gave it away. Why is the system receiving 94 / 64 / and 7 ' s (ascii decimal converted from ascii characters) and how can i fix it ? __label__1 I don ' t understand. That call stack is all about the Debug Help Library; is this only happening when it is being debugged ? __label__1 Hello Alex!

As cheap as possible regardless of the amount of work involved ? __label__1 Is it popular open source web application? Can we know the name of open source ? __label__1 I am reluctant to mention this, but having your paragraph in bold on <url> seems to me to be a bit self - promotional and unfair to the other members. Is there any chance that I might be able to persuade you to voluntarily unbold it ? __label__1 Is this occurring in the same dev environment where the default page is displaying the image as desired? Have you checked the DOM to see if there is some css class ( es) or javascript applying styles that hide it on the login page ? __label__1 Confused. Could you give a short example with an uncompressed input and the compressed output your algorithm produces ? __label__1 I ' m not sure what your problem is here.

What do you see ? __label__1 Your question currently doesn ' t make any sense as it is worded. Could you please edit it and clarify what you are asking ? __label__1 Hey, I think that perhaps Raleigh Park should redirct to <url> rather the the Nottingham halls of residece article.

Could you answer the questions and comment on the answers to refine the approach ? __label__1 Hi. How do you think, is <url> of FL quality ? __label__1 Are you studying computer science?

To get a cutoff of attribute number ? __label__1 Hi, Thank you for closing <url> as "delete", but much of the material immediately re - appeared at <url> (see <url>) so the questionable content hasn ' t been deleted at all. Can we do something about this ? __label__1 The cover art image shows annual #2 (1983), and says "introducing superwoman". Is that what you were looking for ? __label__1 If an object is cv::Mat, I can perform any linear algebraic, image processing, .. operations.

It looks like all of the basic options I was considering are basically OK from the perspective of the DAB project, right ? __label__1 Yeah, I saw the French logo on the top of the page.. I couldn ' t find any better versions of that logo, but the English one should suffice, right ? __label__1 pdfTeX does not alter images. Perhaps post the problematic file somewhere we can get at ? __label__1 @ yoda ..Done ! i edited it :) hey are you personally good at image processing in matlab ?__label__1 Maybe mine is a stupid question, but.. Are you running the program normally? or using the debug button ? __label__1 Also perhaps we should set up a subpage for these discussions, so we ' ll have the thread completely on one page? What do you think ? __label__1 Done. Do you specifically want small numbers inside the big number, or just shading ? __label__1 Soman, since you visited the Swedish Social Democratic Party site in May 2010, did you put the May 2010 "(This article) may need to be rewritten entirely to comply with Wikipedia ' s quality standards" atomic bomb tag at the top of the article? If so, will you clarify which sections you feel are inappropriate to a discussion of the political party, and what sort of focus you ' d prefer to see, and why ? __label__1 This seems hard and fragile. Why not just directly address any CSRF vulnerabilities that your site has ? __label__1 also, did you read through the documentation of add _ meta _ box at http://codex . wordpress . org / Function _ Reference / add _ meta _ box ?__label__1 And which part of that are you have trouble with, exactly?

The string that I send is build with (string + string).c _ str(), but shouldn ' t the c _ str() method alredy add the NULL - terminator ? __label__1 Thanks, can we write an article on that ? do you think it is notable enough ?__label__1 Please see my comments on <url> about a remark you added to <url> about the etymology of the term "minim" in music. Got any sources for your suggestion ? __label__1 Consider these numbers to be the production count of a company over a period of 8 years ( 200 to 2008 ) , i . e, Production Count ( 200) = 1, Production Count ( 2001) = 2 ..

As I am new in python its fun working with it but running against time.. Does any one want me to add anything more in the script??__label__1 Apologies if I am mistaken, but this reads like a homework question. Is it ? __label__1 There are already plenty of reasonably commonplace words presented in answers, but (slipping into 'armchair philologist' mode) I can ' t help wondering if the process of 'word - sharing' between languages is skewed more towards *importing* rather than *exporting* in the case of Far Eastern languages. Might the supposedly more self - effacing character of such speakers make them quicker to adopt the foriegner ' s words rather than keep pushing their own ? __label__1 For a single one - off script, for a web project (e . g. Rails, Sinatra, or other) or are you creating utility code that you want available for many scripts ? __label__1 Please post the important parts of what you have now, and what you ' re having trouble with.

Do you mean that your site doesn ' t come up in the results when you put those keywords in ? __label__1 An excellent news, indeed! I don ' t have time to have a look at it right now (busy with the fr FA), but do they have something on Gndevank ? __label__1 @Shinto Sherlock: You just *answered the question*. Why would you not post it as an answer ? __label__1 Please specify the platform you are compiling on, and also specify the command line options to the compiler that you ' re using.

S. (the D . C. area). Is this template going to be put into wider circulation once it is fixed and working ? __label__1 i know this doesn ' t help your problem but it ' s another corner case: what if two different cells want to swap with the same one? will one swap and then the other swap with the one it didn ' t intend to ? __label__1 What ' s the origin of the data graphed in <url>? The image is used in <url>, which has an in - text cite for solubility characteristics, but could you clarify the source for the graph itself ? __label__1 Im also looking for an answear to this one.

Have to ask, Davey: why is the Circus Maximus article on your page called <url>?__label__1 <url> reminded me of a report I want to file about Asad. May I ? __label__1 You may need to enable your own setting to allow E - mail too; I ' m not sure. If so, maybe you can turn it on temporarily, so that you can send me one e - mail ? __label__1 How does an object type change dynamically? Do you have a vehicle base blass and two derived classes: car and bike ? __label__1 `+1` from me just for posting a SO problem on SO. `:)` (Not that I could help with the problem, but seeing this I was asking myself what happens to the GC when a dispose function throws?)__label__1 I ' ll take a look at getLogEntries when I have time. Would you mind adding me as a committer ? __label__1 Shouldn ' t it be then reasonable to expect you to ask how are you DOING? / I ' m doing good, instead of how are you ? __label__1 What does 'N . B.' stand for ? __label__1 javascript problem I suspect. very strange, maybe some conflict with libraries or plugins in safari only ? __label__1 Just musing on creating an article about the formation of the Pixies (I reckon I could write a decent - sized article on the whole thing). What are your thoughts ? __label__1 maybe.. this belongs on cstheory . stackexchange . com? not sure ? __label__1 You mentioned an hour long video that included about 25 minutes of Will Wright just talking. Do you know where I could get a copy of this ? __label__1 Hi there, you entered info in the bio of <url>, saying he is related to <url>. Do you have any more info on the specific relationship, and also how they were related to <url> ?__label__1 Since no third - party app knows about any other, what possible touch - up of "reverse" are you doing? Is this something that ' s better done with a TemplateContext ? __label__1 I see that you don ' t have an account linked to the Wikipedia email. Would you be able to send me a message so that we can talk off Wikipedia ? __label__1 I ' m curious: how do you make those beautiful coats of arms? Do you have a script that generates them from the heraldic descriptions, or do you make them by hand ? __label__1 You may want to post the code right here. Maybe use pastebin or something if it ' s too much to embed directly in your post ? __label__1 I ' ve replied to most of the concerns. Could you please look over them ? __label__1 Thanks, was getting worried there for a moment. Have you though of asking Outriggr for a hand with <url>?__label__1 This question isn ' t really on topic, in my view. It also might induce a holy war, along the lines of "vi or emacs?"__label__1 What happens when you run this under debugging, and what ' s your configuration? Can you show me the first part of the packages file it creates ? __label__1 Hmm.. it works!! Any reasonable explanation to why??__label__1 I was confused by "darkhad" being translated as "sacred ones", when the usual translation I know is smith or craftsman (kind of). Was I at least correct in being confused ? __label__1 I believe you wanted to find out which party the PP was? Well i ' m sure you ' ll be able to find it at http://elections . uwa . edu . au / partysearch . lasso - my guess is that it could be the Progress Party, who ran in the 1977 WA HoR election ? __label__1 If the deleted image only has a single character then no need to restore. Would you be against adding an image illustrating the 4 protagonist dinosaurs ? __label__1 The result you ' re getting is odd. Can you please post more information ? __label__1 pls see my comments on your revert on the talk page. Perhaps you ' ll consider undoing my revert ? __label__1 So is there any problem / issue you are facing? What is the problem ? __label__1 You are passing a URL string into a method that takes a file path. Did you try initWithContentsOfURL and passing an NSURL instead ? __label__1 What defines the end of an entry? Is it guaranteed that the lines within an entry won ' t start with a digit, but a line defining a new entry will ? __label__1 Are you looking for a total ordering? or just an ordering ? __label__1 Does each '?' have to be substituted with the same letter, or can they be different ? __label__1 You should also consider the ergonomics of your setup. For instance, does one configuration or the other cause you to move your next out of it ' s natural position more than the other ? __label__1 I see a "remove protection" tab on the <url>, which tells an admin that the article is protected. Are you still able to edit it ? __label__1 What do you call a keyword? Every [long enough] word in a string ? __label__1 I was trying to create a subpage. Could you please make it a subpage for me ? __label__1 I tried to create a similar map for Canada but couldn ' t get a usable output from the site you used for the Australia map. Could you create a Canadian one ? __label__1 What version of bash are you using? Is it 4 . x or 3 . x ? __label__1 thanks - that ' s what I feared, but it ' s good to hear that you found it workable. If this site is available, can you please let me know the URL ? __label__1 Not exactly - I did some messing around and implemented a solution using NSMatrix, as per Apple ' s (very old) Core Recipes code sample. Edit: I note that your comment is rather old - did you resolve the issue ? __label__1 Ok, you are right! But what is the reason for ostream& tab ( ostream & output) to take a param as ostream& but not void ? __label__1 A very good explanation. Thanks. Which 'degrees' are those? Fahrenheit or Celcius ? __label__1 Thanks for your reply. So just to clarify then, you are happy with the number of references, but you just need me to convert each of them into ref / footnote format, and then the article is GA - ready, is that correct ? __label__1 How do you sync the flash? Do you mean that you just press the shutter button and then try to manually activate the flash in time to light the picture ? __label__1 seems fine in Chrome. How exactly does one reproduce the problem ? __label__1 I am looking at a more brute force and exhaustive approach, I am curious as to your performance / memory concerns. Is this something being done a lot or just once for different sets of letter combinations ? __label__1 I vaguely remember using Sugiyama ' s with more than one input / output, but I could be wrong. Can you write down a pointer to the alg logic you are using to refresh my memory ? __label__1 Please clarify something for me. Are you getting leaks from the top of the valve itself or from the base, where the stem meets the rubber tube ? __label__1 Can you please be more specific?? What do u mean by "but it ' s not a problem as far as the tutorial goes" ??__label__1 I ' m curious what your reasoning is in saying <url>'s edits are in "good faith" and not blocking him when the two edits right before that were both vandalism of user pages. It seemed quite a slam dunk to me, did you happen to see something I missed ? __label__1 looks like it ' s a conflict with the Prototype library, which we introduced in the newer version. Any ideas how to stringify a json object containing an array under Prototype ? __label__1 Hi Darwi. Just to ask you as curiosity, how did that debate ended ? __label__1 I was in doubt too, but when dealing with such incomprehensible concoctions I prefer to err on the side of BLP caution. Would you like it userfied ? __label__1 Moved. would you like me to nominate you for adminship ? __label__1 you already release FootballScoreBoardViewController. Can you show your code ?__label__1 And an "intelligent crop" is a 3rd. Note though that the aspect ratios are different in the example (0 . 96 vs 1 . 1) so perhaps Andre means resizing first, then cropping to match aspect ratio ? __label__1 I ' m hesitant to deal the final blow to this question to be honest. If dealing with CSS isn ' t a part of webmastering, then what is ? __label__1 I confess, no. What ' s exactly to be read in the docs you are referring to ? __label__1 What do you mean by incrementally? Do you whant to add all permutations in a List or do you want a function that produce the next permutation from the given string ?__label__1 Do they all have the same size and orientation ? Can you pivote them or should they conserve both proportion and orientation ?__label__1 thanks for working on that. but.. what is the difference between what you added to the intro, and what was already written below ? __label__1 I ' d be curious to know how your activity timestamps could come in out - of - order for a given user session. Would it realistically report 13 : 00, 14 : 00, 13 : 30 for a given user ? __label__1 The <url> page said that <url> will be shown on the <url> subchannels 26 . 5 and 26 . 6, and also on analog channel 48. It is also expected that The U Too will displace Me Too from analog channel 48. If that ' s the case, then, where do you suppose Me Too will end up? What new channel in Chicago will it be shown on ? __label__1 It ' s unclear to me what you mean with "rule engine" in your question. Could you elaborate ? __label__1 Yeah- using a stack for depth first. Did you know that you use a queue for breadth first ? __label__1 i ' ve checked the values at the return statement..they ' re valid..but once it actually returns i get nothing. is this something to do with scope ? __label__1 I ' m having the exact same problem. Did you ever find a solution ? __label__1 Hmm It ' s a "promo" block that displays a picture with text underneath it on the left sidebar, on every page. So through your questions, Grezly, I ' m perceiving that I must somehow make the home page show up as a block with a "teaser" underneath on every page ? __label__1 Great question, I ' m really curious about that also. Any mechanical engineer types out there got a good explanation ? __label__1 Problem solved! Aren ' t administrators handy ? __label__1 In that case it might not be the answer then (hence the comment). Are you using the VS web server or IIS Express ? __label__1 You left some comments at <url>, specifically about referencing. I ' ve added some references to the sections you outlined and was wondering if it addressed your concerns enough for you to give the article your support ? __label__1 Which logs? The logs in the question are my Nginx ones which Passenger is set to write to, are there any others around I should check? :)__label__1 No, I don ' t know of any way to measure the number of visitors to articles. Perhaps someone on the <url> can answer your question ? __label__1 I uploaded a new version of the Desert Storm map, with Egyptian, Syrian and multinational forces labeled (<url>). How does it look now ? __label__1 OS? OpenGL implementation vendor? Can you post a complete, minimal program that demonstrates the problem ? __label__1 I ' d think just changing `count(*)` to `count ( issues.*)` would be what you ' re looking for, right ? __label__1 Here ' s my question, just to be clear, is it possible for the owner to release the picture under a lower resolution for Wikipedia and at the same time retaining the ownership of the higher resolution version? If it is, can you help me process this image ? __label__1 Please, add the first part to your post. You mean both players should have the same number of parts of the stick ? __label__1 I know that "click here" should be avoided, at least for semantics. Can somebody please explain "It ruins a perfectly good SEO opportunity"?__label__1 I have put another warning on <url> with full details of the vandalism. Can this be reported to London Grid, please ? __label__1 You ' re welcome. What else is peer review for ? __label__1 I ' m sorry, but I don ' t see what you ' re talking about. Could you be more specific ? __label__1 Would you be willing to do another pre - FAC review of a different article for me? Specifically, the "John J. Tigert" article ? __label__1 This is not a suitable candidate for CSD as it asserts notability. May I suggest you consider a <url>?__label__1 When I wrote <url> I was not quite sure if it was a synonym of <url>, and hence did not perform a merge. Could you clarify if they are indeed the same, and if so whether we should merge the articles ? __label__1 I am currently writing up an RfA for Chacor. Can you check with the other Arbcom members and make absolutely sure that he ' s authorized to run ? __label__1 can you be a little more specific and perhaps give some examples of the current vs. desired interface ? __label__1 I don ' t know if I understand correctly: Do you want to add a new image tag to your div tag? Where do you have your list ? __label__1 How was the bell frogging? Where about did you go and what did you see ? __label__1 i get this as well, is it only happening since you moved to a later version of xCode? is your configuration in Debug ? __label__1 Do you disagree with this reasoning?. If so, could you explain why ? __label__1 Sorry, wrong guess then. :-) I presume your system is fully up - to - date and you ' ve restarted your machine after the last update ? __label__1 Can you give a little more context? What library contains this line of code ? __label__1 Do you want to check if it looks ok ? Do you want to check if the file exists ?__label__1 Your question is phrased badly as it is both a double - negative and infers that we can read your mind. What you meant to say, I think, is, "Can you help me understand the meaning of this quote?"__label__1 Thanks for the heads up. What damage did they do ? __label__1 Please explain why you think the `ClassNotFoundException` is incorrect. Possibly even share some code ? __label__1 I thought our short conversation last evening showed that cooperation might be possible. Was I wrong ? __label__1 I like the close votes with no explanation. How is this not a real question ? __label__1 What have you tried? What didn ' t work ? __label__1 This already works in the summary column in the debugger window or inline data tip when you hover over the variable in your editor. Am I misunderstanding your question ? __label__1 I want to implement the whole online banking stack, from front - end, middleware, and back - end. So is there any opensource J2EE app for online banking ? __label__1 Can you post your .htaccess? And which directory is it in ? __label__1 @Ivo Wetzel So, you are saying there is not way to get all objects attributes and values ? Or to convert such object to an associative array ?__label__1 I noticed that you have a little note at the top saying your status. How do you do that ? __label__1 The link you gave isn ' t a repository, but a page with links to the repositories for various fedora versions. Did you try those links, or did you somehow try to use the link you gave as though it was the repository ? __label__1 Does it need to follow a specific pattern? Or is it fine if the characters from the input set appear potentially at any place ? __label__1 Do you have any thoughts on renaming the page to reflect that the notability (and most of the content) is about the labor dispute / takeover, etc. than the company itself ? __label__1 If you view the image by itself in a new tab / window. What dimension does the image turn out to be ? __label__1 This question is vague. Can you give a more detailed explanation as to the problem and provide some code ? __label__1 I ' m highly in favor of "exposing Wikipedia ' s users" to these excellent pictures; that should go for ''all'' of Wikipedia ' s users, not just the ones who use this English edition. What do you think: could we add a note to <url> encouraging people to put their FPCs on the Commons ? __label__1 I ' ve never heard of this happening. Is this one of the core widgets ? __label__1 @D . W. if thats the case, as I thought, it ' s not really a security question, is it ? __label__1 Just one more thing: The <url>' logo was re - made as a vector image a little while ago, but the colors (especially the skin), really seem to be off. Can you fix it ? __label__1 @Shane I ' m using Rscript. How are you loading your scripts ? __label__1 Just to clarify: Do you want your program to be notified of mouse click events so that it can act upon them, or do you want to inject mouse click events into the windowing system? And what platform are you on (mac/*nix / Windows / etc)?__label__1 I was just curious why you named the <url> for Williamsburg County, not Georgetown County. Is it because W County is listed first by the GNIS ? __label__1 There is something that is not clear to me. Do you want to stop the assembly execution for debugging purposes and inspect the code at an arbitrary location ? __label__1 On your Citation templates subpage you have the statement "CS1 and CS2 both use <person> as a meta - template and are variants of APA style." In the past I have had experienced editors tell me this, but none of them could point to any documentation or contemporaneous discussion to verify this statement. Can you point me to any confirmation of this statement ? __label__1 LordAmeth-- once again, many thanks for nominating me. I have a question, though-- I noticed that the process was "scheduled to end" at 16 : 52 today, and we ' re past that now..what happens next ? __label__1 Do you live in the US? How excited are people about the album ? __label__1 Not really following what you need, are you looking for something like: http://drupal . org / project / hierarchical _ select ? __label__1 From my reading of the entries, the Japanese force in <url>/South <url> & the <url> appears to have been the <url>, rather than the <url>. Does that sound right ? __label__1 You are right, I apologize not doing so. A different layout for the template could be interesting (perhaps even with names, or those delivered in person / by text) but I didn ' t quite see the logic in the way you had broken up the dates by 20 year blocks interspaced with 4 year blocks, right ? __label__1 Is it possible that it could be a passenger issue? Does devise / warden cache the current _ user variable ? __label__1 Yes, I do. Am I referencing a keyword by mistake ? __label__1 Hey, i saw you added <person> some time ago to the pic page. I ' m just curious, why do you want it to still be available here ? __label__1 For all downvoters, it may be that english it ' s not his native language. @varsha: You want to create such an application or you already have one and want to configure it ? __label__1 Hi, Leandrod - my computer is slow, and your last two edits were made on top of vandalism that needed to be reverted - I can ' t tell if I reverted legit changes by you or not? If I did, I ' m sorry, can you have a look ? __label__1 Also, I think it might not happen with all applications. Can you please use Banshee as the app we ' re testing with ? __label__1 I bet this is not what you ' re looking for. But according to my experience the error should be really small.. Have you tried replacing the 2 with a 2 . 0 ? __label__1 Can you explain your question a bit more, since if each node keeps track of nodes it is connected to, it looks like you have a graph that has connected components, and for each node type, find the number of connected components that node type is found in, the one present in most connected components is the type that has the longest unconnected chain. is that what you meant ? __label__1 @svante - I ' m fine with that! Care to give any feedback on what I SHOULD be using ? __label__1 I responded to your talk page comment, encouraging you to try your hand at reworking it. Good analysis of a potential problem, so why not take a whack at it ? __label__1 What would stop the algorithm from just producing a regular expression that is the "or" of all the possible substrings? Or would you be comfortable with this regular expression from being produced ? __label__1 What library are you using for XPath? Are you setting the namespace mappings in there ? __label__1 Well, when you call `new Class();`, it returns a pointer to the location of that instance of the class. Is that what you are referring to ? __label__1 Then you obviously have problem with your fwrite call. Could you provide the code you use ? __label__1 @Bob Murphy: Yeap, you see, *I ' m sorry* is used waay too often, and usually it doesn ' t mean that someone is sorry - it ' s just a protocol keyphrase. Do we need protocol keyphrases where real action and attitude is what ' s actualy needed ? __label__1 This sounds familiar. Was this discussed on SO within the past two months or was it on programmers . SE ? __label__1 What environment are you running the code on? Could you enclose the code as it would make it easier to help you for us SO ' ers ? __label__1 @wooble: I might need some help here, what ' s your calculation ? I get something like 56 . 8 billion combinations ?__label__1 Is it a directed, acyclic graph? or are cycles allowed ? __label__1  " Deceleration" is negative acceleration. Have you taken calculus ? __label__1 I notice that spell checkers complain if you don ' t capitalize Internet. Didn ' t yours ? __label__1  " Too localized?" How does that apply to this question ? __label__1 I have made a Ukrainian version. Were would you like me to email it to ? __label__1 I ' m afraid <url> is slightly under the 5x expansion threshold. Could you please see my comments at <url>?__label__1 Thanks Anon. Better now ? __label__1 I just logged in for the first time this weekend. Do you want me to run through or have you already started ? __label__1 I ' m going to remove it. Is that okay with you ? __label__1 Can you give examples for _positive_ and _negative_ articles, please? Isn ' t that subjective ? __label__1 Do you always start from 0 , 0 (or the bottom - left - most point)? Or can you start from any point ? __label__1 I can ' t reproduce this. You have selected `Taxonomy: Term` and not `Taxonomy: Term ID` in the Sort Criteria box ? __label__1 What are the project settings for the version you are debugging? For example, is the Debugging element defined so that there is a corresponding pdb file ? __label__1 I ' ve started looking at this article as you asked and inevitably I ' ve got a few questions. Would you prefer me to list them here or on the article ' s talk page ? __label__1 I noticed your nice improvements to <url>. Are you thinking of merging / redirecting <url> to that article ? __label__1 I like the image of the Finnish lighthouses. Do you know if it is for sale anywhere as a poster ? __label__1 I have moved the page back, as well as created the new article <url>. Is that better ? __label__1 Nice, what did you set it to? greater or smaller ? __label__1 In terms of suitability for an article, as I understand it, Merrill ' s "claim to notice" is due to the company (work done by SOM, size of SOM, etc), and also because of the important changes he made to that company. Is that roughly correct ? __label__1 Have you tried to fully uninstall your application from your development phone and reinstall it from scratch? Maybe your database creation method is wrong ? __label__1 Would you mind doing the same for <url>?__label__1 Sorry if this is a stupid question.

You can have a map of maps like `std::map<Key1, std::map<Key2, Val>>`, can you use that to describe your situation ? __label__1 I saw you work alot with medal of honor articles and I wanted to ask. If you think that <url> article is close to GA ? __label__1 The article that you reference does a good job explaining this: "the SortedDictionary ( TKey, TValue) generic class is a binary search tree with O ( log n) retrieval, where n is the number of elements in the dictionary.". Did you have a more specific question or answer that you were looking for ? __label__1 @Unreason About the rectangular case - think of the situation when points aren ' t positioned in a rectilinear way (basically, the points inside the rectangle can take any position and, hence, build complex curves). If I have some matrix with these points, what should I do to make my mesh resolution larger (in terms of points per square inch, for example)?__label__1 I would specifically appreciate an outside view at the thread <url>. What do you feel is the appropriate action ? __label__1 What are you optimizing for? For example, read throughput (concurrent reads from multiple machines), fault tolerance in the face of machines becoming not available, low number of machines.. Do you also need writes ? __label__1 A little bit more detail would be ideal to get the question. At least, how does your data look like, who are the subscribers, what do they have to do with average time, and how is 'average time in service' defined ? __label__1 I ' m afraid I don ' t know what you mean Arcayne. What comment ? __label__1 Can you please describe in more detail what you mean with "inclined"?

Or you want to set the current directory within the C program ? __label__1 Just now I created this stub.

Or Both ? __label__1 Usefulness and acceptable range of RMSE depends on the goal of the enhancement you are doing and the contents of the image.

Maybe next time ? __label__1 @user12739 Give us more information please. What problem are you having exactly ? __label__1 i have used zxing library before but never tackled the code in it. Is this the most appropriate way ?__label__1 Hmm, still don ' t quite see what you ' re aiming for. Could you perhaps explain where you *think* things can be generalised / abstracted (at least verbally / in pseudocode)?__label__1 Opps, how come your archive links to the article ' s talk page archive? I ' m going to fix it for you, ok ? __label__1 Can we pass a law that cars may not be operated within 100 yards of children under the age of 6? Which law would have a greater impact on public health ? __label__1 I ' d think the issue is that the tabs are starting from different column numbers because of longer and shorter filenames. Could you change it to `puts [OK]\t \ tx` so that the OKs line up and the filenames start at the same column ? __label__1 If an edge connecting the graph to a leaf node is to be deleted, is it assumed to delete the leaf node as well? Alternatively, does deleting a leaf node also delete the edge connecting it to the rest of the graph ? __label__1 Could you please give me a reference, that 95% should lie between -1 . 96 ; 1 . 96 .

Can you please also accept it so that the system knows that the problem is solved ? __label__1 A proposal has been made for the above WikiProject at <url>. Would you be interested in contributing to it ? __label__1 I added a clarifying sentence to my user page <url>. Do you think it distills the essence ? __label__1 There is no line that begins with "X - From_:" in the "show original" message. Any other suggestions ? __label__1 Hi Kathleen - It looks OK to me; all I did was change the template wording a bit and add parent cats to the stub category. What problem were you having ? __label__1 Regarding comment on "length of Performance reviews" section - the intention here is to provide support for the statement in the biography that "Latsabidze is already regarded by many as one of the more significant performers of his generation". Do you recommend that I just delete this statement, or is there some other way to support it other than providing representative critical reviews that say so ? __label__1 It didnt work when I replaced Lbs2 by t. Lbs2 is the model that has been created to store lat, lng and body. Can you please suggest some other changes should be made ? __label__1 ElendilTheTall - Please read my comment to the question. Can you explain why the focus supposedly locks when the camera is in Auto mode (are things different with Nikon)?__label__1 @Mike: I would stick to what I have if this is better than what I am seeking. My thinking is if there was already an calculated number assigned, I can use it because $(".chk : even") and $(".chk : odd") would be iterating through all rows twice correct ? __label__1 I look forward to your genre plan. What do you have in mind ? __label__1 It could be the way you are saving your photo for web - use. Are you using Photoshop ' s "Save for Web" option ? __label__1 could you describe the problems you are having?

May I get in touch with you via e - mail to work on the specifics ? __label__1 Good point. What about in non - sushi applications? Should I always rinse rice? or, is it OK not to rinse when I ' m not making sushi ? __label__1 You ' re welcome. Do you have an opinion as to whether they would be worth adding to <url>?__label__1 Hi, I am having problems with one of the references you added as it goes to the main page and not to one showing any of the figures on religion. Can you have a look at <url>?__label__1 Hi I noticed that you changed the category at <url> from "People from Alabama" to "People from Elmore County, Alabama". Is this appropriate, as Opothleyahola was dead for three years before Elmore county had been organized and had been forcibly removed from the area more than thirty years before ? __label__1 I am not familiar with the credit card / porn star identity incident you mentioned in AnonEMouse ' s RFA, but I would like to take a closer look at it. Could you provide some more direct diffs related to Mouse ' s involvment ? __label__1 I am really disappointed that common speech allows the use of `who` like that, and I think I am correct when I say that if the cashier had said "Can I help whomever is next?" you will hear snickering in line and a subtle "Why is she speaking like that?".__label__1 What would the recommended sequencing be, then?.. GAR, then FAR ? __label__1 Yes, I ' m delighted; result after a torturous few days! Um, can we add a Dali or Miro img ? __label__1 One other question I have is that the ''Wikipedia'' article states that his 1968 paper had been first rejected by American publications before it was accepted by the British one. Would you happen to know why ? __label__1 http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / User : Mheart did the copyedit for the Japanese flag article and it was completed today. Is there anything else other than a copyedit that you need for this article ? __label__1 I ' m unfamiliar with the principles behind mixing paint. Can you briefly explain how this works so people like me may better answer the spirit of your question ? __label__1 Hello, I ' ve written a page about the <url>, shamelessly copying the style from your CCT / FoFC lists. In the process, have I missed anything out ? __label__1 Hi, I missed your valued contributions recently. Everything ok ? __label__1 Hi Eugene, long ago you made a dump of missing articles at <url>. Are you able to produce a new dump like this, as it needs a refresh, otherwise can you point me to how it is done ? __label__1  * Find a random element* sounds like picking a random element. But I assume you want to find a *specific* element in the array, right ? __label__1 It ' s not clear what you mean by 'Printing ( saving)'. Where do you want the command saved to ? __label__1 This doesn ' t really make any sense. Are the word documents going to be downloaded from links on the site or do they just contain text FOR the site ? __label__1 Very weird indeed. Are there two newlines after each pubDate ? __label__1 how far off of their true locations are the points? meters, or not even in the right general area ? __label__1 Agreed with @Kyle. Did you try increasing the width of the container housing the #featurebox - secondary just to verify if the widths are not out of place ? __label__1 Take a look at the standardisation i ' ve implemented for federal elections 1972 - 2004 inclusive on <url>.. i ' m happy with where it ' s at for now, but that bloody 1990 page sticks out like a sore thumb! How do you reckon I would go about forming a second concensus ? __label__1 Since you are the main contributor to <url>, I figured I should let you know what I would like to do to it. Would you be opposed to <url>, at all ? __label__1 Thanks for taking all that on..just wondering on the template if that Vancouver / North LM split vs Fraser Valley South LM split is something Elections BC cooked up; "North" and "South" just don ' t seem right geographically / compass - wise, it ' s more like "West" and East"..I ' m imagine there ' s reason to your rhyme; dito Vancouver Island / South Coast which is a - geographical somewhat if North Island is included (the Queen Charlotte Strait region is part of the Central Coast). If those are divisions used by Elections BC I guess that ' s what it is, though..I can make some additions to various pages describing the changes relating to ridings they ' re made out of and waht areas are in / out in each case..and since the districts were created in 2008, shouldn ' t hte title say that instead of 2009 ? __label__1 Take a look **[here](http://diy . stackexchange . com / questions / 7908 / what - resources - can - teach - me - to - draw - floor - plans - by - hand / 7911 # 7911)**. Is that the kind of thing you ' re after ? __label__1 There ' s been a slow revert war occurring between <url> and <url> over the Katja Kassin article and I ' ve just left a strongly worded suggestion that they hash out their differences in the article ' s talk page. Could you keep an eye on the article for a day or two, just to make sure they stop reverting and start discussing ? __label__1 A few more details are required. What ' s your latitude, longitude, date and timezone..?__label__1 Sounds like a framework bug. Could you upload a minimal .xcproj so I can see what ' s going on ? __label__1 Correct, the ranges are intended to be discontinuous. I think if ranges were continuous, then it would really be just one range, without any breaks / gaps, correct ? __label__1 Perhaps you can help me. How do I view the status of a vandalism report I ' ve made ? __label__1 Version 2 . 6 . 6. Is this addressed in a newer version ? __label__1 What about installing "TTS Service Extended"? Does that do anything for you ? __label__1 And NFS and DNS and other stuff too. Can you provide a breakdown by port ? __label__1 @hammar: Yes we can, assume it ' s a x86 architecture. Could you give a bit more detail on this approach ? __label__1 I have the same problem. How did you resolved it ? __label__1 ''Wiki - star'': Hm? Is there a reason for your sorrow my good man ? __label__1 Yep, she told me. How are you doing ? __label__1 @user705414: What platform are you using? Linux / Unix / Windows ? __label__1 Some time ago you uploaded an image of the Knowledge Navigator, which was speedied some time later. Can you upload the file again ? __label__1 @Max: Good point, although you misspelled my name. How do you know that 1UU0 is the only one that ' s impossible ? __label__1 css text - indent can be used to move text off the screen. Will that work ? __label__1 Oh I see; I misread it, sorry. So you want to know number the number of equivalence classes (via their language) of DFA of size n ? __label__1 Hi JoJan. I see that the template which listed the failed FA attempt on <url> was deleted from the talk page, and I wanted to ask if that is considered OK or not ? __label__1 can you clarify - do you have a time with timezone as input, and want time and different timezone as output? Or is the input time GMT ? __label__1 I ' m not that familiar with Bezier curves; does this give you what you need to construct them? Can you elaborate how to finish it off ? __label__1 Hi ER, which Bio. do you think could use a little of my majic (smile)?__label__1 Sounds interesting. Could people keep me in the loop as well ? __label__1 In the article <url>, the names and details of all the recipients (both the chronological list and the alphabetical list) have now been completed. What steps should now be taken in order to reassess the article ' s rating on the Wikipedia Israel Project quality scale, and also to ensure that that the article is correctly referenced within the project ? __label__1 Interesting question. Are you after a theoretical discussion or is there a specific problem you ' re trying to solve ? __label__1 @jrista. can you please describe your setup ? __label__1 It seems if I change @property (nonatomic, copy) NSMutableArray *blockViews, to retain, the error goes away. but why ? __label__1 Isn ' t this too time localized anyway? How long will "at the moment" last ? __label__1 Heh, thanks. Do you know of any scripts that might come in handy ? __label__1 what happens when you type, for example, `git` on the command line? Or `which git`?__label__1 With respect to your format, I think that all the things listed in the section before the sections should be separated as slang refs, phrases using breaking then the other section that appears. What do you think ? __label__1 I ' m trying to do the same thing. Did you ever get an answer ? __label__1 I wish I could say, but I don ' t know what it is. Could you tell me a little more ? __label__1 Thanks. Can you use <url>?__label__1 It has been a pleasure working with you on the Burma campaign. What is your source for the Japanese information you have been adding as the books I have been reading on the subject are all from a British or American perspective ? __label__1 Ok, many thanks for that. I ' m not sure how reliable that 2nd group are - it has <url> but what about all his dinner - guests ? __label__1 How exactly have you set its height? Have you implemented heightForRowAtIndexPath ? __label__1 This has been tagged Civ - 4, that seems to be the wrong game. Was a different tag intended ? __label__1 What have you tried? Have you read the documentation ? __label__1 Hi Dirk. Does the two books you cited for the heavy Belgian <url> losses have any info of how many Gladiators the Belgians lost, and perhaps what losses they incurred on the Germans ? __label__1 Hey can this thing emit human language? I mean like words ? __label__1 Try using 'localhost' as your address. Does it work ? __label__1 I do not know what you mean by "important links" as you mentioned on my talk page. Will you please clarify ? __label__1 Are you running the latest version of PhoneGap - i . e. clone from the github repository ? __label__1 Is it ok to use words like: here are some "good" or "recommended" reliable secondary sources? Or does that have to be determined by consensus ? __label__1 You ' re just discarding any useful exceptions that download() will throw - Image . open() might be trying to read "" being returned by download(), which would explain the current error you ' re receiving. If you remove that try..catch block, do you receive any more informative errors ? __label__1 Not sure, but maybe you want a clustering alorithm, e . g. http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / K - means _ clustering ? __label__1 @shane87: How did you generate the managed type of the `photo` variable you are calling through? What is the IDL of the COM method ? __label__1 I have started to fix it. Can you help ? __label__1 It may be redundant in source, but is it redundant in binary? Is it a good practice to always check code like this because although all statements depend on the ones before them (in program flow), the program flow may change from any number of sources ? __label__1 Great question; too bad none of the answers have any clues to the origin though. There must be countless words which can approximate one second, so why the name of a southern US state ? __label__1 Looks like a type in the second `RewriteCond`. Should you have a space before the `\.html`?__label__1 Is the set of tasks known in advance, or are more tasks being added as you go? Do you have have to worry about starvation (for example, a task with high c _ i never getting run if low c _ i tasks keep getting added)?__label__1 Now, I am looking at the source for `whine . pl` and it seems to be getting these from an SQL database. Isn ' t it better to use the appropriate `SELECT` query to get already sorted bugs out of the database ? __label__1 <url> is brand new and may need some attention. I thought you might be just the person who can help get that article at least secured against SPOD - attacks ? __label__1 hi Mustafaa I have some historical pictures and some sentences written on them which seems to be arabic. Can you tell me if it is arabic or not if i send you a copy ? __label__1 That sounds amazing!! Can I have the link? :D__label__1 why do you want to view the code? Maybe if you give a better description of what you want to do? :)__label__1 Could you precise your idea please ? Which expression of weights should I consider ?__label__1 OK, I ' ve started the deletion debate at <url>. As a major contributor, would you mind indicating there that you agree with deleting the page ? __label__1 In the ACR for <url>, you mentioned that you had concerns with my writing style and were wary of supporting it. Can you specifically clarify what content in the article you had grammatical concerns with so I can make the needed improvements and gain your support ? __label__1 Thanks! =D And how soon are we going to try to get The Lost Age to FA ? __label__1 Did you try writing something in an attempt to implement this? If so, what happens when you run it ? __label__1 Would you email me with any points / incidents you especially want me to be aware of? Do you think Jimbo will be willing to pass this to the arbitration committee ? __label__1 +1 for not saying "hey, I ' ll just rent a VPS! I won ' t get hacked because I ' ve got automatic updates, right?"__label__1 Hey Jondel. I was wondering, since Interlingua is basically resurrected Latin, k and w are basically nonexistant in Interlingua, right ? __label__1 Please discuss general principles on <url>. Do you think there should be a controversies page, or do you think the controversies should be integrated into the mainline texts of the various Giuliani articles ? __label__1 @cvondrick, in that case I ' d rather use binary insertion and sorting. My problem now, is however how I can combine two dates to one number ? __label__1 but the breakpoint doesn ' t affect anything unless the condition holds, so you can put your breakpoint anywhere (like the Setter) and take it from there. Or am I missing something ? __label__1 Regarding your time setting, I ' m a little unsure what you want to do - there are only two things you can change - the timezone offset from GMT, which you set at the bottom of the screen by selecting the correct offset for your location from the list - I ' m guessing Asia / Calcutta would be about right, and the way the date / time is displayed, which you choose from the list of five options at the top of the screen. What problems are you having ?__label__1 Well done on adding references, I ' ve expanded intro to cover whole article but what i ' ve added needs to be tightened a little. Looks close to GA, were you going to nominate soon or planning to take to FAC ? __label__1 So, to conclude, it should be acceptable for the beginning to have only one SceneGraph, that would contain all the objects in the scene. Can you advise please, if cameras, lights, triggers should be in the scene graph as well ? __label__1 @Mike: I don ' t know Java yet. Could you explain what makes this work in Java but not in C++?__label__1 Could you provide some more precise input and output values? Do you want to convert "[link ] ww . yahoo . com[/link]" to "<a href='ww . yahoo . com'>ww . yahoo . com</a>"?__label__1 Assuming for the moment that it ' s NOT a bug, it does make me think we could 'reverse engineer' the purposes of the different colors by shooting some test shots. What happens if you manually select a focus point, for example ? __label__1 no way! can you show us the entire loop ? __label__1 the screw supposed to fasten the lever. can you send a couple of pictures ? __label__1 Hi. Just out of interest, are you by any chance the same Tom Walker who maintains this <url>?__label__1 I guess you know how a template looks, for everything..something like from the small thumbnails to the big backgrounds as you said. I will give you some ideas..tech, management, industry, computers, food, can you picture what i`m trying to say ?__label__1 Greetings, I ran across your 2008 article <url>, and the footnotes are done manually vice the usual Wiki way. Any chance you can go back and fix the footnotes ? __label__1 Made a bunch of changes to the <url> article. What do you think ? __label__1 Sorry.. haven ' t unblocked many people before. Is it ok now ? __label__1 Which platform are you using? Which perl version ? __label__1 I think this deserves its own article, as opposed to being in the centrifugal one. Do you have any good sources that describe how it works ? __label__1 And in the future, I should just add to this topic, or should I create a new one at the bottom? Aslo, can I contact you by editing my talk page ? __label__1 Thanks, I will try this. How much can the temperature fluctuate? How close to 20C does it need to be ? __label__1 You appear to ask two different questions: are you building a language parser and wish to base your parser on a pile of regex? Or are you trying to implement a competitor to [pcre](http://ww . pcre . org/) or [Oniguruma](http://ww . geocities . jp / kosako3 / oniguruma / doc / RE . txt) regular expression parsers ? __label__1 ER, I was wondering if <url> would be a good candidate for featured bio in the portal, since he was the first United States Marine Corps officer, in history to take command of a Naval flotilla. What do you think ? __label__1 Merci. Now do you have any idea to solve discrepancy in <url> ?__label__1 Please, give some more information. What have you tried, and what error / behavior did it give ? __label__1 The <url> has a request (header "<url>") left a few hours ago by someone who has pictures of signs in China but can ' t read them. Would you please be willing to help ? __label__1 I ' ve had similar problems. Are you using any extension ? __label__1 Likewise there is some discussion at <url>, where <url> is categorising itself and its documenttation. Could you please fix that as well ? __label__1 Is the viewport fixed sized? And is the image fixed sized ? __label__1 Can you write the URL of this page? Also, does it have any kind of authentication on it ? __label__1 In my opinion, if the variable is significant (p<.001) without imputation, and you have enough data, that is reason enough to leave it alone. What are the confidence intervals telling you ? __label__1 Yes, it is a matter of civility. Do you think a year would be better ? __label__1 Hi Tim. As I ' ve seen you editing it recently, I won ' t delete it but.. do you think <url> deserves an article at present ? __label__1 Thanks, I tried to do that but don ' t know how to do it? Can you help ? __label__1 Interesting question. Even if you didn ' t end up with a powder as a result- how can you make a stock or consume so pure that it doesn ' t taste like meat anymore ? __label__1 I ' ve tried to understand your question, but it is hard. Can you improve the formatting so that we can see what you are asking ? __label__1 That would be awesome. Do you want to ask someone for clarification on whether project sandboxes are allowed ? __label__1 Clever work with the search and replace (I still think w : es should have recognised that ISO date format, tho'). Now, any idea where I can find a list of the DF ' s late, unlamented ''regentes'' to flesh out my <url> article ? __label__1 I might be able to help, but I don ' t really know the GA criteria though. What would you like me to do ? __label__1 @mike: Could you edit the title of this question to be more descriptive? Maybe something like "Current flow in batteries?"__label__1 Excellent question. Can we get som esources as to where the different styles originated ? __label__1 @kostya - LOL. I guess we don ' t want this site to turn into national - enquirer . se, right ? :)__label__1 I assume that when you rotate them, they have to remain axis - aligned? i . e. you can ' t rotate then by 30 degrees or anything like that ? __label__1 What happens if you export the layer to a gdb featureclass - does it have coordinates? Does the exported fc ' s spatialreference match that of zlevels ? __label__1 Wow what a brilliant and crazy question! Can I ask what you ' re going to do with it? Candlemaking ? __label__1 Great- so bump up to around ten selected pictures (selective choices, obviously) and then you feel it is ready for FPOC? Is there anything you feel the portal is obviously lacking ? __label__1 I began to make an article for <url> but found that one already existed but was deleted. After reading the deletion log and seeing that it was speedy deleted for a7, I think I can write an article that establishes notability, but am I required to get administration approval before recreating a deleted article or can I just create it on my own ? __label__1 Somebody labeled the "stenography" images you did for <url> as unverified. Would you midn adding a tag to those, too ? __label__1 Thanks for the explanation. Might not Aethelred have been following the example of his father, who also gave his sons the names of former kings ? __label__1 GorillaWarfare- I don ' t know if you saw my reply on my talk page.

Could the data from openstreetmap be complete enough for your locality ? __label__1 What version of SQL server are you using? Could you post your database . yml ? __label__1 I noted you just blocked 67 . 165 . 219 . 110 I stumbled across his "fun", but since I ' m new, I had no idea who to report him to. For future issues, is it at AN - V ? __label__1 Hi there, I ' ve reworded that paragraph a bit. Is it any clearer ? __label__1 I think I updated the pharmacology project banner to put C - class articles into the appropriate category (previously, it was putting them into the unassessed class. If you want to double - check, that would be great; I think it may take a little while for it to update the articles ? __label__1 Thats ok, as long as you verify the copyright as by sending an e - mail, or noting the license on the AEK webpage. That wont be a problem, will it ? __label__1 I use 11 . 04 and I still get the popup. Could you include a screenshot, please ? __label__1 Right from the first version you created, this article says she was born in both 1976 and 1985! Could you sort it out, please ? __label__1 I believe that would be different on different hardware. What architecture ? __label__1 Hello Arosboro, and welcome on _Drupal Answers_. May you report the code of `vtiger _ portal _ user _ form _ validate()`, which I think it is your custom form validation handler ? __label__1 Limericks? Do you mean "mnemonics"?__label__1 I could have a go. When would you need it ? __label__1 Try the same thing using SciPy? Save to text first and then use Asymptote or convert unix command ? __label__1 How would look your formula like after removing one, two, or all connectives? Could you give an example ? __label__1 Fair enough, thanks for assuming good faith, I was merely making the page consistant with the past 2 champions league season articles (<url>, <url>) which use path and non - champions instead of route and league. Should they be changed too or was that what they used to be called ? __label__1 The resulting table shouldn ' t have that primary key. What provider are you using ? __label__1 On reflection it ' s up for GA peer review, preparatory to trying for FAC. Would you care to <url>?__label__1 Hi.. I ' d actually like to move all images in <url> to the Commons. Is there a way that I can do it myself ? __label__1 Can you post your code?

Do you think <url> article is of a quality to maybe nominate it for GA yet ? __label__1 I updated original question with persistentStoreCoordinator method which I got from my AppDelegate . m. Regarding the two different managed objects, I guess I messed this up, am I only supposed to have one in the app delegate ? __label__1 you should post your xml layout here. What you have implemented so far ? __label__1 Incidentally, your username seems familiar. Do you contribute to SPGB - related forums by any chance ? __label__1 I edited my question. I know eval() evaluates a string as code but are my examples above correct ? __label__1 I tend not to be an RFC closer -- apologies. Hopefully someone else will ? __label__1 I started working on missing translations of news titles inside citations, but discovered that square brackets leave an ugly residue, while round ones may not be optimal, since they clash visually with the "language" ones.

And are resetLevel and resetTheGame methods clean ? __label__1 How would you differentiate a series of letters and an actual word?

I have some monkeys and ideas.." ?__label__1 If you ' re interested, I could provide you with Subversion (which is superior to CVS) for VandalProof. Interested ? __label__1 Are you sure you are getting the error on that line? What line are you trying to access the array on ? __label__1 Please clarify what you mean by 'sub - info'. Are you referring to the $info _ results array ? __label__1 The source on the Daniel Larsson page looks good enough. Perhaps someone at Swedish interwiki might know of other sources ? __label__1 Since Maddieson has not himself done any work on Mazahua I would be interested in knowing which source he uses for his Mazahua data. could you put a reference to his references here at the talk page, just for my curiosity ? __label__1 Ha, you ' re too kind to me, my old friend.

If you are satisfied with the changes, can you tell me if it is qualifiable for FAN and if not for FAN, then for A class status ? __label__1 Good point - I was unaware of that. Perhaps then you should include a short reference to Aquitanian in the sentence ? __label__1 I see this page is indefinitely semi - protected. It ' s been over eighteen months: mind if I give unprotecting it a try ? __label__1 Hello, again. Would you care to intervene at <url>?__label__1 I am afraid I do not quite understand the content of your message. Can you explain a little bit more ?__label__1 Can you please clarify your goals? Is pure - Perl what ' s important to you, or is zero - installation important ? __label__1 You need to add more code then. Can you post your main loop where you do the drawing ? __label__1  ' Best' is rather subjective. Do you mean easiest to use, fastest, or most elegant ? __label__1 My question about the truncation operation is to understand the generic algorithm for applying a ring (or un - ringing) a Dynkin node. What method (code) do you use to get the higher dimensions truncated based on the Coxeter Dynkin ringed nodes ? __label__1 If you have time could you look at <url><url> on the <url> article. I ' m wondering what your thoughts are in terms whether it should go or stay ? __label__1 I suppose you managed to connect your RMI registry and look up your remote object, right? Can you provide stacktrace (on client / server)?__label__1 I find it interesting claim that when using film, size gives any other advantage than resolution.

Can you tell us where you plan to post the results ? __label__1 I was just reminded of my offer to generate a list of uncategorised templates, when I happened across your bot request again. Are you still interested in such a thing ? __label__1 I was doing some minor editing on this, and noticed that the date of death in the intro and infobox don ' t match.

Is there another way to get the RGB value of individual pixels in android ? __label__1 It looks like each user has a single screen session. I ' m not familiar with byobu, why do you think there are five screen sessions ? __label__1 Hi, I hadn ' t realized that you had made a revert on redirecting this. Could you see my comments on <url>?__label__1 Alternatively, maybe the second column could be ''Country of origin'' and Rosen could simply be denoted USA / Poland, while Pillsbury would be USA / USA, without his US State being mentioned - it would be less confusing I think. Any thoughts ? __label__1 You can sign and date tag your contributions with four tildes. A quick point: you give a range of 2880 - 3480, assuming 10% error, but I make 490 x 6 . 3 = 3087, so should not your range be nearer to 2780 - 3380 ? __label__1 So resizing of an image can be only done proportionally, right? I can ' t resize an 8x10 to 8x8 without cropping ? __label__1 I let it accepted for the computation but it seems the link is not the good one as they ' re not talking about levels in this thread. Could you check please ? __label__1 When you say line do you mean character? For the given input what is your desired output ? __label__1 Definitely not, mainly because no such lens exists. Did you mean EF 70 - 200 f / 4 L or EF - S 18 - 200 f / 3 . 5 - 5 . 6 ? __label__1 I hadn ' t heard of this. Googling suggested it ' s something to do with 3GPP ? __label__1 Are there any other limitations on a _ i? for example a _ i >=0 ? __label__1 That ' s four times the capacity of the one you posted a link to, and would be almust five pounds of water on your back. Best of luck finding one, but maybe you should focus on one that ' s easy to refill instead ? __label__1 i made a mistake on adding a colon on <url> and it can ' t be reverted. Could you help ? __label__1 lol thanks. so, australia, huh ? __label__1 You might want to specify what language you ' re trying to do the parsing in - if in C, C#, JavaScript.

Is it OK with you if I go ahead and propose that to Raul ? __label__1 I don ' t understand this sentence "We are to find such placement of this polygons (we could make rotations and movements), when rectangle, which circumscribes this polygons has minimal area."

And am I understanding that you want to extract a column slice as a column matrix, rather than a vector ? __label__1 I ' m starting to feel that the problem arises with interactionPointData, since this method does not own it. Since I am pointing to it with model, will releasing model cause havoc upstream ? __label__1 Indeed. I trust you have already watchlisted this editor ? __label__1 don ' t do that. why would you do that ? __label__1 Just letting you know (since you have mentioned AFDing <url>) that weu2019ve gone to some effort to establish notability with <url>, and have added three reliable, notable, third - party sources to the article. Do you feel these sources establish <url> as being notable (<url> and all that)?__label__1 Hey .. the cookies are fried ! Why the "baking" tag?? :D__label__1 Also: Do you realize that variables created in class scope (in your code, every assignment above `#--..`) are *class variables*, i . e. shared among instances, and not instance variables (`self..`)?__label__1 Moritz - although the yes / no answer to this question is covered by Rice ' s Theorem, see my answer below for more interesting results. Maybe, txwikinger, you should change the question to "What is the complexity of the set {i : L ( M _ i) is in NP}?"?__label__1 sorry what do you mean by processing power ? __label__1 can you please focus your question a bit? Perhaps you could ask what the advantages and disadvantages are for touring in Greece ? __label__1 So your .click listener / handler is functioning correctly (you can do other things within it?) and it ' s only your $.get function that has an issue inside the handler ? __label__1 "..nginx rather than wordpress." Perhaps you mean "nginx rather than Apache"?__label__1 It looks like its not processing the imports in the WSDL. Have you confirmed suds works with external imports ? __label__1 Pizza powder? What ' s that ? __label__1 I would be concerned more with the layout of your data and how you ' re accessing them. Could you paste a sample of 10 rows, and the most common queries you ' re using ? __label__1 Is there any chance you could post some of the code, with an indication of where your break point is?

Glad someone is keeping an eye on me :) I ' m mainly doing stuff over here <url> these days, what are you up to currently? Still concentrating on the Ui Imair ? __label__1 Hi, I ' ve added a question to your RfA. Also, could you elaborate on how you will ''prevent'' vandalism ? __label__1 Perhaps ''polemic'' was an unwise choice of words on my part: I meant it in the very narrow sense of an opposing theologian, but you are right, the more usual sense is of a confrontational piece of writing. I ' ll substitute ''tract''..?__label__1 Hey Dan, I see you around but we haven ' t talked in a bit. What are you up to these days ? __label__1 I would like to hear how this can be done with python.

Or, more specifically, are there files in that directory that you do not want to read ? __label__1 thank you. any clue what happened ? __label__1 Thanks, really useful. But is the foam strictly necessary? What are the disadvantages of not using this ? __label__1 Please rephrase your question with an example of the data and the code. Where is the datastructure you ' re trying to scan ? __label__1 I ' m really very sorry, but no, I ''didn ' t'' know, didn ' t get a message saying that was wrong. Where was it ? __label__1 Could it be that you ' re adding same transaction observer more than once (i . e. for each `addPayment:` statement)?__label__1 At <url>, you ' ve added from Bacon a line saying that the addition of 3 minor judges to the list of major judges brings the total to 12. But the numbers don ' t work out - not in the list in the article, anyway. I don ' t want to revert your good - faith (and referenced) edit, but could you go back to your source and see if you can fix this ? __label__1 Okay, so you just want to get a feel for what ' s out there, and know you want CCK - like functionality. Any other specific features you ' re looking for, or aspects of Drupal that you ' d like to avoid ? __label__1 Is `getFreeCrawler()` synchronized? In which line does the error occur ? __label__1 Title is pretty incoherent.

Are you talking about generating a DC voltage from the PWM ? __label__1 Erica, I understand you are a figure skating enthusiast. Are you still active in those types of articles ? __label__2 Mmm its a little difficult to see on the new one. How about the one on the right ? __label__2 I was just about to point that out.

About my second question: do you know if he campaigned to be elected mayor of Belgrade, or for someone else, or what ? __label__2 I am a bit confused. In the title you ask for a solution without locks and in the question you do want locking ? __label__2 Do you know how many cars are in your q and what their lengths are? Or do you only know that in the moment you need to fit it ? __label__2 Per <url>, there was an autoblock affecting your editing that has now been lifted. Can you edit freely now ? __label__2 I always try to use correct grammar. Why dumb down your correspondence ? __label__2 Setting aside the circumventing of company policies, this is still a question about installing software on a server.

Can you try your example after running `application : start ( sasl).` in your Erlang shell ? __label__2 An article about a craver named <url> needs some work. Can you clean the article up ? __label__2 Class methods, aka "static" methods can be defined like so inside a class: `self . i _ am _ a _ method _ on _ self _ and _ some _ call _ me _ static`. Ps. Are you enjoying Ruby so far? :)__label__2 Do you know any of your classmates? Maybe ask one of them? :)__label__2 Ok well it ' d be a great if it could be confirmed that MSNBC HD will be on DirecTV upon launch. Hey by any chance are you "DodgerKing" on any TV forums such as HighDefForums . com, SatelliteGuys . US or DBSTalk . com ? __label__2 I don ' t understand what it is you ' re trying to do. Could you please expand on your question a little bit ? __label__2 What does the `to _ be _ null _ safe` method do? Does it return an instance of a subclass of `Array`?__label__2 I don ' t think it should be closed, it should only be reformulated in an other way. A possible reformulation could be "Is Flash still worth to use for future development or should we only use HTML 5 ?".__label__2 Hi, that "Multics Virtual Memory: Concepts and Design" paper is already in the list of Multics papers (in the "Further Reading - Technical Details) - it even has the same URL! It only lists one source, though - perhaps the second could be added as an "(also here)" link ? __label__2 It _was_ a homework, but few minutes ago there was a deadline (solutions should be submited online), so I am interested in solution, because I couldn ' t find any (solution wont ' t be presented in class and I am interested how to solve this problem). So, I thought I don ' t need to use _homework_ tag, do I ? __label__2 OK, the 3920th is done. Any further thoughts ? __label__2 Unsurprisingly, there ' s -1 "I don ' t agree" happening everywhere in this thread. People, can we please just keep it to "+1 I agree" or "0 I don ' t agree"?__label__2 Sorry but that is currently covered by NDA. Would my previous projects be satisfactory ? __label__2 If you have archives to look through, can you double - check if this quote indeed comes from this article?

Am I missing something ? __label__2 hi - i added the JS i have. but its not server side so all three images load ?__label__2 Ah okay. In that case I ' m going to tag it for deletion as a redundant redirect, if that ' s okay with you ? __label__2 If your lists have more than 12 items, then collisions are inevitable, because there are more then 2**32 permutations of them. Or do your permutations have any particular properties which mean that there are fewer ? __label__2 Javascript running in a browser doesn ' t have access to the underlying file system for security reasons, but this could be accomplished if you ' re talking about server - side JS (such as node . js). Are you? :)__label__2 Welcome to bicycles . se, CyclingWolf. Do you mean 27x1 . 25 tires ? __label__2 Does the command lines work when ran from python manage . py shell? Does the pb occur when the site is served with python manage . py runserver ? __label__2 In the browsers I ' ve tested (Chrome, Firefox and Epiphany on GTK under Linux) the rich text edit area automatically resizes to the size of the window. Is this not the case for you ? __label__2 The short answer is no, there ' s no such thing as `static` in Ruby. Why not let the database handle your auto - incrementing key ? __label__2 I ' ve been told that a Banana can take up to two hours to digest but I didn ' t believe this is true. Why is it that Pro Tennis players are always eating Bananas ? __label__2 What is the problem? Does the timer continue to count down ? __label__2 You don ' t alter the code of Views to add a new sort criteria: you create a module that implements the new criteria. Are you sure there isn ' t already a similar sort criteria ? __label__2 I don ' t know much about gwt, but if the above methods exist, there should be a function to get the scrollX and scrollY just like in javascript. Then you would combine all of the above to be event . getNativeEvent().getClientY()-image . getElement().getAbsoluteTop()-(document . scrollTop?)__label__2 @Billy: Assume you would start as my colleague today and would have to touch this code. How would you know that you cannot use virtual methods in this particular class ? __label__2 What logic does the conversion follow? Divide by 100 ? __label__2 convert it to float? Catch the error and report to the user ? __label__2 No answer yet.. If you can post a pic I might be able to understand better the relationship of the plastic board to the drain and the concrete.

Does that make sense ? __label__2 By literal value, do you mean the string? Or the ascii integer value ? __label__2 Can you be a bit more specific about what you want in the two result arrays?

The times I looked it wasn ' t using very many conditions; what did you see ? __label__2 Anyone please? A response ? __label__2 How is myIntersections used? Do the elements point to doubles in another vector ? __label__2 I would also alter the title; currently it looks like an auto spambot. Maybe 'How to develop a concept and gain funding' might be good ? __label__2 How are you performing the AJAX request? Could you show some code ? __label__2 Where abouts are you going to be coding the Parser? In excel ? __label__2 The browser should take care of caching. Perhaps you have yours set to not keep a cache ? __label__2 Get rid of everything except the first die() line.

Can you give an example input and the desired output ? __label__2 I see that he just re - added the old article in there at first, but by the time we got to the end, it was significantly changed.

Or I misunderstood your instruction ? __label__2 Can you help with this user: http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Special : Contributions / Wallak I suspect that it is sockpuppet of banned user Bonaparte and he vandalizing various articles related to Romanians and Vlachs.

I can ' t remove it from him as I ' m involved, ANI ? __label__2 While tante ' s answer should cover your question, one meta - comment to it: It would be much easier to answer if you added your rationale to your question. Maybe there is a work around to your problem not consisting of preventing deletion of the file ( s)?__label__2 @Haoest: It seems some friendly individual already edited the title to remove the "gay image". Have you tried a different threshold ? __label__2 @Thomas: It does seem to have a certain similarity, but that doesn ' t really explain the reason to close. What about that sequence is unworthy of being in a question ? __label__2  ( We need to be IM - ing or something.) What is your opinion of spin - off articles ? __label__2 How about through basement / crawl space, attic, behind baseboards? Or are all of these out of the question ? __label__2 @zebonaut I ' m attaching here the pic of the backside of the circuit http://i . stack . imgur . com / BDBRS . jpg . Please take a look at the 55 pins, the output which is no . 3 is not connected to any part of the board? Could it be they just placed the pin to confuse ? __label__2 The problem statement is, unfortunately, not clear at all. Can you ask for clarification ? __label__2 You may want to look at the changelog for ActiveRecord (http://ar . rubyonrails . org / files / CHANGELOG . html) and see if anything listed there might apply to your situation. Also, what Ruby version are you running ? __label__2 The logic that determines the Fields from the HTML is not obvious.

Do you know a maximum length of the input stream ? __label__2 Which part is failing?

What output do you get ? __label__2 did you set the classpath in `Publish Settings > Flash > ActionScript 3 . 0 Settings > Source Path`? are you debugging in a browser ? __label__2 How is the structure "the same"?

Can we put it down to being a life skill ? __label__2 It ' s unclear how "regression" could be invoked in a *univariate* dataset. Also, exactly what distinction are you suggesting between the two bulleted methods ? __label__2 I think the story is worth recording, and I could add several more references. I have to ask.. are you related to Boyds, Smileys, or Souters ? __label__2 Do you still feel there is a POV / NPOV dispute on the article? Do you feel mediation is still needed ? __label__2 Can I help update this bank or does it not need any updating??__label__2 I ' m confused by this sentence - "I ' m looking for an algorithm that will simplify and smooth the polygon, (reducing the number of vertices) with the constraint that the resulting polygon must contain all the vertices of the detailed polygon.". How do you reduce the number of vertices, yet retain them all ? __label__2  ( 1) “Transitive closure” sounds as if you are looking for something like R∪R^2∪R^3∪…, but I guess that this is not the case and that you are looking for the H - representation of R^k for a given k. Am I right? (2) Sorry for my ignorance, but what is an open polytope ? __label__2 Looking at Kotorkid ' s contributions on <url>, three hours seems too short for a block. Considering that their three and only edits were all vandalism, would you support an indef - block for vandalism - only account for them ? __label__2 02 : 33, 25 February 2008 24 . 47 . 208 . 127 (Talk) (58 , 755 bytes) (u2192Suicide: added external link to Marlborough Gallery (Marlborough Fine Art)) (undo)--is this the place for a link to this gallery site?

What did you find when you searched ? __label__2 You mentioned OWASP, but not their [Web Application Firewall](http://ww . owasp . org / index . php / Web _ Application _ Firewall).

Or did you create the new username first, before asking me to change your old one ? __label__2 They aren ' t common for fairly good reasons. Is there a particular reason you need such a supply ? __label__2 I take it from your example that what needs to be indexed is a list `m` entries taken from a set of `n` known elements? Is a lookup table feasible ? __label__2 What kind of data are you expecting? Another float or printed output ? __label__2 Are you looking for 3d models? Or 3d looking 2d images ? __label__2 DOM elements don ' t have names per - se (although some tags such as `input` can have an attribute `name`). Could you elaborate on your requirements ? __label__2 How have you stored it in the database? Are the strokes stored as XML ? __label__2 I removed your prod, but on second thought, he ' s <url>. Do you want to send this to AfD ? __label__2 What kind of `N` are we talking about here? i . e. what ' s the maximum number of bits to sort ? __label__2 What do you think about the character section? Think we should add a few more / take away Ona Nobis and Zan Arbor ? __label__2 It seems to me that the constraints may be arbitrary and affect an arbitrary number of other options in an arbitrary number of groups. So it ' s the arbitrary constraints that give you difficulty here ? __label__2 What ' s the context? Is this homework ? __label__2 You ' re a math teacher, right? May I ask what grade level ? __label__2 Ah, sorry, my mistake. However, at least on Snow Leopard, it ' s RunAtLoad, not RunAtLaunch -- or am I making the next mistake here? :-)__label__2 Is there any content that needs rescuing? The only edit I seem to have deleted was the redirect ? __label__2 onestep:> Good point Adam>: do you have access to the underlying data ? Or at least to the standard errors arround each slope ?__label__2 +1 intersting. Do you know (read somewhere) they are gonna shut down also Yahoo site explorer ? __label__2 I ' d like not to receive any notices from this bot on my talk page. Is there a way to do this ? __label__2 What if there ' s 7 pages, and you ' re on page 4? `[1]..[2][3][x][5][6]..[7]`?__label__2 @Federico : This part defines a schema in the wsdl. Does it import one or defines it there ? __label__2 I ' m leaving <url> to Karanacs because I ' m too close to the topic in bad ways. I ' m uncertain whether images are clear, so please drop a note on the FAC before Karanacs goes through on Tuesday ? __label__2 I see! By the way, this doesn ' t seem to make sense: "Simon was hired as a writer, becoming showrunner by the age of 23." Simon must have been 23 in 1978, so either the birth date is wrong or he ' s lying about his age ? __label__2 Hey, I noticed you protected the article <url> from being recreated. Will you be able to reverse that If I recreate the article with sourced, factual, real world content ? __label__2 Wow does that mean we can cut <url> into a small stub :) ??__label__2 This page is new, the result of a move - the page it moved from is now a redirect to <url>, but the history which goes with it is at the page I asked to be deleted. Can you delete the page, while copying the history over to the article ? __label__2 I haven ' t tagged / assessed anything in quite some time. Which article are you referring to ? __label__2 Hi there again, just reminding you that the review must be archived over at WP : Biography as well, not only marked as such in the article Talk page. Do you think Markus ' s last concern was addressed to his satisfaction ? __label__2 This wouldn ' t explain all the problems, but the discrepancies may be related to syncing. Have you looked at your autosync preferences ? __label__2 So, your IDE is Eclipse. Have you checked that the JAR file is present at the _Project > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries_ page ? __label__2 What do you mean by smaller? Do you mean truncating the string ? __label__2 So you want the individual "points" in your final Perlin - noise - shaped function to have a random distribution instead of the normal distribution? And do this while still having a perlin - shaped map ? __label__2 are you sure, that textView isn ' t null already? Could you provide an error message ? __label__2 Just in case you haven ' t seen it. I wondered if you might even respond to the comments there ? __label__2 Where is the call to the child ' s function? (Did you mean to put a function1() somewhere?)__label__2 Can you show your appenders? Are you using the `ConsoleAppender`?__label__2 I vote that they stay, given that even though they ' re not "Recurring" in and of themselves, they ' re part of a recurring phenomenon, which is Stephen doing "Better Know a District" spin - offs. So, maybe we should re - group them under a heading of "Spin - Offs" in the "BKaD" section ? __label__2 It ' s cool (<url>), but the high resolution vs. seems to be different, see <url>. Hmm why ? __label__2 sorry to extend the question, but how would i block the ip address? (using PHP?)__label__2 Here ' s the FFD page: <url>. How do you know that the photograph was made pursuant to a law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business ? __label__2 What level of security do you need? Does it have to stop the NSA ? __label__2 Voting to close on the grounds this is not a constructive question. A sentence could be, for example, an answer to someone asking **"What ' s the first [or n ' th] letter of the alphabet?"**__label__2 OK.. ctrl+v behaves differently. What possible use is the local file location to a webapp though ? __label__2 O . K, I ' ve done a simplified version and stuck it on that page. Comments ? __label__2 just a simple question: if you created a simple `Foo` object, how will you be able to cast it to `Foo<T>`? From where should it have the additional `Data`?__label__2 Thanks for adding the bold title and the 2 categories, but can you please explain your thoughts on the tone? I mean, can you give me a specific part or just the whole article ? __label__2 There ' s a basis for your hypothesis: see http://photo . stackexchange . com / questions / 4115 / problem - with - fluorescent - lighting - and - shutter - speed for examples and a discussion. Do you also see color shifts towards yellow or green ? __label__2 What does a `print $link;` *inside the controller*? Is the variable set correctly ? __label__2 Would it be acceptable to also note that all of the below are examples of somehow obscuring taking [deity]'s name in vain? One might say that 'holy smoke' (as an example of a veiled taking of a name in vain) would predate the Third Commandment ? __label__2 I think my EF 20 / 2 . 8 prime would qualify as wide angle, if I only used it on a FF body rather than APS - C, where it becomes a long wide angle or short normal lens (32 mm FF equivalent). Perhaps you really meant wide - angle *zoom* lenses vs tele and prime ? __label__2 This is my first time at review - sorry if I blew it. The article passes just fine--what do I do at DYK to indicate that ? __label__2 What do you mean by 'other types of elements'? How would you determine the values of the other types ? __label__2 I am trying to use <url> but can ' t find "Preview on first edit" to set it and when I use the tool I can ' t find "Start CommonsHelper". Can you help ? __label__2 I rephrased a bit to make the intent I read in the original more clear. @wdypdx22 what do you think ? __label__2 What actually happens? Have you tried placing a breakpoint on Response . Redirect ? __label__2 Surely that would mean each camera only received half as much light? Wouldn ' t that be a problem ? __label__2 @kalle43 All movement / displacements happens on a plane correct? Can you confirm this is a 2D problem ? __label__2 A user bar is not specific to WordPress, it ' s a HTML element with some links, the bar here for example is actually just an element sat inside the header, with a background that gives the impression of a bar ( nothing spectacular). Do you want an example of how to create a div with some links in it ? __label__2 It should be deleted. Do you want to nominate it or should I ? __label__2 In what way has it "disappeared"? Do you mean it no longer appears as a shortcut icon on the home screen ? __label__2 The fastest way depends strongly how the bitmaps are stored before the algorithm. NxM Matrix or bitfields or ? __label__2 I don ' t get the "defaultsort" edit you mention - can you link me to a specific edit showing this? Also, if I rename the template will it be automatically changed on the relevant coaches' pages or do I need to do this myself ? __label__2 A trivial solution is that at each point of time, you simply generate an event that has been generated too rarely so far, breaking ties arbitrarily, but I guess you have already considered that. Perhaps you could explain what problems this approach has in your application ? __label__2 I suspect this is a topcoder problem. What ' s the limit for input size, in this case ? __label__2 Per the TFD debate, would you think it a reasonable solution to redirect this e . g. to <person>?__label__2 That ' s fine. Question: how did you find that out ? __label__2 I have it ready now. Would there be any policy violations if I upload the image over the protected one ? __label__2 Do you mean you need real world use cases for these data structures? Or do you need explanations of how they work using examples and metaphors ? __label__2 Please rephrase your question so it doesn ' t admit the trivial answer that was given on mathoverflow. Why do you care ? __label__2 Python says: `NameError: global name 'a' is not defined`. Did you mean `ip _ header _ sum = ~ip _ header _ sum & 0xFF` ?__label__2 I ' m sorry, what distinction are you making between the large sample formula and the small sample formula? Are you calculating the variances using a population formula in large samples rather than using a sample estimate of the population variance ? __label__2 I ' m skeptical that this is possible. In the final version, both operators take the same precedence and are left - associative ? __label__2 Great. How do I find those ? __label__2 Sorry, I don ' t understand what you mean by the second sentence. Would you try and reword it ? __label__2 I presume you just removed every backlink to <url> on accident? Did you need me to revert that real quick ? __label__2 I don ' t quite understand the question. You want a plugin that inserts custom templates defined in plugin ? __label__2 <url> shows that Geo Swan has become active and <url> indicates that the problems mentioned at the RfC may be continuing. Would you close the RfC with the drafted summary ? __label__2 If the procedure for afd / copyvio is the same, that could certainly be possible. Can you please provide a link to the appropriate pages / templates in that language ? __label__2 I don ' t think you can. What is it you need to do ? __label__2 I might have just done a wrong revert on this art - what do you think? Small cf Singapores Changi maybe - but, ..?__label__2 Your closing statement in <url> has been cited as a <url> for the above AfD. Can you make a comment in this discussion ? __label__2 What do you mean by: "we would like to test whether it is an vis - a - vis the general population"? and "single sample S"?__label__2 @Brian - You ' re right, this should be in meta. Would you be willing to start the thread ? __label__2 Very strange, how come I can see all the other posts? How do I clear the cache - do you know ? __label__2 thank you. but, what should i do now ? __label__2 I ' m getting some warnings. Warnings can cause my problem ? __label__2 Hey, I ' m back for a little, but can ' t stay too long - busy day. What ' s up ? __label__2 I plan on getting the page up at some point this weekend, no latter than Monday though for obvious reasons. Why do you ask ? __label__2 As a timid Wikipedia end - user who never makes more than a rare grammatical or spelling edit, learning the history to be found on this talk page and Kate ' s userpage history makes me sad. Why is it that so many communities change the way they do as the size of the project they revolve around increases..?__label__2 You were asking for a source for the <url> mention of the <url> service to Lagos from March 29th, which you reverted. Would <url> do ? __label__2 not sure I agree with your premise, most of the open source raster software I ' m familiar with stores data in files directly. Are their specific features of Image Server you ' re interested in ? __label__2 I ' ve heard about the controversy. What ' s your take on it ? __label__2 Excuse me if this is an ignorant question but which are "summer savory" herbs ? __label__2 "..element 3 was compatible with 1": I don ' t see this in your chart. And if 3 is compatible with 1, why is 1 not compatible with 3 ? __label__2 Do you need it to be zero? Can you assign it the **real** value immediately instead ? __label__2 Okay, I desaturated it just a bit. What do you think of it now ? __label__2 Could you please clarify - did you receive these errors when attempting to boot the new kernel or when attempting to compile the kernel? If the latter, was the compilation performed from within a running system or from an alternate environment such as a live cd ? __label__2 What ' s next? What have you got planned for the next 12 months ? __label__2 You mean access it programatically? Can you post some more details about your problem ? __label__2 @Kiril yes you can, using function pointers. But even then, how ' s that different from passing the struct around to functions ? __label__2 not sure. I ' m new to http, afaik, coz server is designed to serve requests from different mobile platforms, this is to get some consistency ? __label__2 The funny thing is that I thought of commenting something like "nice idea, too bad no one uses Wave" but then thought I shouldn ' t be a jackass, maybe other people do. Turns out I was right the first time, eh ? __label__2 I don ' t want to be a troll here (the type on a bridge, not in a forum). Can you explain what you intend to use AWB for ? __label__2 Please define private and secure. Do you mean that it is well patched and maintained, do you mean that it is encrypted, do you mean that it has a strong authentication / access controls system ? __label__2 Very interesting question, I hope this eventually gets some answers! Are you talking only about *disclosure*, or economic factors in improving security in general ? __label__2 It does have a reference *somewhere*, but I don ' t know where. Come think of it, isn ' t this the kind of thing decided by the JVM ? __label__2 And how do you want the words to be sent? Each word separately, or the text as a whole ? __label__2 How are you getting the parameters? How are you calling the exe ? __label__2 I don ' t like the idea of switching the order halfway through, especially as you would you have to decide an arbitrary cut - off point. Perhaps you should raise this on <url>, and see what people think ? __label__2 What happens when you set a breakpoint in the code for the assembly? Does it have a question mark in it ? __label__2 These edits appear to be related to the same issue that caused the page to be protected. Could you please explain why you are doing this ? __label__2 So you ' re just looking to map the characters into another character? Sort of like a Ceaser Cipher ? __label__2 I wasn ' t home, but I sent you an e - mail answering the questions asked. Did you receive it ? __label__2 @Asdfg: okay it ' s not a unit test then. Integration testing ? __label__2 That ' s an odd choice of name. Any particular reason for that ? __label__2 It isn ' t clear to me that he knew WHO Amorrow was, someone has left a message that will hopefully set him straight. Do you have a link to the blog ? __label__2 Jvhertum, Last year you made this change :http://en . wikipedia . org / w / index . php ? title=A _ Split - Second & action=historysubmit & diff=343316267 & oldid=343252107 to the <url> article with the justification that "A is part of the name". This does not appear to be a valid reason to exclude it (<url> has a DEFAULTSORT of Beatles despite 'The' being part of the name), your thoughts ?__label__2 Take a larger number of samples? Display "calculating" until you get enough samples ? __label__2 what devices do you want to connect to your phone? A keyboard would be nice huh ? __label__2 Found some more information which likely explains it: http://rt . openssl . org / Ticket / Display . html ? id=1497 & user=guest & pass=guest -- still not sure how I can work around it. Maybe `keytool` can be used instead ? __label__2 It would be even funnier if you did attend the rally but weren ' t the giant tea bag guy I added to your user page. Did you ? __label__2 @Atishay- It seems that you ' ve changed the requirements of the problem to work with o ( N) space (little - o of N here). Any reason for the change ? __label__2 I ' m getting a little nervous that the FAC ' s not attracting much attention. You know FAC much better than I do, should I be worried yet ? __label__2 Hi. Do you have any thoughts on <url>?__label__2 I strongly agree with deleting poorly sourced articles, articles about people in the news enjoying their 15 minutes of fame, memorials, articles merely linking to the subjects website, articles about internet phenomena which are sourced onlyu to blogs or fansites. We are in accord on many things, but I have one question: On your user page you say "The name of my dog is not "human knowledge"-it ' s unverifiable ." Shouldn ' t you have quotes around "Unverifiable," if that ' s what you call your dog ? __label__2 I got rid of the non - notable entries. What else needs to be done ? __label__2 @cantrem: Yes, that ' s what I meant, just a direct rebuild after it fails. What happens if you change any other line and try to recompile ? __label__2 For some reason, <url> states to notify people on the talk page. I think the idea is to avoid self - references for the reader, but then the clean - up tags already alert the reader to other things, so this seems OK. Do you want to ask about using this at <url>?__label__2 Hi, this will seem a little odd, but your name seems very familiar. Did you ever play an online game named <url> by chance ? __label__2 Hi Mike--The above article has now been looked at by two folks who have marked it "good article." How do I either get rid of the unreviewed article tag or get whatever feedback I need. I have left notes at the request for feedback page twice now . Can you help ? __label__2 Are there any duplicate values? Do you know the range of values (i . e., 1 < x < 300)?__label__2 How are you creating a row in your flat table? If you recreate the view after you add the data does it show up ? __label__2 Would you please make the question more clear? Do you want `\BRallowhypbch` activated when you set `\emergencystretch`?__label__2 Hi, welcome to Wikipedia. Could you explain in your <url> just ''what'' a Universiade is ? __label__2 Can you specify what operating system? Windows, Linux, Mac ? __label__2 What problem are you having? Is this page in a public place where we can see it ? __label__2 There are actually a lot of different ice - cream maker recipes that will produce very different overruns; can you specify how you ' re preparing yours ? __label__2 Ok, I ' d agree about <url> being better. Should I delete the other one (you could also tag it for speedy deletion as a mistake)?__label__2 sorry I changed it to _mockDbFactory . Object. is what what you were referring to ? __label__2 isn ' t your regex working at line level, as e . g. in perl ? __label__2 I ' m working on Debra <url>, but I ' m worried at how I ' m doing on the article and the "title" of the references. They are really long, like "Monthly Weather Review - Volume 107 - Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1978 - page 6" - is that okay for a reference name ? __label__2 I have just reported a high level of Vandalism at the page <url>. Is it possible to impose a temporary protection to the page ? __label__2 @chi Sorry for the confusion, I meant a proportion for forest cover, and a binary indicator for presence or absence at each country. I think I get what you are saying here, would the assumption of not having an evolving generating model essentially be an assumption of 'stationarity'?__label__2 This is a duplicate question with 2536194. Can they be combined ? __label__2 i cant use 6x3 as there are 600 x 300 possible points. I suppose the better question is what could I apply to show that it scaled properly ? __label__2 Does this second batch stay in the Task Queue forever? What does the ETA column say, are all the tasks in the second batch overdue ? __label__2 This question is a little bit vague. Could you clarify please ? __label__2 Is this homework? Have you tried to work out how much storage each approach would require ? __label__2 But… isn ’ t $(\mathbf { NP}^{\mathbf { NP}})^{\mathbf { NP}}$ the same as $\mathbf { NP}^{\mathbf { NP}}$? Or am I missing something here ? __label__2 This would be answered in pretty much any beginner ' s tutorial, and I fear a complete answer here would undermine your understanding more than help. What prior effort have you done to learn ? __label__2 Still thinking. What do you suggest ? __label__2 I see. Maybe you should have updated the version to 1 . 0 . 1 (or something like that) to indicate that it is a new version? :)__label__2 OK, lets get a screenshot then. What is your keyboard layout, is it a qwerty keyboard ? __label__2 I would take a look at the question what - security - risks - does - ip - spoofing - bring . I feel these questions are very similar, if not duplicate ? __label__2 Moving the cable around and such I have not been able to spontaneously reproduce the issue, however it is happening a bit less frequently now.. still annoying though! If this question is better placed in SuperUser, could someone move it please ? __label__2 Also: every app has XSS that could be displayed as HTML, XML, or a future markup language. Do you seriously want to have that argument ? __label__2 I ' ve been "busy" (all day today in Death Valley admiring the spring bloom), and I would like to get at least partial buyin from HG if possible. Not a big hurry to rename, right ? __label__2 Can you please focus your question on security topics? Is your question specifically wrt ASLR, or is it something else ? __label__2 Should `second highest` be `second _ highest`? Is there a loop ? __label__2 I was wondering why you removed him from Category : Alameda. He ' s pretty famous around there and it would be notable to have him in the category of Alameda, wouldn ' t it ? __label__2 You are saying that the "minimize control" was missing. Which device are you trying that on - and which iOS version is installed ? __label__2 The bytes download in simulator is different from the bytes downloaded in the device.. Just checked while debugging. Any idea why it is doing so??__label__2 As an outsider, I thought that the thrust of Floydian ' s edit was good, but it was a little terse in its wording (I ' ve been guilty of such overly terse writing myself). Rather than reverting with such an insulting edit, perhaps Coolcaeser could simply copyedit Floydian ' s text ? __label__2 Do you need to get lighter than a pure, fully saturated version of the hue? I . E. if your hue is pure green, should an input of 1 return #00ff00 or should it return #feffe ? __label__2 Yes, I do, but Norris is generally better. What points / issues do you think it should also cover ? __label__2 The other possibility is that it ' s just fringe history. I ' ll take a look over the few resources relating to ''Texas'' that I have and see whether that is the case ? __label__2 Voting to close as off - topic. http://math . stackexchange . com maybe ? __label__2 woow.. sorry but this is ugly, ugly, ugly. Why do this if other packages already do the work for you ? __label__2 I ' m testing it using the simulator. I can ' t find anywhere in the simulator to disable daylight saving ? __label__2 <url> is up for deletion. Can you find some sources in Belarusian ? __label__2 I thought I ' d asked you nicely on <url> not to make further attempts at getting your point into the article without trying to find consensus. Could you please address my points on the talkpage before having further tries in the article itself ? __label__2 You suggest that the process occurs with replacement. Does this mean that you allow multidigraphs (with possibly multiple arcs from s to t)?__label__2 What do you mean by "leaking" ? Allocating memory and never deallocating it ?__label__2 I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around "naming" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?__label__2 This is interesting. Have you tried calling them and asking wherefor art thou WSDL ? __label__2 What do you mean by "detect" exactly? What do you want to do in reaction, show a scrollbar ? __label__2 Are the holes only orthogonal connected? Or is diagnonal also allowed ? __label__2 What about good old Boundschecker and Purify? Are they stil the leading apps ? __label__2 What language are you trying to do this in? What have you tried ? __label__2 Nice, but it overlaps notifications. Could you move them under the sticky bar ? __label__2 Are you trying to return a screenshot of the windows desktop of the server you are running your website on? It seems the only legit use of imagegrabscreen() - also take a peek at: http://php . oregonstate . edu / manual / en / function . imagegrabscreen . php - there are some notes at the bottom about setting proper permissions to be able to capture the screen - has that been done ? __label__2  " the client encrypts the password with this algorithm" - how do you do the check on the server later? are you storing plain passwords ? __label__2 So the size of [-5,-2] is -2 - (-5) = 3? Wouldnt [12,-2] with -2 - 12 = -14 be better ? __label__2 Well, I do have one question. If I were to come across a page that I would normally mark as a CSD- like copyright infringement, etc, as an admin can I just delete it or do I need to mark it CSD and ask another opinion ? __label__2 There ' s so much of work related to Prague: I once created <url> but every bridge in Prague deserves an article. Why not work on this or other topics ? __label__2 I added a simple out . println() message to the location where I am calling redirect and that output appears before any other output from the response. So shouldn ' t I be allowed to redirect at that point ? __label__2 Do all the points make up a single pattern? Or are you looking for multiple patterns in the same list of points ? __label__2 Well, if you have a O ( V+E) algorithm, I ' m really interested! Could you post it here ? __label__2 The default zoom would show the whole image filling all of the available space in the control. Are you asking then how to center either the vertical or the horizontal when the image aspect doesn ' t match the controls aspect ? __label__2 Would you please elaborate for a C++ noob? What actual problems have you run into ? __label__2  " Chlorophyll", not "chlorofyl". Can someone with rep to edit please correct ? __label__2 so i partially understand. I took out version jquery version 1 . 3 . 2., but how do I update jquery version 1 . 4 . 2 so it works with the fading images function ? __label__2 What is the column name in the Role model? What does the line of code that outputs this message look like ? __label__2 I ' ve never seen any wrist - only ones. Can somebody provide a link to one of them ? __label__2 It seems this could actually occur easily if the user copy - pasted the null character in. (Maybe the user got it from a website or Word doc?)__label__2 @ROM1 - Yes I can implement HTTP. Is there any solution for HTTP ? __label__2 My contribution tried to show the impression to others I ' am only trying to improve spelling. What ' s the difference between personel and persona ? __label__2 Hey, I just noticed <url>, and something doesn ' t seem right. What should be done ? __label__2 The question is a variation of the "which is best"-question to which the chat - room seems better suited. Can ' t we open a marketing - 101 - stackexchange on that ? __label__2 if you set the OptimizedDoubleBuffer flag you must also set the UserDraw flag. Have you tried that ? __label__2 LOL, I love that movie. So, are you having Chinese food for New Year ' s Eve ? __label__2 Too general? Perhaps this should relate to a specific problem: "How are monte carlo simulations used to model _x_ in physics?"__label__2 Hey, if you took this picture you can release it into the public domain. If not, do you know who took it ? __label__2 That depends upon the audience. Beginners, of professional programmers in some other language ? __label__2 Hi, do you have a nationality for ''Belpamela''? If so, would you add the relevant flag ? __label__2 Is your host only blocking you from editing your php . ini? If so can you set the memory in the script using ini _ set('memory _ limit', 64);?__label__2 input [2 , 4,-1 , 1] output: 2. Are you sure the answer is 2 and not 3 ? __label__2 Just parents / children, or all ancestors / descendants? Also, which flavour of SQL are you using ? __label__2 Can you post the actual calls you ' re making (the types and their `ToString` implementations may be important). Also, your `RollingFileAppender` configuration and how often is "sometimes"?__label__2 3 . 1 is in beta, it ' s less likely for documentation to exist for functionality that is subject to change. Don ' t get me wrong though, i ' d be curious to see some examples myself in anticipation of 3 . 1.. (i tend to use the stable branch as i spend more time supporting whatever the majority of users are on).. (or is this in 3 . 0 . 2?)__label__2 This is a [1985 Bridgestone 700](http://ww . sheldonbrown . com / bridgestone / 1985 / pages / 07 - bridgestone - 700 . html). @Paul, is this your bike ? __label__2 No worries - the only thing I see holding up promotion is whether the ejectionsite website qualifies as a <url> or not. Can you tell me if the author ' s work has been cited elsewhere (like in books) or he is considered to be an expert in the field ? __label__2 I deleted the redirects <url> and <url> that were a result of the page moves. Is that all you needed ? __label__2 I don ' t think I understand--is there a question here? Can you re - phrase ? __label__2 This is sort of a vague question. What sort of correspondence are you looking for ? __label__2 Yes, I can vouch for <url> since she taught me when I was doing my undergrad! :) Have all these been restored ? __label__2 You can use it quickly cut a straight cut on a 2x4 with a circular saw. Any other uses ? __label__2 Its not. But if it were balanced, is there an optimum way ? __label__2 I don ' t think there is handy enough import into Google Calendar. Would WP dashboard widget work for you ? __label__2 Are you running a program locally that must rename files on a remote system via SSH? Or can you install and run a program on the target system ? __label__2 What do you plan to do if every number has been generated?

When a user is blocked, is their IP address blocked also ? __label__2 I haven ' t seen the LBE code, does it give any more information about why it won ' t initialize? Also, is the hardware list up there complete, or are there any other sensors / whatnot connected ? __label__2 I ' ll do so then. What ' s the procedure ? __label__2 how do I edit the signature thing? - when i put the ~s ? __label__2 Replied on my talk. BTW, do you have access to the paid NYT articles or any of the paid newspaper archives ? __label__2 As a rough look over, the splits look ok to me (although yes, more discussion before forking is generally a good thing). If you think there are serious problems with them, why not just address it on the talk page ? __label__2 @Mithun "*I must agree with you because there is a possibility that the asker may misunderstand the first phrase by insisting the context of what I explained for a situation where the context what you suggested would be needed*" - I asked this question without having any context at hand, I just happened to hear both phrases and wasn ' t sure if they meant the same thing. My main point here is this: Would you say "Bend your knees, please" to someone if you want him to squat down ? __label__2 Can you provide your own application (even a small one), or is it only web based? Also, is it acceptable to popup user / password dialogs ? __label__2 I added two marks (A and B).

How can anything be more than 100% opaque ? __label__2 Is your desired result just the SQL statement with all the parameter placeholders substituted with their values? Or did you still want the `DECLARE` statements included, similar to the LINQPad output in my response ? __label__2 Executed fine here, using perl, v5 . 10 . 1 (*) built for x86 _ 64 - linux - gnu - thread - multi. Any encoding issues or anything with the text you ' re testing / comparing to ? __label__2 Thanks - does it actually make any difference in the rendered article whether <person> or <person> is used to link for a category? Obviously the latter allows easier entry (one less parameter) but I can ' t see that it makes any functional difference, once the template processes the parameters ? __label__2 @Alexander this is a little bit of an argumentative question. Do you think you could phrase it better ? __label__2 I think <url> will require checkuser intervention. How do I relist it ? __label__2 I ' m having the same problem on Xoom 3 . 1. Can anybody confirm this is a bug ? __label__2 Do you need to do this more than once in your program? And do you need more levels of indirection, such as `foo . baz . qux . name == foo . name`?__label__2 Check your references, do you have a reference to the output of the project, ie. a "reference to itself"?__label__2 for what purpose? why not just generate an API key and use that ? __label__2 First off, great work at the <url> article. I ' m just wondering why you changed the sentence back to "During this period, defense expenditures underwent exponential growth allowing an unprecedent level of weapon acquisitions and the rapid expansion of the <url>." from "During this period, defense expenditures underwent exponential growth allowing an unprecedent level of weapon acquisition and expansion of the <url>." The version I changed it to is more grammarically correct, don ' t you think ? __label__2 What will be the input like if date is missing?

Do you mean, how do you measure the length of the red or blue lines ? __label__2 It seems like this area of the photo is out of focus, in which case the only fix is to bring it into focus.

What ' s in `$query _ string` and where do you get it from ? __label__2 JQuery has many lightbox implementation. have you thought about scraping the proto lightbox and porting to a jquery based one ? __label__2 @jmiller: Do you get any javascript errors? Have you opened firebug to see the differences in the data being retrieved via AJAX ? __label__2 I write to you, because I think that this issue should be addressed at some central place - for all lists / rankings, so that we don ' t have to go over the same discussion separately at each place. Could you arrange such discussion or point me where to raise the issue ? __label__2 Your question seems quite strange, given that if you want to find all the paths and their costs, you can just enumerate them and sum the edges costs to get the total cost. Maybe you want the shortest path ? __label__2 How does it look? Also, did you read my inquiry <url>?__label__2 Sorry my browser can ' t load the page to the book. Can you mention the name ? __label__2 Almost a month has passed. You still up for it ? __label__2 Ok, thanks.

Can you please elaborate on this ? __label__2 Somewhere I ' ve got a Twins program from a few years ago that had a cover - story interview with Harmon Killebrew. Would that be a valid source, or would a game program ' s here - today - gone - tomorrow nature raise questions about it ? __label__2 Sorry @atdre still somewhat confused. Using SSL would only help with applications that used SSL on the end, not with determining OS version or type or portscanning or anything like that, right ? __label__2 Clever devil. Do you eat picalilli in Scotland or is that a Brit thing ? __label__2 Sure thing. Did you see my note higher up on the page ? __label__2 Not sure what app you ' re talking about.

What exactly is going wrong ? __label__2 I think the NVidia requirement alone makes that unacceptable for me, but if not, doesn ; t Cude require compilation using nvcc command? Or can I compile with MS VS 2005 ? __label__2 Is the number of views fixed? Are you trying to line the views up into columns ? __label__2 a real story to define this concern: I have an app that is working on data from api . stackoverflow on one thread while working on data from api . stackapps on another.

Are you looking to create a list of nested groups for each group in manner which doesn ' t break if a circular reference exists OR are you simply searching for groups that are involved ina circular loop ? __label__2 In the one that works, you ' ve got a space between the URL and `no - repeat`.

Your CodingHorror link points to couchdb . org ? __label__2 There ' s almost certainly a better question to be asked lurking under this one. Why do you want to change the Xorg video driver? :)__label__2 How long is "Wait for debugger.." on the screen? What processor is on your computer ? __label__2 Sounds like a projection issue. Is the shapefile projected to a different coordinate system than you ' re used to using ? __label__2 do you mean the apparent brightness? as in a grayscale ? __label__2 can you provide a bit more context, please?

Krishna, does it have anything to do with cars (or maps?)__label__2 Although I have no detailed knowledge of the matter, it ' s my understanding that the BIOS source code appeared in the "purple book" that IBM provided to other companies under NDA. Did IBM publish it more openly than that ? __label__2 What is the "management team" on the <url>? Is that me, because I performed the rollover ? __label__2 I have added some reliable sources for the article. Can I remove the proposed deletion tag ? __label__2 So which part art you having trouble with? What ' s your question ? __label__2 I am looking at your article on <url>, and noticed that you are the author of a change suggesting that sec61 transports extra peptides not displayed by MHC Class I into cytosol.

Perhaps we could make a separate template to show only the Cenozoic or so, which would allow us to show more detail in these fossil ranges ? __label__2 Sounds like a good plan. Do you think DRYLOK is a good or bad thing to do on the walls ? __label__2 Where is the CGI script located? Are you using a web server started as a system service or under your user account on the same machine ? __label__2 Also, you state that 2^|rules| is too many computational steps. What about |options in group 1| * |options in group 2| .. * |options in group k|?__label__2 Huh, I ' ve never actually bothered to use Google Book search. I ' ll e - mail you some stuff shortly, but here ' s another topic for thought: can we find any more stylistic characteristics for the genre aside from its association with underground art, its roots in punk and punk forms (hardcore and post - punk), and the fact that, judging by their lyrics, a lot of the artists seem to be miserable bastards (I love how the 1990 EW link makes a point of this)?__label__2 But the LoadWith - to my understanding should eliminate the lazy - load problem of serialization. What ' s more weird is that it ' s actually returned by a WCF service so It should already be serialized -right ? __label__2 What have you tried so far? Is there something more subtle than just opening both files, reading lines from each, etc ? __label__2 What are "the proper elements"? Are you given *two* matrices, one the "source" matrix and one a "target" matrix and you must decide in which order to "encounter" the elements so as to get the "target" matrix ? __label__2 Delete away; the SVG ' s done :) How would you like it licensed? PD ? __label__2 I can ' t tell how you get 216 for 99. And by 'denary' do you mean 'decimal' perhaps ? __label__2  " given a text file as input": And what ' s in that text file ..?

What do you think ? __label__2 @Shinto: Isn ' t the purpose of an English - usage Q & A site to answer questions? As opposed to telling people "Go look up the answer"?__label__2 The code you show should work fine and not overwrite anything. Why do you suspect it is not working ? __label__2 How connected is the figure? Is there a path between any two squares (without using diagonals)?__label__2 I can ' t seem to find the mention. Do you know what page ? __label__2 thanks. Please, can you rephrase your question as answers to each specific subquestion ? __label__2 Ah, so next time I don ' t have to include "Places". Are there more specific categories I could use instead of "Places"?__label__2 Hi the table you removed was added after a discussion <url>, so please give us a reason why you removed it??__label__2 I ' ve now blocked them as the account appears to be used only for vandalism. Since your username is prone to being mis - spelled can I suggest you set up some "dead" <url> accounts to pre - empt further impersonations ? __label__2 So I think it ' s better research one by one and decide which one is common name (use). What is your opinion ?__label__2 I thought it was solved? Would you please put the content of your file ~/.gtkrc - 2 . 0 ?__label__2 Are you getting any console errors ? Did you also download the .js file ?__label__2 And you can qualify for multiple non - overlapping packages? So, if I buy 3-$5 6-$10 and 5-$20, I would pay $15+$55+$90 = $160 ? __label__2 Could you please give a more detailed description of your problem. When did it start, etc ? __label__2 As Marcelo says in his answer, what you ' re doing doesn ' t (yet) make sense.

Auto - adjusting of the color ? __label__2 @hh - Fascinating topic, but "which energy sources would you use" isn ' t answerable in its current form. Can you please ask a specific question ? __label__2 A perfect hash is only possible in this case if you don ' t want to hash any arbitrary combination of 17 digits, but only a limited list of keys all known in advance. Is that what you have ? __label__2 Okay, how about this.. Give me five minutes. I ' ll list all the images you have uploaded, you tell me where they came from, okay ? __label__2 The answers below indicate that this is UB, but I ' m curious about what *actually happens*. Does it crash or continue harmlessly ? __label__2 I get the error message "sorry, not enough content to play this station". Can you explain a bit what your code do, and does this need an account on Lastfm or something else ?__label__2 When the breakpoint 'activates' is the `struct frame` in scope? Do you have more variables named `Frame`, possibly static to another translation unit or local to some function .. ?__label__2 Will there be any conflicts, i . e. could there be points `G` and `H` that are within `delta` of `A` and `F`?__label__2 I wonder where your family member got such an outlandish idea. Not a native English speaker, I guess ? __label__2 I noticed that you have a lot of empty or blanked sandboxes that you used before moving articles to mainspace.

By omission, is Hornoir saying that the delegate has authority over other aspects of the project ? __label__2 At the request of <url>, here <url>, I ' ve created a set of quality and importance Categories for Rail transport in Germany, here: <url> and <url> and I ' ve set up the links in Wikipedia 1 . 0 assessments. Could you tweak <url> so that it copies the WPTrains "class" parameter across into Rail transport in Germany and to allow the assignment of "importance" for Rail transport in Germany ? __label__2 what is the metrics? if there is no perfect solution, how do you evaluate which solution is better then the other ? __label__2 The SNL encyclopedia article says "M / S Palatia", while my book source says it probably was a steamship (with a note saying that their sources differ). Do you have any more details on this ship ? __label__2 As far as I can tell, the personal attacks against editors has indeed subsided. Are you indicating you are aware of recent incidents ? __label__2 You give us some setup, but you don ' t explain what the problem is.

If i ' m right and it does have something to do with being logged in can someone please explain to me WHY WHY WHY would that matter??__label__2 Im the same as Hectorian, i had a look on the talk page history and the archive, and i cant see any interaction. Any ideas ? __label__2 At least I am quite sure I need to keep my sourcecode available to anyone if I use the GPL library, and according to the discussions here http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 4577044 / complying - with - the - gpl - in - an - iphone - app - we cannot distribute any GPL application on the Apple App Store too.

Are you looking for something that doesn ' t error out when the index doesn ' t exist ? __label__2 It sounds like you ' re 90% of the way there already with the realisation that you should just normalise everything to consistent units. What specific issue are you still facing ? __label__2 I have stamped out numerous non - GB spellings in <url> per <url>.

As for Viluy, I see a theme with the Witches 5 ' s names and I don ' t see a reason that Viluy should deviate; maybe the stone is named for the deity ? __label__2 @stOle - Your solution needs more explanation as in how the two problems are the same. Are you able to reduce one problem to the other ? __label__2 In addition, I wonder what Encyclopedist is up to now - he claims that he has gained adminship under another account while simutaneously vandalizing using other socks. Should we attempt to seek out his other accounts and have them blocked and / or desysopped ? __label__2 Does it matter that it is a 2D array? Are two seats on left window (one behind another) closer than on the windows on opposite sides ? __label__2  * in some conditions i want this tag to be completely disabled*: What does this mean? What conditions ? __label__2 Also, in all the examples the first char in the pattern matches the first char in the string. I that a rule ? __label__2 Well, works for me anyway - http://paste . ubuntu . com / 509394/. Did apt give you any errors while installing the package postgresql - 8 . 4 ? __label__2 Yes, <url> already mentioned that <url>, and it seems that the concern was not addressed. Han Amos, could you explain your use of blocking templates in place of the blocking admin ? __label__2 You must be a Lisper. Am I right ? __label__2 How are you trying to tether? Are you using PDAnet ? __label__2 * If the person doesn ' t know what time it is, but glances at the state of the bits, they should be able to deduce that the current time is within a certain range. * The question you are posing is: What should be the on time / off time for each bit that would yield the min ( max ( deducible time range))?__label__2 I have advised past attendees of this discussion. Does the last weekend of October work for you ? __label__2 Yes the second for loop has no braces as it contains a single statement within it.

This is a nice theme for sci - fi discussion but did you honestly believe anyone could answer this with *physics*? :-)__label__2 I don ' t see any problem.

Could you post the details of how you have the SB600 configured ? __label__2 I ' m serious, I just don ' t want a mistake to happen to another person that happened to my friend.

Does that tell you anything ? __label__2 It looks like 80x86 assembly. Who else would name the registers as Intel did ? __label__2 I am stuck with the formatting of <url>, especially the ref tags. How can I make the different chapters of my main source book show up correctly ? __label__2 You said in Terrorism : Talk that a user can be blocked from a particular article. How could you block all the sockpuppets of that user ?__label__2 Thankyou for the message. Isn ' t it academic convention to specify which edition one has cited and give the page numbers therefrom ? __label__2 No way. Still don ' t believe I found this question on Stack Overflow ;) So the next time you apply the `Goto` function, will you do `Goto ( Io, \epsilon)` where `Io` is that first state ? __label__2 i ' ve been reading a bit on different VNC clients (programmes, im sorry for my bad english expressions :-P) and what i get is that i can have different computers showing the same on all screens, but then i think that when i move the mouse on the first computer i ' ll move it on other computers as well? or am i getting something wrong ? __label__2 Could you be more specific about where the air is coming from? Around frame of jambs? windows loose in jambs? Outside of pre - hung frame ? __label__2 I have a question. How do I move these pictures you talked about, to Wikimedia Commons ? __label__2 are you looking for an algorithm that is optimized for a single query?

What ' s the point listing results in various fields of physics that one consider "counter - intuitive" ?__label__2 What do you suggest we do with the ''citation needed''? Once we remove that, I would say it ' s pretty close to a GA. What do you think ? __label__2 Have a look at the changes. Do you think they will break anything ? __label__2 I ' m not sure I understand your question? What ' s the issue you ' re having??__label__2 Regrettably, I know little about <url>. Which dermatology - related articles have you seen me editing ? __label__2 I have no idea what you mean, please describe your question better. What exactly are you doing, what is returned *where* and what would you expect ? __label__2 I haven ' t seen the spec, but if your example is correct it appears they ' ve defined "25% tint" as a strict multiplication of the values. In fact that makes a certain amount of sense - how else would you define it ? __label__2 please provide an example illustrating your problem. Also how do you define power of algorithm ? __label__2 Needs some updating. Do you still work on it ? __label__2 What version of Exchange server is this? <= 2003 or > 2003 ? __label__2 Oh I know, but I think that ' s a ''problem''.

Can anyone confirm this ? __label__2 I find that "GIS for the masses" is an oxymoron, I end up calling it computer mapping or web mapping. Does your question include browser based mapping apps ? __label__2 I have added former cat members to <url>, but I ' m not sure whether <url>, <url> and <url> should go there. BTW, maybe <url> and <url> would be better placed in <url>, as "after Tolkien"?__label__2 Can you give an example of a recipe that didn ' t work out as you hoped ? __label__2 Hi WeHope. Another small issue at the DYK nom page, could you take a look ? __label__2 An AfD was started for that page before you speedy - nuked it. Could you close <url> please ? __label__2 I tried to fix your problem with <url>. Is that what you were looking for ? __label__2 may I suggest that you give different names (`\fooa`, `\foob` etc would be okay) to the different version of `\foo`, so that it ' s easier to refer to them? Including a name for "the second version of `\foo` with `\else \ relax` uncommented", please :-) Also, I ' m not sure I understand: do you expect the second version of `\foo` to give the same result as the first one ? __label__2 I ' m afraid I don ' t entirely understand what you mean. Is there some conflict with using user authorization and the GPL license ? __label__2 What is the submit method ? a regular submit or an ajax submit ?__label__2 So what do you think they want, anyway?

Is someone trying to sneak in their Amazon book store or something ? __label__2 This feels familiar. Homework ? __label__2 @mfg - I ' m not sure what the best way is to do this. You ' re planning to do a separate CW question or a post over at BF ? __label__2 I ' ve asked Jza84 if he could have a go at drawing a new plan, he ' s asking if we have any source material he could work from.

Could you tell me how you do them ? __label__2 Could you please show your setup . py file? Also why is your setup . py in C:\Python27 ? __label__2 Perhaps you could elaborate a little bit more on your built order. Are you gathering enough resources, what else are you doing, are you scouting to see what the others are doing ? __label__2 For all we know they could easily just be two random numbers stored in a database somewhere with no actual mapping. Why do you want this - you want to scrape all the extensions off the site mechanically ? __label__2 This is how Hotmail has been programmed to work. Why is using a folder other than `Deleted` not an option for you ? __label__2 Does your file names follow a pattern?

Or does it use only C standard library and POSIX API ? __label__2 Quick question.. when you define a custom command, is there a way for it to receive arguments? For example: `'/dosomething arg1 arg2'` ?__label__2 I noticed another editor putting in those wikidates. Why are they significant ? __label__2 The policy is tricky - I guess it comes down to whether or not you think the account is going to be disruptive, and whether it is appropriate to guess that ahead of time. On the other hand, looks like another overreaction to Kurt, in my opinion - what do you think ? __label__2 I added one. Does it look alright ? __label__2 So argument that "''Note: many Moldovans declared themselves as Romanians or Russians.''" is wrong because NO Moldovians declared themselves as russian ? __label__2 The navigation popups will not appear on certain pages in the Wikipedia namespace. Is this a bug ? __label__2 So it would seem that the ideas underpinning the law of conservation of mass existed at the time (if not previously), Lavoisier and others were formulating the principle, it did not become a verified "law" until the nineteenth century, which subsequently was qualified in the twentieth century.

Have you googled, "C# Custom Exception" yet, to see what you get ? __label__2 Force vector and displacement vector is a bit wonky and way above my head in mathematical theory but I wonu2019t disagree. Can you link the two to another article ? __label__2 It ' s not that I don ' t like to use `memoir` commands -- it ' s that I don ' t know what they are in the first place. =) Could you please extend your answer to include the code which produces the same result but uses only `memoir` commands ? __label__2 What are your compression options? Do you need lossless compression when you split the image up into tiles ? __label__2 how are they going to be used / accessed? through a bespoke app or what ? __label__2 More a bot to flag articles where persondata and defaultsort disagree, so that humans can check which is correct.

Is that not the correct Template to use in that case ? __label__2 Why would they be apart *without* optimization? I would imagine that the optimization is that space is allocated for both in advance ? __label__2 In fact, what I ' d like to propose here is that we take a bit more control, establish some stricter edit warring restrictions, unprotect the page, slap up an edit notice, and enforce them with blocks so that people can get back to writing the article.

So is SIFT a replacement for NCC or SAD ? __label__2 Rklawton, I apologize for persisting, but criterion 8 of <url> says that a band must be the "most prominent of the LOCAL scene of a city" to be notable enough to justify a page, and Finish Ticket is demonstrably the most prominent band of the local San Francisco scene. Why is that not sufficient ? __label__2 Seems like `HfJsonValue` is already an object. why treat it as JSON and convert it to object ? __label__2 @JavadocMD you are correct, I must have missed that.

Can the former be blocked for quacking despite a lack of recent activity ? __label__2 In what way are they better? I ' m asking because I have the LPCXpresso board and the tools seem to work well so I ' m wondering how the other tools are better ? __label__2 Somewhat related, shouldn ' t <url>, be renamed to <url>?

Can user add anybody as his friend, or maybe people from his groups are his friends ? __label__2 @Eric - Sure, it mitigates it to an extent, but why start with something insecure when it ' s just as easy to use something more secure (i . e. same code, just swap out algorithm name)?__label__2 Do you get any error message? Does your success message show up ? __label__2 This isn ' t that hard to do, but it will depend on how you set up the cell. Can you show us the code where you create the cell, labels and buttons ? __label__2 It doesn ' t look like you have any image loaded at the time you are calling this. Do you know how to wait for the image to load to ask for height and width ? __label__2 Please expand on what you ' re trying to ask. Point out the differences of what ? __label__2 I believe I may have addressed (at least a substantial portion of) your comments.

What source is it from ? __label__2 Is this question about the algorithm itself (ie. you are positively sure that your implementation is error - free, but you don ' t understand why the algorithm outputs this particular result), or about your implementation (which you suspect is erratic and therefore gives wrong results)?__label__2 is extending pdo a bad thing? I had an independent mysqli class before but I was told better off extending mysqli so I thought it must be the same as pdo??__label__2 Hi, I added to the <url> page, and I want to start separate articles about Heer and Ranjha themselves. The <url> page however points to something else now - how do I bring in a disambiguation page for HEER ? __label__2 Is this a homework problem? Whats the dataset from ? __label__2 Hi again - I notice that the Chew Valley template gives Stanton Drew as an SSI - but I can ' t find it listed at EN ' s site.

Length of List 1 or List 2 or list1+list2 ? __label__2 Can you dial back the toque like you can with an electric screwdriver ? __label__2 hmm..odd. can you give us the source you ' re searching ? __label__2 Could you elaborate a bit on "I ' ve tried using koconverter, a batch converter for KOffice documents included in KDE libs, but neither the one from KOffice 1 . 6 . x nor the one from 2 . 2 . x works." Do they not support the old format or are you running into some other error ? __label__2 Is it a difference between users? Have you configured iTextSharp correctly on the server ? __label__2 More than likely it ' s an IP block. Any way of checking the IP at your end ? __label__2 @Christoffer Hammarstrm: http://ww . stat . lsa . umich . edu/~kshedden / Courses / Stat545 / Notes / AffxFileFormats / cel . html -- though in there specs I do not see the data I ' m seeing in the file; that being the barcode.

Does that mean that the average of what each player gets is the minimal possible distance from the max a player got and min a player got ? __label__2 I get the regular edit page with the instructions and everything when I click on it. Did you replace SOCKMASTER with the actual name of the sockmaster (the account controlling all the sock puppets) in the box ? __label__2 This Latvian Scout image has Zemgale in the name, but the Latvian name is 600 miles away buried in storage. Would it be enough to call it the Zemgale Regional SO ? __label__2 The challenge has been put aside (for some time), but not forgotten! Do we still want to do this ? __label__2 I am a fairly new admin. When is it appropriate to use such a block as you did with a user I ' d blocked ? __label__2 What is `:first - child` applying to in what you have written? What is it meant to apply to ? __label__2 Please mention the version of ubuntu you are using, as well the catalyst ( fglrx) driver version. Do you experience tearing or any other distortion ? __label__2 Looking over your pastebin code, actually, this seems like a problem: `UnHit = [CoordList [ 0]]`. Should the `0` be a `:`?__label__2 Ok the table has few nvarchar columns , couple float columns ,a ntext column I observerd that the error is caused when I am filtering for the columns but couldnt find which column or row ? __label__2 @user unknown, please edit that into your answer - I don ' t want any users to read or write unlike the other answer. And will this permission setting affect live sessions ? __label__2 It ' s very difficult to understand your problem if you don ' t provide the related code (HTML and maybe CSS in this case). Can you be more specific ? __label__2 Well I came to the same conclusion as Rpyle731. Perhaps a trip to the talk page is in order ? __label__2 I ' d also add a question about how secure this erase procedure is.. (i . e. is the data still stored on the phone ' s hard drive or not?)__label__2 Sorry for the confusion, I just updated the question to specify a total of 60 characters or less, but it ' s a great code snippet. Question, should you be using block comments in there ? __label__2 __In a Linux kernel context, the only lock with a spin implementation has a mutex interface.__ I dint understand this line. Could you please expand on it ? __label__2 How do you want to handle this? - <person> (which will take about a week), or should one of us just create the new category and transfer the articles, then you can <person> the old one ? __label__2 Yes, nearly every church category seems messed up, going either up or down. It seems a major task to do the whole lot - would it make sense simply to move the Catholics (say) out of the primate tree (by an edit) or is this bypassing the cfd process in some sneaky fashion ? __label__2 You haven ' t specified the filename in the example. Could that be it ? __label__2 @peterjwest if that is a room and you use rectangles for collision detection you ' ll get a lot of false positives. Or am I missing something ? __label__2 It looks like it was carved out of both Ochamchira and Gali but I ' m not sure whether that ' s actually the case. Do you ? __label__2 No, it is for a student project (matrix calculation with multiple processes), but for this step I have to use mmap. Is there another way to share the variable between all my processes ?__label__2 When someone tags articles using non - existent criteria, there ' s no way the articles should be deleted. The deleting admin has restored Reviewmageddon now, so it seems it ' s sorted out ? __label__2 Is there a reason your sample output for A1 doesn ' t contain C# and Perl? Aren ' t those included based on "2) items only in a1 and not in a2"?__label__2 I think I may have found a solution on the Immaculate Conception article. The deadline is October 11th ? __label__2 Shall try and dig an example up for you tomorrow. But would you consider adding a `XmlReader` style class to the library in the future ? __label__2 What is your purpose? To test how the UI looks or is it functional testing ? __label__2 no problem. ic an hit it up through preferences seciton, right ? __label__2 I am using 6 . 20 and it uses Page Title | Site title and I have not changed anything. Have you check Site information ? __label__2 In this case, posting the code that causes the error, and just the exception _without_ the full trace would probably be more helpful. The error message says that you ' re passing a `nil` argument to `-[NSURL initFileURLWithPath:]`; have you looked into that ? __label__2 I ' ve tried a setter method as well. The var wasn ' t getting the value until after the app was closed and reopen for some reason ? __label__2 Are you using Visual Studio? If so, what version ? __label__2 Sorry, but the Find feature tells me that "Heavydata" isn ' t anywhere on the ANI page. Did you mean to send me somewhere else ? __label__2 Yes, ''kaen chokugeki hou'' is exactly right. Do you have that same NTSC Hong Kong DVD that I do ? __label__2 I don ' t have enough reputation. Can someone fix the spelling in the title ? __label__2 Queens have already been talked about in this question: http://gaming . stackexchange . com / questions / 5642 / spawn - larva - with - no - mouse - clicks Perhaps a similar approach works for chrono boost ? __label__2 Can you reveal what are you trying to acomplish? Have you considered a database and / or full text indexing for your needs ? __label__2 If you ' ve got a NASM resource, it should be relatively straight forward to convert it to MASM. Why not post a link to what you ' re looking at ? __label__2 The block has indeed expired. What message are you getting when you try to edit ? __label__2 Was <url> by the user correct? It is supposed to be a redirect, is it not ? __label__2 This question is a forum - style post, asking for multiple answers. Perhaps ask for the method that does the best job, or requires the least effort ? __label__2 @Stefan ubuntu se should merge with superuser. have you seen the questions tehre ? __label__2 Wait, I answered too quickly. Do you mean, you want the string **`2009 - 08 - 14 00 : 37 : 02`** or the number of seconds since the epoch ? __label__2 Last guess then - are you sure it is multi - threaded? Do you get any output just using "bt"?__label__2 Maybe I ' m confused.. isn ' t POD (perlpod) extra formatting? Or can it work without adding *anything* to the existing code ? __label__2 You can ' t just say 'this is the unit that counters everything' in Starcraft. What *exactly* are you trying to counter from terran ? __label__2 You tagged this as bayesian and machine - learning. What kind of data analysis are you interested in ? __label__2 @lasseespeholt: I see. If I may ask, what else do you need ? __label__2 Is it important to you to strip all the way down to a bare frame? Or is overhauling one system at a time OK ? __label__2 GDB is not natively able to jump over frames w / o debug info? I ' m quite surprised, it shouldn ' t be a problem.. what ' s the ouput of `bt` ?__label__2 When you say "good", do you mean an efficient one? Why do you require it to be non - greedy ? __label__2 The body of the question is fine, but the title is a bit confusing. Perhaps the title could be, "Which states allow bicyclists to legally treat stop signs as yields?"__label__2 I noticed that you twice placed a request for citation on the <url> page,<url> <url>, but it was silently removed by <url> <url>. I ' ve removed the sentence altogether; do you think any other action should be taken at this point ? __label__2 Hi. Was the promo for "Packing Heat" a TV one, or an online one that I can cite ? __label__2 Hi! How u find out my article:)?__label__2 Hi JP. Can you tell me what a CPC value is please ? __label__2 It is not possible to update primary key columns in a relational database. Maybe you can use a surrogate key ? __label__2 Are you running the command as a super user? (sudo python setup . py install)?__label__2 Glad to see someone else involved. I ' ve suggested an RfC, what do you think ? __label__2 Does that mean all the realiable sources are incorrect too? Was the e - mail from a reliable source ? __label__2 Actually using (overridable) setters is more risky than accessing a private field. What if someone subclasses your class and redefines the setter ? __label__2  " without cycles".. "i need to find out the minimum numbers of cycles"? You mean chains, right ? __label__2 If I have been correctly informed, some languages support the construct `break N` where `N` is the number of nested loops to break out from. Am I right ? __label__2  ' Is it worth..' is very subjective. Can you rephrase your question in a more objective manner ?__label__2 And can you point me to a statement of that company where they say that they release their images into the <url>? Or can you provide proof that their copyright has expired ? __label__2 Also, I don ' t understand the question. What are you trying to do with that array ? __label__2 Another MySQL database, or another database type? Do you still want access to the regular WordPress database, or are you moving the site from one DB to another ? __label__2 Whats a YML? Can you show sample YML file ? __label__2 Is street address only identifier? How about email ID / cookies / IP based detection ? __label__2 Can you explain why {{1 , 2},{3 , 4}} is not "interesting"? What is the relabeling that gives the same section ? __label__2 You would be changing the semantics of the underlying language if you could do that - not usually a good idea. Maybe you ' d be happier with a completely different programming language that has semantics for int / float expressions which are more to your taste ?__label__2 ..is it making any noises, e . g. 'clunks', as part of that extra noise ? __label__2 See: <url>. If I remember correctly, you said you planned on cleaning up after the bot tagged the images; is that still the case ? __label__2 Is there any way to request a change to the citation template? For example, a <code>style=mla</code> parameter to render the values in MLA style ? __label__2 That works better. Do you reckon it may even be worth listing the case in the introductory paragraph ? __label__2 As his son (the mayor) was also an MP, this doesn ' t seem an ideal disambiguation, though I ' m not sure what would be better here! Perhaps we need to resort to using dates ? __label__2 I have created a Neutral section for those who agree with the premise but not the method, or some other aspect, which may be altered following talkpage discussion. Perhaps you would wish to review your !vote under the changed circumstances ? __label__2 the code would be to big to post here on SO. so how would I use classes with my Jquery code ? __label__2 What do you mean by usernames of a process? Do you want to know the user that created each process ? __label__2 Hi Dan. Is the page <url> still needed / useful ? __label__2 So, what does your ActionListener - Method? Does it simply call `updateTable()`, but does nothing with the result ? __label__2 Works Ok for me - in fact you don ' t even need the 's' variable. What is it about that which doesn ' t work ? __label__2 What do you mean by "view"? Do you mean how can you tell if the mouse is over the table view or if it ' s over a row / column / cell in the table view ? __label__2 I think the key of your problem is "In some circumstances" meaning. In other words, can you give the exact steps that reproduce the problem ? __label__2 I don ' t understand. Isn ' t bounding box just a box containing all of your rectangles ? __label__2 PicPush does seem like a perfect solution, I just haven ' t bothered with it because of the cost. Is there any reason you weren ' t happy with it Gary ? __label__2 I ' m not really sure what your asking here. Could you clarify what you ' re having trouble with ? __label__2 Looks like Jappalang added <url> to the hitlist. Did you find any blank maps of Africa ? __label__2 Replied on my talk page. Maybe move the conversation somewhere else if specific issues need further discussion ? __label__2 How is your triangle represented? 3 pairs of `(x , y)` coordinates ? __label__2 Apologies for this being on your page, but then you are an admin. Is it normal for 6 articles to have cut - and - paste identical substantial content on Wikipedia ? __label__2 I was really unsure on what to do with <url> so I made it into a dab. That ok ? __label__2 I ' m sorry if I wasn ' t clear, I ' m asking why it isn ' t something you can choose to do every time? What is the reason you can ' t do that ? __label__2 What version? 6 or 7 ? __label__2 I ' m really seeing no evidence that this image is free. Are you able to shed any light on the issue ? __label__2 Not sure what you mean by _"preserve"_ the sort parameter. Do you mean *"How do I parse a URL such that it generates a list of posts on a category page using the desired sort order?"*__label__2 Like the data dumps? Or does it need to be current ? __label__2 Hi, I see from your post at the reference desk, which I saw from your post at <url>, about times for locating wreckage (by the way, I posted a list of biggies I could find record of that have never been found) that you have read the above article. I have recently started converting some stuff ther that was still in present tense to past tense, in preparation for a push towards the article becomming our first air disaster FA (not counting ''<url>'', of course) and was wondering: as someone who knew nothing about the crash before, and has just read the article, do you think it ' s possible ? __label__2 The one place where none of these arguments work is in sentences like these: "Everyone got a gift that __ loved." Now, fill in the blank (please?)?__label__2 <url> finally got created, but I ' m wondering whether it should be merged with <url>. Can it be expanded ? __label__2 Could you add a bit more context please? e . g. what R function and package are you using ? __label__2 You ' re not giving a whole lot of useful information. WHAT type of keyboard, i . e., brand, layout, and what language ? __label__2 The answers to the referenced question include two completely different ways of using Robot. Which did you profile ? __label__2 Whatever works. I trust that you ' ll do what ya gotta do, right ? __label__2 What exactly does connected mean? If two dots are both on and are adjacent is that one connection ? __label__2 at the end of the <nowiki><head> </head></nowiki>. Could that be fixed again, please ? __label__2 I would never do that without consulting the blocking admin first (and probably I wouldn ' t either way). What do you say ? __label__2 Can you define what you mean by best? Best as in the most secure regardless of cost or something that has the best of everything, small, lightweight and good value for money ? __label__2 I don ' t know how generic you need this, but do you need to be wary of more than one where clause, e . g. in a subquery ? __label__2 Are you trying to minimize the material cost, or just beat the commercial version ' s price? How much do the commercial ones cost, roughly ? __label__2 When I was with Slackware, I used to type `startx` after logging in, so I think that was me who start the X server (and not root). Is that what you are asking for ? __label__2 @Mark C This question could hardly have been answered accurately in a high school text. Perhaps it asked about two adjoining nodes ? __label__2 I suppose there could be several valid solutions? If that is the case, are you looking for some optimal solution in some sense ? __label__2 Was the location called Amen Corner before he bought the shop there ? If not, perhaps the location is named after the shop rather than vice versa ?__label__2 I was told by a wikipedian that these following three sources are unreliable <url>. Is that true ? __label__2 how is your data formatted for insertion i . e. what structure are keys and $val stored in ? __label__2 What ' s the declaration for v1 and v2? Are they of the correct type for %f ? __label__2 I ' m sorry, but there is no discussion on the talk page that indicates that there was a debate about renaming, so the keep vote stands, I ' m afraid. There were nine votes to keep, and only one to merge, so I don ' t understand how a single vote trumps nine others ? __label__2 Hi, it looks as if SVG images in taxoboxes are not counted when producing the list of tree of life articles without images. Is that intended ?__label__2 I ' m somewhat puzzled by your recent edits on the Harper page, which have left two different sets of footnotes. Could you please explain your rationale for the change ? __label__2 Hey, I see you ' ve been contributing! Time to lose the "leaving Wikipedia" box ? __label__2 I can ' t reproduce this. can you post a link to the image with this behavior ? __label__2 I ' m not sure what this question is asking. Perhaps more examples would be helpful ? __label__2 Also - for some reason images on image pages now appear in full size when I view them, rather than more convienient viewing sizes. Do you know how I can fix this ? __label__2 @Noldorin: this [wikipedia page](http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Ansatz) will disagree with you. Indeed when reading mathematical and physical literature (both books and papers) I encounter this word far more often than I would like :-) What ' s the proper English term, by the way ? __label__2 @Sukumar What do you mean by "size of my page"? Could you please give me an example of "passing the values directly to javacsript"?__label__2 why was I down voted for this? Is it not a valid question ? __label__2 Is as usual being overrun with pointless blather. Would you like to set up a subpage to discuss sources ? __label__2 Sorry, reading a bit about alpha testing - it seems to come at the end of the pipeline, which introduces aliasing problems: http://blogs . msdn . com / b / shawnhar / archive / 2011 / 05 / 06 / antialiasing - alpha - cutouts . aspx. As a final question, do you happen to know how to do alpha testing in XNA 4 . 0 ? __label__2 Shell scripting also has language syntax and dialects. Are you using bash perhaps ? __label__2 it might depend on the actual definition of BYTE. Maybe `TRUE` and `FALSE` are already defined, so your `#ifdef`-ed code is actually never executed ? __label__2 What would be needed is for a human to check the list, do various filters, and then suggest values for the missing data. What is the best format to return the data in, having in mind the idea to get a bot to add the data ? __label__2 How about `Class<? super T> type`?__label__2 I think I have fixed this, but I am not sure. Where do I stand with use of publicity photographs, created with the express intention of promoting someone or thing ? __label__2 what are the results of your efforts? What is happening instead of what you want to happen ? __label__2 exactly! Any ideas ? __label__2  " What ' s the best" is impossible to answer, as it implies subjectivity rather than objectivity. You ' d be best asking (in the future) the question as "Given my situation (x), what ' s the recommended (y)?"__label__2 Are you an admin? Do you want to be one ? __label__2 I suspect you ' re not going to have much luck getting that question answered here. (On the other hand, who knows what wisdom is lurking amongst the populace?)__label__2 @Guillermo How do you get the lines ? Just in one time by **readlines()** or iterating on the file ?__label__2 If you unregister that option then any dependancies core code has on that option will fail (though it may not cause a problem - i ' m just hesitant to say there would be no side effects). The problem is that you ' re probably calling that function before the file that declares the function has been included, where are you placing the code ? __label__2 I will endeavour to be (cant think of antonyms) non - combative and kind. Will you give me a particular example of what I wrote and what I should have written ? __label__2 not a direct answer to your question. but shouldn ' t you be opening exclusive ? __label__2 Quick question. In your opinion would the Dromore by election meet notability ? __label__2 Are you running Visual Studio with elevation, i . e. as Administrator ? __label__2 Thanks ! ..wouldn ' t you know my first award would be for being a smart ass ?__label__2 Is it timing out, or getting a 500 error? Have you enabled all error reporting in your php . ini as well ? __label__2 Hello. Regarding <url>, could you tell me what supports this being a free image ? __label__2 No idea I never visit the page myself :-( . As it ' s obvious they are socks I figured why wait ? __label__2 Are you interested in whether the distributions are of a different form (e . g., normal, poisson, etc.) or whether parameters are different (e . g., mean or sd of a normal distribution) or both ? __label__2 Normally I ' d welcome <person>, but in this case I think you are a better editor to do that as I ' m he - 0! Would you do the honours please ? __label__2 Are the preferences of people always constant or are they somehow weighted, ie. some poeple ' s preferences count more than others'?__label__2 About being part of a "collective" author on Wikipedia - about having your writing "edited mercilessly" by others - that sort of thing. I ' m "interviewing" a bunch of people over email - can I add you to my list ? __label__2 It appears that <url> is editing Mike Patton - related articles again, this time <url>. I ' m wondering if you think further blocks would be in order, or semi - protection for those articles ? __label__2 Hi Carnildo, I ' ve just noticed the <url> stopped working last week. Could you advise whether it ' s going to be restarted, or whether I should manually remove red links from articles for the last week ? __label__2 The background image doesn ' t duplicate for me, [here ' s a demo](http://jsfiddle . net / Town / L7fDp/). Is it possible you ' ve got something else overriding the `background` definition ? __label__2 Look at <person> for an even stronger example and the link <code><nowiki><url></nowiki></code> <url>. Without the redlink, how would the new article creator be guided to create under <url> rather than <url> ?__label__2 It ' s a snippet, but mostly of where the action is. Suggestion to fix ? __label__2 Did make me smile..a dreamtime legend of a tiger in WA of all places. Seems a long way to walk, even when there was a land bridge ?__label__2 Question seems a little bit too open ended. Are you talking about working with databases as a module developer (CRUD) or just for general content queries (in which case I would suggest Views) or something else completely ? __label__2 What do you mean by 'variable'? More specifically, are you including fields and properties, or are you referring specifically to method - local variables ? __label__2 I ' m the uploader of the hubble pictures. What do I put for the author, description, and stuff ? __label__2 How big is an integer? Is this a 10G file that contains integers stored as text, or in binary format ? __label__2 Bounty passed, I would have doubled it even, but now as you answer your own question and you already have plenty of points and I only can offer one bounty at a time I might consider to put my next bounty on another question. Okay with that ? __label__2  " Slightly differently" is completely fine to me. What is wrong with it ? __label__2 Thanks for the tips. But what was that something I heard somewhere about you leaving after getting Final Fantasy VII to FA, or something ? __label__2 Why do the width and height in the HTML differ from those in the CSS? Are you sure the shadow isn ' t just off - screen or something ? __label__2 The thing that amazes me about Margenat is that he died so young, 24 years old, with so much talent and so much to offer. Can you imagine all that he would have given the world if he lived to a ripe old age ? __label__2 Sorry, I will check into this next week. Have you preserved UTF - 8 (see comments on top of the wikEd code)?__label__2 Sorry about that. I guess instructions are there for a reason, right ? __label__2 I was about to ask the same question on <url>. Did you ever find out ? __label__2 3d is often hard to explain in text. Can you give us a sketch ? __label__2 I ' m a bit busy IRL, but I ' ve got a bit of time. What ' s up ? __label__2 Sorry to bother you again, but you changed your comment to "keep" ? I don ' t really understand, i thought you agreed with me..?__label__2 What a great Marine and patriot. Is he in the L " ist of historically famous Marines"?__label__2 two questions 1) wich database are you using? 2) are you using BDE ? __label__2 @Michael, now think of the relationships between Cows and Herds, and between Cows and Cartoons. Are there any many - to - many relationships there ? __label__2 I don ' t see "parent" at all. Maybe it exists in your templates ? __label__2 Because I haven ' t seen it; I ' m not even sure from the discussion whether it ' s on or off Wikipedia. Can you supply a link or a reference ? __label__2 Is this homework? What topics are you studying in class at the moment ? __label__2 Can you give me a general description of <url>? Does it mention anything about making movie ? __label__2 Do you know how far apart the trusses are? How thick the plywood sheeting is ? __label__2 I see your nomination of Template : GR today, and I ' d ask you to look at my proposal. If you like it, would you be willing to find someone with the technical knowhow to try it out ? __label__2 Consider adding a picture. Could it be a drain for a sump pump, perhaps in your basement ? __label__2 Could you, please, point us to a correct calculation? .. in "as if" case ? __label__2 A word changed or omitted here and there is normal (I notice this because I ' m deaf as a post and find myself turning on the captions constantly when I watch DVDs), but the discrepancies are quite pervasive, so much as to change the tone, if note the content, of the dialogue, which definitely is not normal. Do you think I need to expand my edit to make that point ? __label__2 Thanks for your additional categorizing. :) I guess I could just look at your contributions, but before catting, what "work" were you doing previously ? __label__2 What is the output of the console? When you build on the phone ? __label__2 I find it done both ways on the web. If some convention requires capitalizing it even though it ' s not anything like a proper noun, I think that should get explained in the article, otherwise reasonable people will wonder who it ' s named after: someone named Saros, but what ' s his first name and where ' s the Wikipedia article about him ? __label__2 Suresh is saying that you don ' t have to put "community wiki" on this question, if you rephrase the question to be something other than a big list, and were more specific about what you ' re looking for. Also, is it really a "soft question"?__label__2 Question what is the average of (0, 180)? 90 or 270 ? __label__2 It ' s 2011. By the time they grow up (20 years from now), which career path would be bereft of some form of programming ? __label__2 Do you _really_ want python to do the conversion? What are the disadvantages, in your view, of simply calling `pdflatex` as an external command ? __label__2 Pipes are IPC tools. Where ' s your other process ? __label__2 What is the representation of the graph you have? Is the graph oriented ? __label__2 @Mana I ' m all for having the front page covered with DF :), but where in the world do you get the idea it ' s PC only? Or are you including all the operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac) under PC ? __label__2 Regarding "within the church", the problem is on one end that purring that prepositional at the beginning feels very clunky, but that other formulations almost all result in something like "at .. at", which is no better. I can ' t see a way to just juggle the sentence, so a different structure seems to be necessary; maybe a formulation with a verb like "contains" or "include" instead would work better ? __label__2 on a separate point, several of the alternative names you mention (eg fan - tailed snipe) I have never heard in the UK or elsewhere in 20 years of birding. Perhaps you could clarify when you add them whether they are former obsolete names, or, if they are still current, where they are used ? __label__2 Hi. Are you still a "maybe" for the meetup ? __label__2  " graphical graph"? Or "graphical models"?__label__2 If a user asks for the deleted text of an article, I do restore the text they request to a page in their userspace (unless, of course, the text is something that should ''stay'' deleted). Do you want the text so you can improve the article in a userspace - subpage of yours and then move it back to an article when you ' re finished ? __label__2 What is the "number of missionaries or cannibals"? Is it the overall number of people `(+ missionaries cannibals)`, the maximum `(max missionaries cannibals)`, or what ? __label__2 What you want to read from the URL? can you please explain ?__label__2 is this running through Apache / mod - php? And if you don ' t have SSH access, what are you using to upload to this host ? __label__2 This is a bit off topic for Home Improvement. Have you tried contacting the company ' s customer support ? __label__2 Sorry, I see what happened now. In fact that ' s even stranger, how did I manage to make a multi - hour edit without getting hit during the vandal ' s attack ? __label__2 Where does it crash? Do you have a backtrace ? __label__2 I am not sure that your removal of the "Education" category is defensible, in light of the central role that pederasty played in the educational systems of the Greeks and the Japanese (and its mentions in the context of Islamic pedagogy). Can you comment ? __label__2 Interesting. Can you provide a link or two, so we can at least guess what those people ' s native language is ? __label__2 If I am allowed to squeak in, maybe there should be some discussion at <url> where the editors would express their opinions on the matter, with the dates staying for the time as they were before this started, that is, BC / AD. No ? __label__2 I ' m very sorry Rarst, I still don ' t fully understand. Can you please share an example ? __label__2 I am very concerned with T2. Do you have any ideas on how to stop it from being implimented ? __label__2 Since everyone else seems to be passing the buck here about finding the discussion, as per the argument on the above page ' s talk page, there is (and I know it existed at one time at least) a discussion, somewhere, about who to include and exclude from this page. User Rjanag points us to you as knowing the location of the discussion, so do you know where it is ? __label__2 Is this question about building a notification system for a 3rd party site, or one that you own? Do you have access to the internals of the site itself ? __label__2  " moving" map? Do you mean "mobile" map application ? __label__2 What do you mean by 'access'? Do you want to just read or also be able to write to the cell ? __label__2 I can ' t help wondering how you installed XP. Did it come bundled ? __label__2 Good, I ' m confused with the special terminology. Could you please simplify the terminology (or even better remove it)?__label__2 Just to clarify, you want to do non - bidirectional data transfer because the server will not ack. But you also want the server to push out data to these clients ? __label__2 Did you get any result? Are you sure that the numbers are not separated by an other whitespace character, like a tab ? __label__2 I am starting this now. As Dexter is an official history, we should be beyond reproach in redrawing it would you say ? __label__2 The expression you ' ve written, $M _ m/\sqrt{ <\psi|M _ m^+ M _ m|\psi> }$, is not a state at all. I guess you meant to add a $|\psi>$ after that ? __label__2 Did some of your formatting get eaten? Did you mean to say "I have a &lt ; form & gt; with several.." ?__label__2 Well then, if that ' s figured out, everything is ok with me. When do we start ? __label__2 @SamL: What is your current level of education? Do you enjoy maths even abstracting from physics ? __label__2 How big are the sets? Can you read all of them once from the disk and then keep them in memory ? __label__2 @FumbleFingers: Can you please make some explaining comments on your diagram? Where does the data come from ? __label__2 @FrustratedWithFormsDesigner: if it depends on the function, then the answer to the question is "no". At least, I interpret the question to mean, "is it true that for any two functions f, g, either f is O ( g) or f is Big - Omega ( g)?"__label__2 I clean up the <url> article a bit. What do you think ? __label__2 This seems to have become a standard put - down of yours<url>, but can you translate ''Go maith leith scxe9al'' <url> for me? Or did you mean ''Gabh mo leithscxe9al''?__label__2 Done, I think. How does that look ? __label__2 You did a WPMILHIST assessment on this page a while ago; one of your comments was that the "battle honours" section was difficult to read, but weren ' t sure what to do about it. I ' ve changed it to make it ( I think) more accessible; what do you think ? __label__2 I ' m not entirely sure what the question here is. Are you asking about specific forms of matrices, or the general case (in which case a simple counting argument seems to work)?__label__2 That function doesn ' t compute the slope, which is why you ' re having the problem you are.. Do you specifically need the slope, or is the upness or downness enough? Or do you actually want the ratio, which is what you ' re getting from your equation ? __label__2 That is actually quite a fair percentage, less than sixty six point six percent approval and the tool is not continued. What percentage of support do think is needed ? __label__2 @RoBYCoNTe: I tried to uncheck "ASP . NET" in the "Debuggers" section but it didn ' t change the behavior. What else should I check ? __label__2 Article names can indeed be changed. What would you suggest as a replacement name for "<url>", since that ' s the trait for which he is notable and the trait which distinguishes him from at least three other Malcolm Rosses ? __label__2 I saw that you gave this user two warnings within 1 minute. Is it possible that this user made the second bad edit, whatever it was, before seeing the first warning ? __label__2 Joe is right. Maybe we could merge the two questions / answers ? __label__2 *@Scott B* I mean why did you support a file on disk rather than an place in the admin? For multiple, have you considering created a "Sales Letter" custom post type ? __label__2 What is a "pair" - can you give an example? I . e. is { 3, -3 } a pair, or is { 3, 3 } a pair ? __label__2 If you think that ' s appropriate, I have no objection. Perhaps hold off a couple more days to see if it persists ? __label__2 Solo, you really need to compare effective top tube length to truly understand the comparison. Make sense ? __label__2 I remember your commenting on this about seven years ago. What ' s your view today ? __label__2 If that ' s really your code.. looks like you ' re going to end up with a ton of HTML UL elements with the same ID of 'day'. Does your real code actually output one UL with multiple LI children ? __label__2 @sky - Awesome! Where did you get that nice grid from ? __label__2 How are you measuring variation between paths? Via weights assigned to the edges or by the number of edges two paths have in common, or neither ? __label__2 The two summing nodes shouldn ' t affect each other. Can you draw the circuit ? __label__2 The exit is superfluous, it ' s called in drupal _ goto. Have you double checked the output of content _ profile _ load (with dpm for example) and multistep _ registration _ is _ complete to make sure that they are returning what you expect to see ? __label__2 Could you be more specific about exactly what kinds of terrible the roads are? Rough, nearly gravel, lots of glass, lots of thorns ? __label__2 It ' s not so clear here. You want to know how to use gcc to compile C program ? __label__2 Thanks. This circuit I ' m tapping into already has a GFCI receptacle on it. So I ' m OK, right ? __label__2 How do I "inform a Wikiproject"? I would have liked to do so in several articles, but is this not <url>?__label__2 As for the Norwoods, both South Norwood and Upper Norwood are in Croydon, but West Norwood belongs to the LB of Lambeth. Does that help ? __label__2 It ' s a possibility, but still leaves the problem that the terms are US Army jargon (at least, I don ' t recall hearing them anywhere else!). Maybe a transwiki to Wiktionary would be better ? __label__2 Is it native delphi or .NET? What do you mean by unix window ? __label__2 And how are you planning on handling this on the client? Phones today dont have encrypted SMS builtin, which means you ' d build a custom app.. and if you ' re doing that, why bother with SMS ? __label__2 I personally haven ' t really ran in to any fascists here, but I very much doubt that anyone would object to redirects. Could you tell me the location of the list ? __label__2 This one seems useful. Should we not turn those redlinks blue ? __label__2 An interesting observation: when doing a TimeMachine backup to a network drive TimeMachine will automatically mount, backup and then unmount the remote TimeMachine share on the network drive. I wonder if you could exploit that to achieve what you want ? __label__2 I have, see comment in original thread. Maybe there ' s a configuration option for it, or some way to set up a "dummy target" for nose ? __label__2 is `"puzzle game using","group of words"` a legal solution? or does it have to be 1 or 2 words per partition ? __label__2 Does `module _ x` instantiate the class in its module body? Or later, inside a function or such ? __label__2 i would recommend to have a look at some data structure book. How about Tannenbaum ?__label__2 Can you help patroling <url> page??__label__2 Hi, I see that you agree that User : Dr Joe ' s edits are suspicious.. his latest edit totally clinches it though, as he went to the article <url> and reverted my changes on it, exactly like Beckjord did one or twice in the past out of nowhere, and then made edit comments on his talk page and talk : Bigfoot about how "my" mythology article sucks and needs to be opposed. I was wondering if you could go undo his edit for me there ? __label__2 This question might have different solutions depending on your Country. Could you please specify it ? __label__2 Subsonic caches mp3 ' s to the memory card. So in this case, why would you want to do this ? __label__2 This suggests a driver problem in the newer kernel. Are you using wireless to connect to the internet ? __label__2 Are you asking how to persist the data (Access, Excel, Flat file) or how to query the data efficiently? Are you going to build this DataTable every time your application runs or do you need to persist it somewhere ? __label__2 Can you paste in your code? Or maybe try to find a small reproducible test case that you can paste here ? __label__2 can you rephrase the question? Don ' t know why division is needed.. is it to find the cumulative product ? __label__2 Puzzling then that neither of them rushed to rectify my changes as they so normally do. Perhaps they couldn ' t for some reason ? __label__2 the problem I have is with founding out what the base case and the inductive step are. the base case is n = 3, with the array being: operand operand operator, how do I prove that the program above evaluates it correctly ? __label__2 is this homework? how will this temp db be used ? __label__2 I don ' t see the vandalism. Could you show me where it is ? __label__2 You need to be more specific on the clustering. If p1 - p2 < d, and p2 - p3 < d, but p1 - p3 > d, do you still cluster p1 , p2 , p3 together ? __label__2 probably is recessed lighting. is this the style of lighting you are referring to http://ww . google . com / images ? q=recessed % 20lighting & safe=on & um=1 & ie=UTF - 8 & source=og & sa=N & hl=en & tab=wi & biw=1408 & bih=800 ?__label__2 What exactly do you want to do? Display list of images or something else ? __label__2 What does the model ' s source look like? What happens if you `Ad . reset _ column _ information` before `Ad . create`?__label__2 How about storage? O ( n)?__label__2 What is it that you ' re trying to do? Are you more concerned with whether or not the file exists or whether the file is empty ? __label__2 This seems a bit off topic to me. Perhaps more suitable for webmasters ? __label__2 Wordpress is just an application framework, it ' s not a domain framework so its architecture must be rather rudimentary. What would prevent to integrate the wp skeletton inside a domain mvc framework for example ?__label__2 SAX parsing is known to be difficult. Would any other parsing style be an option ? __label__2 I dont know how to apply the read only concept to a for - loop. Or do you mean why they say it is read - only ? __label__2 Fair enough. Shell, can I suggest wacking his userspace drafts while you ' re at it ? __label__2 What programming environment is it being run in? Have you turned up the compiler optimization ? __label__2 With as many website / server / API driven apps are out there, you rarely don ' t want to upgrade. Could I ask why you don ' t want to upgrade, or why you want to preserve your current version ? __label__2 @Andras: Sure, but that ' s not really related to the expansion properties. Let me rephrase: do we have examples of problems that are hard on $d$-regular graphs but easy on $d$-regular expander graphs ? __label__2 It Works For Me (tm). What ' s your O / S ?__label__2 Shouldn ' t we create a format for posting the books? One book with a linked title and a short description of why it ' s recommended and what it ' s about per answer ? __label__2 I noticed your interest in Dirichlet ' s contribution to the problem of <url>. Do you have any information about what Dirichlet did exactly here ? __label__2 What exactly are you trying to select? The element with `$('span . displayField').text()` as the current text ? __label__2 Is your algorithm allowed to reposition existing windows? Would this be too confusing for the user ? __label__2 @Oscar: What type of database are you willing to use? Access, MS SQL, MySQL, Oracle, or other??__label__2 Hi, we worked on a few Australian - related articles together. May be you want to make a look on my <url>?__label__2 <url> is currently an orphaned article. Can you find some articles to link to 'Christa Behmenburg''?__label__2 Have you and I reached a compositional (English, not content) impass? Perhaps we should hash it out away from the article and install after having reached teh big A (accomodation or agreement)?__label__2 It will show whichever class library you had selected as "Set as Startup Project", won ' t it? Did you mean "How can I select which *usercontrol* the testcontainer will show"?__label__2 I noticed you put "NB" and then the credit for the original picture that I cropped. What does "NB" stand for ? __label__2 I ' m currently browsing `[interview - questions]` tag looking for it. Do you have a link if you ' ve found it ? __label__2 Is there something more to your question that you would like answered? More details ? __label__2 Do the stream auto - close when it is deallocated? If not, does it affect the battery life ? __label__2 Are you going to implement your own syntax on top of the scripts (i . e. SQL, Excel etc) that the users are coding ? __label__2 On a different subject, does this article pass <url> and / or <url>? Could it be linked from <url> as the next album ? __label__2 Did you try an iisreset? Maybe an old version of your assembly is still in cache ? __label__2  " I ' m fairly new to java programming (or programming in general)" So, have you used another programming language before? Which one ? __label__2 what do you mean by lock? you can ' t click on lock icon and enter your password to unlock it ? __label__2 BTW, I ' m not certain that Queen Victoria can be described as being the Founder without being somewhat misleading. What do you think ? __label__2 Figured it was broadly agreed and issues broadly resolved. Shall we pick it up then ? __label__2 How does the data look? List A = {(3, 5), (5, 6), (1, 2)} and B would be all the points ? __label__2 The FAQ says Stack Overflow covers "matters that are unique to the programming profession," and this seemed to me like such a matter. Or did I miss something ? __label__2 My rationale for nominating <url> for CSD as promotional was that the show has not yet aired, so an episode summary at this point sounds like a promotional leak. Was I being overzealous ? __label__2 are they in the same namespace ? Usually, different assemblies use different namespaces ? __label__2 When you typed this: http://ww . google . com / search ? client=safari & rls=en & q=string+processing+algorithms & ie=UTF - 8 & oe=UTF - 8" What did you see? Anything you ' d like to ask **Specific** questions about ? __label__2 Greetings, the Province of Alberta, through legislation, has designated a future highway that has an alignment and an assigned number, but has yet to be constructed. Is it premature to create an article on such a highway ? __label__2 I still can ' t remember how I got into this. I remember there was an argument on the GameCube page but then there was nothing for a week or two..It hasn ' t been that long has it ? __label__2 Is the picture showing white ONLY in a browser? Or is it showing white even in windows ? __label__2 For example he says that using std might create problems if user wants to define a vector class, but one could say that creating classes with same names as STD classes is bad practice. Only real problem is count I think, because it can be used in any user created class.. Now is it a big enough reason to type std:: everywhere else to avoid conflit with STD count ? __label__2 I spotted a comment you made at the Help Desk discussion page: "I ' m in the process of sweeping Wikipedia of links to all its question answering departments, and replacing them with a single link in each location to route all questions traffic through an upgraded Wikipedia : Questions page." Do you mind me asking how you "sweep" Wikipedia of all those links? How do you find them all ? __label__2 UIImage *chevronImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"chevron"]; Do you try to add in the image extension in your code ? __label__2 @StealthRT - That seems to me like more of a problem with the .NET framework then rather than Visual Studio. Try re - installing the .NET framework as I think I am correct in saying that a re - install of VS won ' t necessarily re - install this ? __label__2 Will k1 , k2 , k3 be 3 , 4 , 5 in all cases? or was that just an example ? __label__2 The built - in findalls are findall / 3 and findall / 4. Which one are you trying to implement ? __label__2 Which line is the error reported on? Is there anything above this in the file, like an #include ? __label__2 @Silly Cow - another source of bitterness could be that your flour has gone rancid. Do you experience bitterness problems with low sugar quick breads made using the same flour, or are you sure this is a yeast issue ? __label__2 Somebody keeps moving the Shannan Prefecture to Lhoka Prefecture. What is your view on this ? __label__2 Are the box ' s sides always oriented parallel to the x and y axis? Or is it sometimes tilted by some angle ? __label__2 As the most developed of the articles, it may be worth opening a generalist peer review on it, to try and get some idea of whether there ' s anything we ''aren ' t'' aware of. What do you think ? __label__2 Kim, since you ' re the uninvolved admin here, can you just block this <url>? Or do I have to report him to ANI ? __label__2 To this day with the latest release, taking chances, the owner / copyright holder of all of Celine ' s discography is Sony Music Canada- (P) and (C), even though epic and now columbia in NYC is where she is signed to produce recordings. For now, Celine ' s infobox says "CBS Records Canada (1986u20131990)", but since her discography owner / copyright holder is still Sony Canada, should I change this to Sony Music Canada (1986 - present)?__label__2 Sorry, this is just horrible advice (see @GrandmasterB ’ s comment). Why has it got so may upvotes ? __label__2 You said that you set your watchlist to auto - refresh. How do you do this ? __label__2 Ah.. there the problem is! Have you initialised the background position in either HTML style attribute or using jQuery ? __label__2 If both have access to the same save files then you will be fine as long as you ' re not running two copies of Dwarf Fortress at the same time. But what do you mean by running from the same source ? __label__2 What is a bipartite graph, really? http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Bipartite _ graph doesn ' t say the two node sets should have the same numbers of elements .. so one set can be just empty, is that also a bipartite graph ? __label__2 Ping. Are you providing the missing sources or removing the unsourced material, so I can make it pass GA ? __label__2  " a low straggling house" whose rooms were "pretty and decorated xe0 la franxe7aise" ..two of the 19th - century NYTimes citations you removed are the sources for the quotations cited here .. now the quotations don ' t have references. Would you please put them back ? __label__2 Is the required .net framework installed? Does your code have any static initializers that can throw ? __label__2 P . S: Your exams end in May 10th? Are you taking AP Exams by any chance ? __label__2 If we have A:[1 , 2 , 3], B:[1 , 2 , 4] and C:[3 , 4 , 5]. Do we first merge A and B to [1 , 2 , 3 , 4] and then merge it with C (because A+B has 2 in common with C while neither A or B has 2 in common with C ? __label__2 Clarification please. Do you mean "i is from 0 to 2" or rtmp1 [ 3 * 4 * NMAX]?__label__2 Sorry I ' m still not clear, the movies are not just different between cinemas, the movies change too. If one cinema starts playing a new interesting movie while the others haven ' t, this one cinema may have bigger change in gaming sales, no ? __label__2 The article <url> doesn ' t give any sources we can check to prove that it ' s true. I checked on google and I could find almost nothing about him, is it possible that you could <url> a website or a printed source like a book or newspaper report which discusses him ? __label__2 Should string2 be rist or tisr? And in that case wouldn ' t the output be "st str"?__label__2 There are two books I have with more material about this Zen Master; Namu Dai Bosa published in 1976 by The Bhaisajaguru Series, and second: The Soen Roku published by the Zen Studies Society in 1986. Are you familiar with these sources and is there any reason they are not included ? __label__2 What happens if there are inconsistencies? Would that be an exception condition ? __label__2 To make it clear: you don ' t want to muck about with the class or package files themselves, but want to put a command (or something) in between the class being loaded and the package being loaded that "switches off" the option. Am I right ? __label__2 I don ' t recall. Is there something there that could damage my computer ? __label__2 The brainteaser of course is that the <url> documentation subpage currently manages to show all situations working correctly with no red links, yet the same metatemplate called from cite _ web / sandbox is having problems. Is the problem that one template can not accept a winklinked date output from a called metatemplate, or is this really just a problem of my buggy coding skills ?__label__2 Not sure I understand the question. Are you looking for the domain from the `Request` object, user input, a constant, something else ? __label__2 I might have just done a wrong revert on this art - what do you think? Small cf Singapores Changi maybe - but, ..?__label__2 I ' m now thinking the second primary topic on <url> should just serve as an entry, like what you did to the Street Fighter dab <url>. Thoughts ? __label__2 Are you saying programmers get more angry than non - programmers? What are you saying ? __label__2 How does one close Grindstone manually? Can you emulate this in code ? __label__2 Hello - I think you know more about <url> than I do. Want to check it ? __label__2 Which part is inefficient? selecting an item from the table, or strings as keys ? __label__2 Also, does it have to be a hard disc? Could it be flash memory instead ? __label__2 Is *r* necessarily positive? Is it an integer ? __label__2 But the line with `"ClipID"` works? (Also, can you try `var title = element . getElementsByTagName("Title")[0];` instead?)__label__2 As you ' ve noticed, I ' m on a tear through general topology, which was going well, until I went to revise / merge / update <url>, when I stumbled on a very simple conceptual issue. Could you look at the talk page, and tell me what I ' m doing wrong ? __label__2 I tried searching for that link in the section that I was editing and it wasn ' t there I didn ' t edit from the top but just from the section. Does the filter only look inside the section or is it based on the whole talk page ? __label__2 What are you wanting to optimize? Processor, Request Size ? __label__2 I am more than happy to be overruled (and can reopen the question), but this discussion should take place on meta, not in this comment feed. Why don ' t you initiate a discussion there ?__label__2 I get [this](http://i . imgur . com / M4Ab6 . png) output. Except for the slightly overfull hbox, can you please specify what you don ' t like about it ? __label__2 You are obviously very busy. How should I proceed ? __label__2 what does your databasemanager class look like? can you post some code pls ? __label__2 Lol, yes, simply! I would have no objection to something like this "According to ".. Records" the song was sent to mainstream radio as the official third single in may." OR something ? __label__2 I think your question is a bit unclear. When you write add / attach do you mean you want to insert it into the post ? __label__2 Are you sure your DerivedType is inheriting from BaseType. Can you post more code ? __label__2 Did you hit Ctrl+F7 and typed 'someStringList . DoSth' in Evaluate / Modify window ? __label__2 That ' s okay. Did you contest a state by - election in the recent past ? __label__2 You ' re asking about premade engines, but they ' re pretty specific things. What kind of game are you thinking of building ? __label__2 @Cyclops: I think you can edit it to be community wiki and then downvotes won ' t have an effect. Perhaps a moderator can merge the answers of that question with this one ? __label__2 I feel <url> is a personal attack against me. Can you please remove it for me per <url>?__label__2 I am not sure of the question. Do you want problems that are obviously in one of the classes but not the other ? __label__2 What if Aa [ Ca] == Ab [ Cb] > Ac [ Cc] and neither Ca nor Cb point to the end of their respective arrays? Do you increment Ca or Cb ? __label__2 I noticed you added the Arabic for <url>'s name. Do you know the <url>?__label__2 <url> Is there any way I can convince you to change your mind ? __label__2 I agree, more info needed. Is it PHP, .NET, straight HTML, or something else ? __label__2 I see you ' re quite zealous at Croatian articles, so I ' m inviting you to support my <url>. What do you think ? __label__2 What are you using to unit test? Are you using the built in MS unit testing or nunit ? __label__2 Thank you for your answer. Could you please provide some reference (link) for the self - spreading malware attacks ? __label__2 Does Qt give you any kind of warning, can you post the real path too and the output of `ls -la images / Load . png`? Perhaps you have configured the toolbars to display only text ? __label__2 Why don ' t you want to use NSArray? What is it that you are trying to accomplish ? __label__2 What are your initial values for dp [ 0]? Also, the linked question specifically asks for the number of **minimal** set of intervals that cover a particular day; are you sure that this algorithm guarantees that ? __label__2 Is Contradictanym synonym to Auto - antonym? Can the term self - antonym be used ? __label__2 Are we allowed to use a lookup table? How big can it be ? __label__2 It is being suggested on <url> that the recent round of editing of <url> in which you were involved amounted to no more than sanitisation. Perhaps you could advise ? __label__2 If it shows up in `phpinfo()` it should be working. Did you restart your XAMPP after moving the file ? __label__2 +1 .. even though I know where it comes from - see the mmyers answer - i ' ve always wondered why it ' s considered so compelling. Can anyone add to the mmyers answer and explain ? __label__2 TimPF - I don ' t see the objectives as mutually exclusive, the previous creation of the Suburban Rail stubs by others took the content in a direction which I am reinforcing with these edits which fill out the stubs and bring a bit of consistency within the Suburban parts of RTIL. PRTIL could fulfill a similar function for mainline services perhaps ? __label__2 it works, sorry :) another question - it displays only days ago the user last seen, can i use format _ date to this somehow ? __label__2 But make sure you have the right (error) line. What happens when you remove that last Requires ? __label__2 what is the meaning of point 3? how is it different from a simple axis ? __label__2 In what way does the daemon act differently in those two scenarios? Form the perspective of your daemon, how is a shutdown + startup different than a reboot ? __label__2 I am not sure about better tag (I think this one is fine), but someone should edit the question to "What does a Field Theory mean?" or "What is meant by Field Theory?".__label__2 I noticed you have improved the "human rights" section on the article <url>. Could you update the main article: <url>?__label__2 Which seems to be exactly in line with my point about album covers. If you were referring only to logos, could you please qualify why they should be treated differently ? __label__2 Is the ssh _ expect function something you have made yourself? What does it do, exactly ? __label__2 The second one looks right to me. What goes wrong with it ? __label__2 are you talking about getting a code flow trace for the system call, i . e. like <kernel entry> -> syscall dispatcher -> ioctl -> device ioctl for socket -> tcp driver -> .., and back out of there again ?__label__2 I was thinking based on an assumption which is "there should always be something in common in each pc" and if this comon thing is made up by bunch of transistors and if this common thing is able to process an operation, its processing performance can be in relation to 'transistors count' Stupid approach? (So I was asking, what is this common possible process AND how can I measure its performance ? )__label__2 Thanks for doing the DYK update - I saw it was overdue, but had no time to do the notifications (though I would have had time just to copy to the main template and purge the cache). Has there ever been discussion of having a bot do the notices (perhaps with the name of the admin who did the Update given, in case there were questions)?__label__2 I feel like this is probably an issue with your configuration, since I don ' t see why C++ code would behave differently than Obj - C code. Can you post a screenshot of what you ' re seeing ? __label__2 What comes up to me , do the images come from exactly the *same* domain as the the application? Or a different domain ? __label__2 Thank you for semiprotecting that page. Why is it that everyone seems to vandalize one page at the same time ? __label__2 Hi again. Are you still participating in the discussion at Talk : Kirk Cameron ? __label__2 Hi, I ' m still stuck on this question. Is there some other place I can look into to help in this ? __label__2 Is this still a problem? Can you post your logic / code for implementing the en - gb . resx vs en - gb - internal . resx files ? __label__2 These words are, to my mind, completely unrelated. What ' s the difference between *taxi*, *green*, and *kitchen*?__label__2 So does jail breaking an iphone consist of changing file system and directory permissions or is it more complex? If so, does anyone know the low level technical details ? __label__2 You probably missed a setting somewhere - XPS is quite capable of producing sharp output. Can you post the actual exported xps somewhere, and also provide some more information on how you are exporting, as well as what XPS viewer you are using ? __label__2 A lil bit confusing here. Do you want to compare if the Person array have a repeated items ? __label__2 My question is more towards a question on what their titles are. Is Kira, for example, the Yellow Ptera Ranger or the Yellow Dino Ranger ? __label__2 Are you looking for absolutely all possible solutions or for all solutions of maximum length if multiple instances of such solution exist? in order words is solution of 2 sets of length 1 like {54}:{54} an acceptable solution 1 ? __label__2 More like an API to be used by a mobile device. Does it matter what kind of client uses the API ? __label__2 If you need the image to fill either height or width to the corresponding dimensions of the div, I can only think of using javascript. Is that something you are keen to explore ? __label__2 Not sure I understand what your bounty is looking for. This is a wiki, so there ' s no "one right answer" .. what ' s the criteria to win the bounty ? __label__2 In what line of code does the error occur? Is it when you create the FileInfo object or when you start the process ? __label__2 @Jamie, please explain your intention in a few words. Is it your intention to create a buffer overflow exploit ? __label__2 But why is it the noscript element on the same level with 'head' and 'body' in the first place? What is the DOCTYPE of the html ? __label__2 How is the disc? Would you like the peer review to resume ? __label__2 @Orko Is black line a moving target for a missile or car ' s ideal path on racing track? How do you define a success and failure of drawing a red line ? __label__2 Are the rest of your ProcessStartInfo values correct? Particularly, the starting directory ? __label__2 Just reminder, but you tagged <url> with the GAreview tag several days ago. Have you completed your review comments yet ? __label__2 Not sure I understand the question. Could you try and explain please? :)__label__2 Perdon, la pregunta no esta claro. Puedes tratar a simplificar la pregunta ? __label__2 And do you have the same version of your application on both machines? And are you actually starting the version of your application that you think you ' re starting ? __label__2 How much data? Is this a one off job or will you need to run it several times ? __label__2  " However, when initializing the struct using new, Valgrind complains", is that what you wanted to say? Or did you want to say "However, when *using* the struct using new, .."?__label__2 this question is getting flags. Can you improve it or make it more clearly a *question* please ? __label__2 This type of question is best suited for Programmers . SE. In any case, what have you considered so far ? __label__2 Hi Acad - the above has led me to two native Danish speakers on the English wiki - <url> and Saddhiyama--<url> - the first is " very active on naval articles." and has just translated HMS Falcon (1802) for Danish Wiki<url>. Thoughts ? __label__2 How to check this? And if so, how to change ? __label__2 It depends on how you wanted to modify that query. What exactly were you trying to accomplish ? __label__2 That ' s my understanding as well. So what I ' m wondering is, how did you choose where to draw the lines on the map, if there haven ' t been any agreements ? __label__2 @gabriel looks like he ' s setting up his cells. how would you accomplish that?!__label__2 I know and that ' s why I can send emails to phones. Does anyone know of any APIs that don ' t use sendmail to send their email ? __label__2 Doubly linked list? You mean that one should be able to traverse it both ways having an external pointer to _any_ of its nodes ? __label__2 Sorry - you confused me. If language only recognizes keys - shouldn ' t the example your provided be "language = {latin and german}"?__label__2 Could you describe better the part "it stopped". Stopped in what way, gave a runtime error, or .. ?__label__2 i think you should just use what you usually do, avoid getting into stuff that you can ' t get to work. better to just keep it simple, ya know ? __label__2 I ' m confuse here. You didn ' t understand OOP or you disagree with benefits spread by oop proponents ? __label__2 So, a couple of thoughts then - a) instead of saying "XYZ is an SSI", I could say "XYZ is a <url>" and b) instead of just saying "it has been notified as an SSI" I could say something like "because of its <url>, it has been notified as an SSI". If I did those two things would that solve the problem, or do you think I need to do more than that ? __label__2 Sorry, another issue has taken my attention, and I don ' t think I can get to this task. Since you are running AWB, and have thought through how to do the regexes, is there a reason you can ' t make the heading change yourself ? __label__2 Rivers added, changed Treves > Trier, tweaked line (plus some other tidying). Anything else ? __label__2 Thanks for your support. Could you check and give me your opinion on the debate at <url> and, in case you agree with me, ask Critzu to explain himself ? __label__2 Are you asking for sum ? or u asking for a specified value where prodSum ( L1 , L2) < X ?__label__2 Also, all in all, I think Batman should be changed to <url>, not <url>, as the latter refers to those with superhuman powers or abilities, which he lacks. Thoughts ? __label__2 Did you try to go backward? Have you found a function which actually *does* go backward ? __label__2 @Fishtoaster I ' m confused though how to reword it though. What category *is* phpMyAdmin ? __label__2 -- Well, it was a repost of a deleted article. What would be a better tag to use ? __label__2 I see you added a <person> licence to the image but I don ' t see any evidence from the source provided that this licence is proper to the image. Where do you see that this is the correct copyright licence for the image ? __label__2 What have you got so far? Show us where you are stuck: is it on the JOINs, the filtering ? __label__2 JNDI lookup is the way. Can you confirm in your startup logs that the datasource actually deploys ? __label__2 @Chris: it ' s now the second time someone has repeated one of my questions. Copycatting to get votes ? __label__2 Hi, I found two sources which state that <url> was still married and when she moved to Harlem with her Husband. Do you have any sources to the contrary ? __label__2 I can ' t find it. Maybe I didn ' t manage to guess the right name; can you find it in your contribs ? __label__2 Please _show the contents of `stf2`_. How is is displayed when it ' s logged ? __label__2 Which OS? Are you willing to set up a file server with a different OS ? __label__2 Sorry, I know nothing about Python. Is that Pygame and Django just like .Net Base class library ? __label__2 There ' s a vote at <url> to reinstate as the primary topic after a move from <url>. Have an opinion to share ? __label__2 I have to know; has this got you worried about the quality of GeoNames? If I pick one of the ones that is only accurate to the arc minute, will it be worse ? __label__2 This actually seems like a computing question that happens to arise in a physical application, not really a physics question. Or is it just me ? __label__2 I ' m tempted to close this as a withdrawn GAN since it ' s been open nearly 2 months and nobody wants to touch it. What think ? __label__2 Got code to share? If you restart the applications after you establish the remote desktop session, does it work ? __label__2 I really hate it when the camera shop staff think they know what you want more than you do. It wasn ' t Jessops was it ? __label__2 @space _ cadet: that is again confused viewpoint of what entropy means. I guess you ' ll now start telling us that broken egg has lower entropy than unbroken egg (because you can store more information in the egg that is ordered) and so second law predicts that broken eggs will jump back to their shells, right? :-)__label__2 What kind of bike do you have? Are your rims particularly delicate ? __label__2 can you say some more about why you need to synchronize your collection, i . e. does your Data members depend on each other or do you have some kind of logic which looks at all the members at once and cannot handle add or removes ? __label__2 Yes it is a homework question. I ' m just trying to do it correctly, will this be a problem ? __label__2 I ' m just curious. Whats the complete assignment ? __label__2 @Ngu: There is some form of 'solution' for the three body problem. However, is there a 'solution' that converge faster than the using simulation for the same time period ? __label__2 @Maxpm: This compiles for me in Visual Studios 2008. What compiler are you using ? __label__2 I ' d really like to know how to do this without a data plan. An SMS autoresponder that replies with a google maps link to my latitude and longitude ? __label__2 perhaps a stupid question, but you don ' t have some bogus character in your .py file after "unittest"? Does it work from idle or when just starting pyton and typing "import unittest"?__label__2 What is your exact question? How those effects can be achieved in general ('language - agnostic'), or how to do them in java and what libraries are best suited for such a task ? __label__2 Are there any constraints on the variables? E . g. integer type, implicit int->bool conversion, etc ? __label__2 Hello, Peripitus. Will you take a look at this discussion and reconsider the deletion of one image in particular (the deletion I take issue with)?__label__2 About the arrow pawn: it moves one square per turn (if it ' s not Persson ' s variant), right? When it moves two squares in the Persson variant, can it jump ? __label__2 What type of Wifi router is the iMac connecting to? Is it the only device connected to the router when the issue occurs ? __label__2 Hi. Is there any news on the <url>?__label__2 Thanks you! Please, Could you explain what are these options mean ? __label__2 Thanks both for your answers. Could you please direct me to a book / reference where I could find a proof of the fact that for large samples the paired t - test works ? __label__2 I remember seeing a table of bicycle laws in various states, but I forget where. A search isn ' t helping; does anyone remember seeing this ? __label__2 @Michael also pitfalls - are you talking about performance, portability, productivity, interopability? Most have seemed to have assumed you were thinking about Garbage Collection ? __label__2 Hi @philippe. Since it seems like you found the solution, could you please post how you fixed your problem for future readers of this question ? __label__2 is this really a photography question? Seems more like a technical user manual for a piece of equipment question..?__label__2 It appears the question posted to your comment <url> was not answered. Out of curiosity, where is the correct place ? __label__2 The standard would be <person> (as we discussed at some length at the proposals page), to avoid the clumsy double plural. Any objection if I change it back ? __label__2 Whose delegate? The view controller ' s ? __label__2 I was thinking on it, but one question: I see several articles either deleted or promoted to FA after the oldid the sweeps uses. I ' m assuming we simply ignore these ? __label__2 What kind of traffic do these roads see? How many lanes in each ? __label__2 Do you actually have a system with `sys / ioctl . ph` properly installed on it? Which one ? __label__2 What ' s the actual error code? Do you have many small files or few big files in there ? __label__2 I would think the name of the document might be less of an issue than the subject, recipient address and body of the message that you send it with. Do you also need the rest of the email to be encrypted ? __label__2 But since it ' s a scatter plot, what would the color bar indicate? Should it correspond to the size of each point, `s`, or the color of each point, `c`?__label__2 To continue Jason ' s questions, what constitutes a "square of any size?" Four corners, the outline of a square, a solid tile ? __label__2 Ok, I will. What is the StackOverflow policy, editing the start post or should I make a new answer with all code ? __label__2 Slightly underspecified: by 'arrange', you do mean place them in order at the start of the array? Any restrictions on what happens to the rest of the integers ? __label__2 Can we assume contiguous IDs in [Employee Schedule] make a range? Or only [Day ID]?__label__2 as far as I can remember Eclipse can generate the WSDL. What editor are you using ? __label__2 My old pre had this too! oh Palm, why must you have been so horribly marketed ? __label__2 That doesn ' t seem possible to me. Got an example ? __label__2 what is the expected number of points? Is it a handful like 3 , 4 , 5 or could it be 20 or 100 ? __label__2 What sort of weight would the tripod need to carry on it? Does the 500g target include the head ? __label__2 <url>. What do you think should be done ? __label__2 Could you be a bit clearer ? How is your line represented ?__label__2 Since the _\citation{}_ and _\bibcite{}_ commands are in the .aux files, it should be quite easy to extract the relevant entries from a BibTeX database. Has no - one written such a tool ? __label__2 Hi there, seems like your warning to <url> didn ' t work and the IP user has again removed sourced information on the <url> article. Is it time to block the IP user ? __label__2 Stu: I have this terrible pain whenever I twist my arm around this way. What should I do ? __label__2 That makes me wonder what algorithm inbuilt tablediff utility uses ? Anyone ?__label__2 This seems like a recipe request to me: "step by step comprehensive guide". What exactly are you having trouble with ? __label__2 I though these were generated when you Build the application, since it ' s ready to run at that point and those files are required for Debugging. Do you get them if you "Start Debugging" in Visual Studio ? __label__2 I agree, this is pretty much a subset of the earlier question. What ' s in this question that ' s not just a more focused subset of the earlier question ? __label__2 This is an effective duplicate of http://gamedev . stackexchange . com / questions / 22 / best - place - for - learning - how - to - write - games - in - unity3d Can we close and mark as duplicate ? __label__2 Actually I didn ' t even realise you could write `[](u) { .. }` and have the compiler figure out the type of `u` for you, so that may be where I ' m getting lost. In any case, the workaround is to put `[](T u) { .. }` so is that really a big deal ? __label__2 Can you see all the edits I have done? Is there a chat feature here to speed up communication, I would like to ask you a few quick questions if I may, please ? __label__2 I think what #8 means is: that it has either one value or all nulls. Wouldn ' t Min ( Null) = Null return all nulls ? __label__2 I think the <url> would be more precise and accurate as <url>. What sayest thou ? __label__2 @Joe Hmm, I guess I would call them both of those jam -- they seem to be approximately the same condiment to me. :) Maybe the mashed fruit one could also be called a conserve ? __label__2 Homework? What have you tried so far ? __label__2 Can you clarify what it is that you ' re trying to do? What queries do you want to support ? __label__2  " I ' ve *never* heard of Clamshell Lighting. What is it, and when should it be used?" :)__label__2 Whipped up <url> the other day. Interested ? __label__2 Ouch - sorry! But once I arrived at music, Genesis wasn ' t that far from genius - does that count ? __label__2 That makes sense! Is it OK if decking runs across that area? Air can flow through the 1 1 / 5" gap and down to under the deck, right ? __label__2 It should be possible to export from mathematica to eps I believe, or even to other formats, like png or gif (maybe from the "File" menu). Could you try and see if it works ? __label__2 I can ' t find any API documentation. Can you provide it ? __label__2 @Jherico I ' ve dabbled a little in COM, though I can ' t think of anything in there that would accomplish this. Can you give a useful example ? __label__2 i tried to get the angles and add 90 to the angles of the axis i want to rotate about ,but i don ' t know if this i true, can anyone give me a general algorithm??__label__2 I am having trouble finding evidence of Wacu0142awowo in Avondale. There don ' t appear to be any sources; is it possible that the spelling is off ? __label__2 Thanks for pointing that out, however, several of those figures are listed with their full names in some of the sources. What to do then ? __label__2 Can you tell why breakpoints are crosslined? they should be blue round button, not crosslined, can you see that ? __label__2 Take another look in my sandbox. Would that work to show the change of flag ? __label__2 What ' s the exception thrown? Does it really save the file ? __label__2 Just noticed the compact on the evolution talk page. Are you going to reframe the discussion ? __label__2 I have found that SQL Server 2008 R2 has some issues depending on the Operating System of the Database Server. What Operating System is the server ? __label__2 Your POV tag justified. Did you get any support for cleaning it up ? __label__2 @Vor: Isn ' t this the same as asking "Which problems can be polynomial - time Turing reduces to integer factorization?" Or did you intend to ask something else ? __label__2 Mac OS X Server comes with an FTP server built in. Is there something specific you ' re looking for that it doesn ' t do ? __label__2 The problem using mapreduce here, is that you need a common key to feed your reducer. How is the compareTo() going ? __label__2 What would you get if you just read the file and printed the name straight from Ruby? That is, is it Ruby that ' s choking on the encoding, or does it only get truncated once it ' s been through the DB ? __label__2 @brian, you cannot mark community wiki. Do you have a specific answer that you are looking for ? __label__2 I ' ve not used glut before, but it seems odd that a window would be receiving input messages if it *didn ' t* have focus. Are you sure this is something you need to do manually ? __label__2 I ' m confused. Why does `\begin { figure}..\end { figure}` not work for you for setting figures in only a single column ? __label__2 What do you mean "There aren ' t any options to turn off the plugin"? Do you mean that the plug - in won ' t deactivate or that the plug - in is required and deactivating it isn ' t an option ? __label__2 Thanks.

Who said that Wikipedia administrators were not romantics ? __label__2 @Tyler Eaves How can this be done? What tools do you use ? __label__2 The oracle $B$ is unnecessary here: since, by (3) $M \neq N$, we can take $B$ to be the empty oracle.

Shall I carry on the review, or shall I wait for a cue from your side when you ' re ready to carry on ? __label__2 Do we need to go that far?

How many items total are there, if there ' s a limit at all ? __label__2 These guys wanting that link to the leaked script on the page don ' t seem to be going away.

Some type of error encountered ? __label__3 +1 Cool, I think I have been invited to an event through this a very long time ago. Could you please make the link an actual link to the site and edit your answer to show anyvite measures up to the requirements ? __label__3 Thank you for the additional information.

Sorry, I lost you — which part of the question are you referring to ? __label__3 This begs the question: why? What purpose does the element serve ? __label__3 Is it homework? Why not return a `Maybe a` in `pop` and `top`?__label__3 What are your intentions after two months? Will you continue your previous deletions ? __label__3 Hi johnny88, I ' m on a Solaris server and there is no manual entry for expect. Can you please elaborate your answer ? __label__3 A quick question: I ' ve noticed that people (including yourself) have been moving links to other wikis from the top of the article to the bottom. If this a good thing to do, then I can do likewise, but I wondered if there was a rationale / convention here ? __label__3 What if it doesn ' t solve my problem? Do people take it personally ? __label__3 How do you define optimal? How large are you data (is brute force an option)?__label__3 It looks like the string is double encoded: first Html Encoded and then URL encoded. Why is that so ? __label__3 It is the choice of template name as "Shinto2" which seems IMHO poor for use within an article (i . e. the "2" bit), hence suggestion of <nowiki><url></nowiki> (distinct from <nowiki><url></nowiki> currently used for various talk page headers), or if you don ' t like that as a name then perhaps <nowiki><url></nowiki> (invoked as <person>) ?__label__3 yes, just put all these lines inside your function and replace the actual values with the argument names. what ' s the problem ?__label__3 I looked at <url> and at <url>, which says in part '' Contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourcedu2014whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionableu2014should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.<url>'' I guess the question is, what is contentious ? __label__3 I ' m sorry I don ' t follow you Ok, this is where I would tell my popup to close. But `window . close()` won ' t work here either, will it ? __label__3 The article now contains material about the crest. Are there any other reasons for your opposition ? __label__3 I think you may get more answers if you take some time to re - write your question and attempt to clarify what exactly you ' re asking. Could you give an example, for instance ? __label__3 Assume each string in Python has 30 bytes of overhead. If you multiply 30 bytes by the number of fields per record and the number of records (30M) and add in 1 . 5GB, what do you get ? __label__3 The Wikipedia article on Boyer - Moore (http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Boyer % E2 % 80 % 93Moore _ string _ search _ algorithm) includes an explanation of Horspool ' s. Which parts of that explanation do you find unclear ? __label__3 In what way is it failing? Exception ? __label__3 Strongly depends on what you do. What do you do ? __label__3 I ' m confused. Can I just edit it, or should I ask here first ? __label__3 Perhaps you need to define 'best'. Also did you mean 3D k - sided polyhedron instead of polygon ? __label__3 Your request just slows down users, without changing what they see. Are you sure that is what you want ? __label__3 Why do you need the javax . microedition . lcdui . Image? Will Bitmap not work for you ? __label__3 <url> has been blanked. Is it possible to retrieve this information ? __label__3 Post the exception that occured - preferably including stack trace. Is it perhaps `InvalidOperationException` and you have a library with it ' s own .config ? __label__3 @Jennifer S Sorry, one more question: do you chop them before to saute' them in a skillet ? Can I use olive oil as well ?__label__3 Why did you "nowiki" the unblock template? Is it just here for show, or do you want it to be considered ? __label__3 Restored history. Can check that I did it all ok ? __label__3 $() and $j()? why? do you use jQuery . noConflict()?__label__3 Newer SIM cards should have anti - tamper protection that makes it useless if you try to clone it. Have you already succeeded in cloning one ? __label__3 Yet another question: one of the frames from your example gif describes a route that is not really a simple path (this one: http://imgur . com / 0vjvr . png). Are that kind of route (or rather spanning tree) allowed as a valid solution for your problem ? __label__3 Re <url>, can you be more specific? Which IP address or range was blocked ? __label__3 He ' s returned to the same trolling he was doing years ago. If he really wants to edit in good faith, why not insist he make some non - controversial edits for a while instead of immediately restarting a two year old edit war ? __label__3 Any update? Have you found out why they ' re requesting these details ? __label__3 By the way, Hammersoft, I am willing to have a fair view of Delta. So, tell me: What good things has he ever done ? __label__3 Why can ' t you just put the data in a database and let that organise the data for the fastest search results (i . e. indices on the criteria you will search the data by)?__label__3 Mou017ce dawniej sekundnik w ogxf3le nie istniau0142?

Is this what you ' d expect a typical encyclopedia to be covering ? __label__3 what do you think? speedy or wiktionary ? __label__3 At a glance, I can ' t see anything wrong with the code (I have an app that uses UIImagePNGRepresenation the same way you do). What exactly is going wrong ? __label__3 This question could be compressed to "How do I define a custom key binding in eclipse?". Was the eclipse bashing really necessary ? __label__3 This is currently used, com . sun . org . apache . xerces . internal . impl . XMLStreamReaderImpl. Is there a better one which I should be switching to ? __label__3 @aroth: Ouch. Don ' t you ever need to view side - by - side diffs ? __label__3 I kept reading that as "T ( 1) = (2 T ( n))", but I think you meant "T ( 1) = 2, and T ( n) = [..]". Correct ? __label__3 What you linked to looks good, but what was I supposed to compare it with again? Got a link ? __label__3 Which authorities are you referring to? Can you give the name of a linguist / grammarian who considers that removing the accents from a French, Polish or Serbian person ' s name creates an exonym ? __label__3 Can you please change the question to 'What idiom starts out like "I ' m going to start taking names and.."?' instead of just 'What is this idiom?'__label__3 I dunno, but this one reeks of that banned user <url> - same mark - as - minor edits, same targets. Care for a look at this ? __label__3 Did you read the census appendix that I have provided? It itself says not to trust it ? __label__3 Your question is great, unfortunately it ' s very similar to a previous (very highly rated) [question](http://stats . stackexchange . com / questions / 3). Perhaps you could change your question to just ask about websites ? __label__3 You shouldn ' t need to do any of that stuff in code if your MVC app has a correct system . servicemodel web . config entry.

How ' s what I wrote on his talk page look ? __label__3 You ' re checking for "s1" in your code, but you ' re saying "S1" in the post. Case sensitive ? __label__3 why doesn ' t `str ( b)` work for you? What is the error message ? __label__3 I am waiting for some belly rubs, and my little fangs are sticking out! Can you believe it, in real life I ' m exactly that cute ? __label__3 OK @Juan - the meta question has established unequivocally that questions like this are definitely allowed. Could you "un - close" it now ? __label__3 <url>. Are you planning to merge the info into <url> or just redirect to the article as is ? __label__3 Now that I thought we had this figured out as clean and simple, but Google has expanded their street view to the south end of Smith - Dorrien Trail which shows a sign naming it Trail<url> rather than Spray Lakes Road. What do we do if there is a contradiction between a reliable map (the Canmore map) and actual signage ? __label__3 I ' ve commented on this on the talk page. Could it be resolved there, rather than both of you just reverting each other ? __label__3 I ' m a bit puzzled what ' s going on with this template, and the two articles that include it. This should really just be one merged article, with redirects as appropriate, no ? __label__3 Annotations aren ' t executable code, so this is unlikely. What are you really trying to do - in what conditions would you want a test to be run or not run ? __label__3 I don ' t get it, Tintor2. Why do you think Sephiroth is not <url>?__label__3 Thanks for the approval :) But as I said, my photoshop - fu is weak on this. Can you please post a tutorial ? __label__3 Did you try both solutions suggested in the thread you linked to? Did they not work for some reason ? __label__3 since the 2 cogs are interlocked. How would you suggest they can run 'out of phase'?__label__3 Okay - later tonight (I ' m a bit busy right now), I ' ll restore them for.. hm. Will three days be long enough for you to copy the information ? __label__3 Hmm, Dev, Jet123 ' s nom doesn ' t really count as your second one, right?

Does your source say that specifically ? __label__3 sounds like homework. what have you figured out so far ? __label__3 Are you there? I just posted YAP, Yet Another Plea, on <url>, might you wish to pitch in with something technical or at least magisterial ? __label__3 Is your name like A <url>? Is the 'A' a negation as to imply that you are not squid ? __label__3 Why do you use mysql (2 . 8 . 1) ? I think you can ' t use both for one application, do you have this 2 gems in your GemFile ?__label__3 The article was using the later White Ensign in any case (now corrected). How many other RN ships in service pre - 1801 have the wrong flag shown ? __label__3 ..why not try something a bit more proactive? Now, obviously he ' s using proxies, but are there no rangeblocks that might make his job harder ? __label__3 Again samething with the second site, again outside of taking they ' re word for it how do we know they are are right. What is your opinion on the 2 logos in the forum discussion think they were made up ? __label__3 What is an error? NotSuppeortedException in watch window or not sending request ? __label__3 What your code does it to add the line as a graphic to the dataView.

MC, do you think I should withdraw the CU or let it ride ? __label__3 What do mean by "theme"? a prompt theme ? __label__3 Birth place of Arnie. Can you proof read what has been translated so far from German wiki and translate the remainder ? __label__3 If you were falsely accused of vandalism, the best thing to do is to talk to the user who accused you, and explain why your edit was not vandalism. Which user accused you vandalism ? __label__3 Would you please edit the title and text to specify that this is a question about MSN camera support in Empathy? Also: what do you mean by "I have problem to change files with it too"?__label__3 There are many articles without an infobox image because nobody has found a free alternative. Wasn ' t there one of Singer at Comic - Con ages ago ? __label__3 Those coordinates look correct: longitudes should precede latitudes (to retain the positive orientation of the coordinate system: horizontal displacements must precede vertical displacements) and values in the SE US should have longitudes around -86 and latitudes around +30. In what sense, then, is anything "reversed"?__label__3 I found <url>, which we don ' t have on en : wiki. Know anyone to do a proper translation ? __label__3 Is there any reason cache the popularity of the object inside the object, while you have to calculate it anyway? Wouldn ' t the order in the array be sufficient ? __label__3 Thank you, that ' s exactly what I needed. I ' m not completely sure of what you mean when you talk about the overdispersion (sorry, I ' m not a statistician, maybe it ' s something very basic).. You say that the residual deviance should be equal to the residual degrees of freedom.. how would I check that ? __label__3 What would you want to happen in those cases? No resizing at all ? __label__3 Which was, to my knowledge, notabilified. Is that a word ? __label__3 You might want to re - architect this; if you are counting the number of files / folders every minute, you are creating a race condition. What about having each function update a counter, or use a lockfile to ensure that the periodic process doesn ' t update the count until both functions have finished executing ? __label__3 I ' m going to say that this should probably be put on http://serverfault . com . I believe you are wanting to set up Virtual Access Points ? __label__3  ' Scope probes often come with a small plastic screwdriver. Do yours fit ? __label__3 I bow to your superior knowledge of Irish :-) One question - the Irish Wikipedia is called Vikipedia? How so - there ' s no 'v' in the Irish alphabet ? __label__3 If no one ever objects no consensus will ever be formed ? yes ? __label__3 No, I don ' t have that. Do you have a <url> account for PS3 ? __label__3 Hi - there are a few issues that I ' ve pointed out at the nomination page. Also, why does your sign link to the talkpage of <url>?__label__3 OK--this calls for a spamuserblock, no two ways about it. Do you agree ? __label__3 Using what? Html ? __label__3 What tutorial did you find? What did you not understand about the examples presented there ? __label__3 Okay. When will it start ? __label__3 I haven ' t received an answer but it wasn ' t reverted. What does this mean ? __label__3 Step 1: acquire a piglet. (seriously, what ' s your geography?)__label__3 It ' s hard for me to imagine a content type with >100 fields and it ' s even harder to imagine if that it would be the best and most usable solution for any problem. Can you explain which problem you ' re trying to solve ? __label__3 I don ' t see what you mean with this question, nor can I imagine what kind of answer you search. Could you please elaborate more ? __label__3 Are you expecting that you don ' t know what huffman symbol is the 'EOF' symbol? Why not just add an extra one to the code to represent EOF, and fill preallocated blocks with that symbol ? __label__3  " Book" in question is A4 or thereabouts, and runs to a grand total of 32 pages including covers. It does state that it is a journal of SIAS, No 18 / 1988. There ' s not much to choose between the two templates though, is there ? __label__3 I was discussing this with Ling .

Do you really want to do it with CSS ? __label__3 Hi again. How do you become an administrator ? __label__3 Sorry, I still have trouble grasping scope of your issue. May be you could add actual code to the question so it is more clear what it currently does and what needs to be improved ? __label__3 Hi, I was just curious as to why you seem to have vandalized <url> to say Gartnerpedia instead of Wikipedia. Any reason for this ? __label__3 I don ' t know if this will help, but what do you get if you use a different language? Does changing to English and then back to Italian change things ? __label__3 Have you been able to find anything confirming that last result yet? Is it being challenged in court ? __label__3 Advantages in comparison with what? Unbalanced trees, AVL trees, hash tables, ..?__label__3 You made three other edits to the <url> article on 25 November 2007. Can you explain why ? __label__3  " Crudo"? You mean raw fish like sashimi ? __label__3 ohh man it ' s messed up now. How do I add code to the comments??__label__3 Hello - someone moved <url> to a new title with diacritics - and a hyphen, which nobody in the talk page had ever discussed. How does one undo that ? __label__3 Are those backticks (`) surrounding the column names and table name? Did you try the query with regular single - quotes (')?__label__3 please, can you explain what do you mean? I ask question and I need the solution if you have.. Is there is any problem with my question ? __label__3 Not to start a war, but I can see another side to that. Why develop (test, deploy, maintain) two solutions where one will do ? __label__3 Would it be possible for you to link to exact url? Is the url live somewhere ? __label__3 @Unsure The quote from your notes doesn ' t say "array" anywhere. Are you sure you ' re not dealing with linked lists, where the advantage is clear ? __label__3 @Tim Why not posting this as an answer? Please ? __label__3 But the Bayes formula says something like the sum / something, is it enough to know those probabilities? Could you please post an example ? __label__3 @user1567: You add the function to the `wp _ ajax _ myaction` and `wp _ ajax _ admin _ myaction` hooks. Should that not be `wp _ ajax _ myaction` (for logged in users) and `wp _ ajax _ nopriv _ myaction` (for anonymous users)?__label__3 Ok, that seems acceptable. Did I remove something like that ? __label__3 If I were to find information on the typical age of instance for hyperparthyroism / OFC, what section would that fall under? Epidemology ? __label__3 Why is ''<url>'' a better name for this page than ''<url>'', which has now been made a redirect page? Is it not standard to speak of "great circle distance"?__label__3 Dougweller, I still don~t understand. Are you saying Antonio Rumeu de Armas is a primary source BUT Samuel Elliot Morison is not a primary source ? __label__3 The minimum sum would be found by taking the smallest number, then subtracting all other numbers from it. Do you mean "closest to zero"?__label__3 Hey. Did you get my last e - mail ? __label__3 Ok I ' ve moved <url> back to <url>. Oleg you want to write something on the talk page about the move ? __label__3 I don ' t understand what you mean by 'all pairs'. Say you have three coordinates (x, y, and z) such that x dominates y and y dominates z. Is your answer ((x , y), (y , z), (x , z)) ?__label__3 The article has been heavily rewritten since your remark / objection on <url>. How is the article now ? __label__3 @belisarius, Sorry I did not mention; It is the worst case that I am interested in. And anyways, how would one differentiate between these in this scenario ? __label__3 What do you mean by find? How do you determine which half is irrelevant ? __label__3 Okay, fair enough. But if they ' re necessary, could we find a less complex and eyeglazing ''name'' for them ? __label__3 What type is 'ch'? Should it be a signed character ? __label__3 May I also ask how CheckUser became involved in the matter? To justify such a use of computer records, surely someone needs to invoke a due process of some kind for the action to be justified ? __label__3 I ' ll have a look (probably just for copyediting duties) once Zag has finished the larger changes. Keep me posted ? __label__3 what is a seawall? (It is a name that is only used in the USA?)__label__3 O ( n) relative to what?

Did I hurt your feelings ? __label__3 Yes, I do have the Family Guy DVD collection, Volume 1, Seasons 1 & 2. What ' s up ? __label__3 I ' d definitely consider 1 month ' s semi as an alternative, but with no recent history of protection I ' d be reluctant to go beyond that. So.. is PC1 / 3 - months OK, or would semi / 1 - month be better ? __label__3 As @Willie Wong says, marginpars are already floats and should not end up overlapping (although they may not end up where you want them to and long ones may overflow the bottom of the page, for which problem there is the marginfix package). Are you using some unusual class or package that redefines `\marginpar`?__label__3 Wow. That video.. I ' m drooling.

How do you pick the colors from the color space so that the distance between them is maximal ? __label__3 So as you ' re iterating through an array you want to remove objects from it. How do you expect to keep track of what ' s in the array if you ' re changing that same array on every iteration ? __label__3 Here ' s a question for you: I have seen "kvatrutafl" identified as <url>.

Given that, why not just type `:t \f x -> \g -> g (f x g)` into GHCi and see what it tells you ? __label__3 This isn ' t the solution BUT, You can ' t assign values to a NULL pointer as you do in the start of tree _ add IF the tree pointer is NULL, also you do not return any pointer from the function even though you specified that the tree _ add function should return something ? __label__3 Mailing lists are so last century. What about a private wiki ? __label__3 I ' ve been running into your super stub articles while organizing a category. Are these all FOIA requests ? __label__3 I added mention of the river.

Are you confusing *square numbers* (numbers raised to the power of two) and *powers of two*?__label__3 I ' m not sure this is much of a layout challenge in any real sense (get the font right, adjust a few parameters). Perhaps some more focused questions on aspects of the adjustments might be better ? __label__3 David - On looking through the list of the various Israel Prize categories the Israel Prize Categories page, I note that architecture appears twice, once as "Category : Israel Prize in architecture recipients" and again as "Category : Israel Prize recipients in architecture".

Is this a problem no matter how high the resolution of the images ? __label__3 ..This may just mean that I ' m willing to expand my view of the word "ancestor" arbitrarily far, although finding a ribosome - like organism sans nucleic acids and a replicating RNA - like organism sans proteins would probably break it. On the other hand, it ' d be really cool and help explain abiogensis, so, who ' d really care ? __label__3 No. Why do you ask ? __label__3 don ' t you only need the for loop to go up to half of the number you are tying to find the primality of? e . g if your number was 100, then 50 is the biggest number that could possibly be a factor of it, no ? __label__3 Was it prepared on board or was it a commercial product?

You want the showing of more information to be done with JavaScript, right ? __label__3 Silly question: does it maybe need more salt ? __label__3 Interesting how the possible duplicate question is flourishing with a score of +21 and 26 answers, and this one is closed as off - topic. Is it because the asker said "I think this is way better"?__label__3 I ' m sorry, that doesn ' t really make sense. What is your question ? __label__3 The links were removed but, what rule says it is best to "double space"? And what do you plan to rewrite exactly ? __label__3 done. Also, I edited your title to be easier to scan -- is this what you had in mind ? __label__3 You are just saying that <math>frac { f ( x+h)-f ( x)}{h}</math> is continuous at <math>h=0</math>, but that is not the same as saying <math>f'(x)</math> is continuous.

Btw, how do you do in - comment markup ? __label__3 The first sentence is too long to understand. can you show us exactly what is your problem ? __label__3 I reverted <url> as it complicated my normal routine archiving of all the discussions on my talk page.

How to implement the transition table then??__label__3 It would seem to me that this category provides no overall benefit to wiki and only serves as another list of organizations which seem to be targeted by the generally negative tone of LGAT articles. Would it make more sense, or be more proper, to include the relevant categories on the individual articles themselves, rather than have an LGAT category ? __label__3 David, your recent edit to <url> includes a mysterious (but tantalizing) sentence fragment "One nice approach", and some extra line breaks.

(but u do see why u need to learn c /c++ right?)__label__3 I ' m not sure about your question, but are you sure that is correctly implementing the [Fibonacci sequence?](http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Fibonacci _ numb).

Why do you ask ? __label__3 Thanks for editing this to provide a clearer statement of an interesting question, @Graham. @Thunderror - does that capture what you were interested in ? __label__3 I think you made a mistake in merging <url> onto <url> instead of <url>. Or did you want to do further editing before actually adding the material into <url>?__label__3 Are those regexps? Otherwise you should probably use `str _ replace` instead and see if that works better ? __label__3 with 2) I get an parsing error the 1) I dont ' t get it :S, what do I have to do ? __label__3 Is it OK that I don ' t edit wikipedia? It ' s because lots of other people have done it but I don ' t want to so can I still go on ? __label__3 Modules are required to return a true value when being loaded.

Just curious ? __label__3 I have voted in support of them restoring that picture of the Eye Gouge. I will also ask, why don ' t you vote in it ? __label__3 At <url>, your 'outside comment' contains the statement "You don ' t go deleting things with a consensus, and then blast those who have the nerve to reprimand you. " This seems self - contradictory: did you mean to type 'without'?__label__3 Did you move it to the talk page? did youuse the "<nowiki><person></nowiki> template, the section with <nowiki><person></nowiki> or if the entire article is unsourced by adding <nowiki><person></nowiki> or <nowiki><person></nowiki>"?__label__3 OnDrawItem sounds good.

Is it possible that the E1 class were the rebuilds of the 118 class ? __label__3 Actually meant this to go up under Cunard ' s comment above, but the new love - heart thingumyjig doesn ' t have that subtlety. See these new wikilove templates are pretty nifty atren ' t they ? __label__3 Unfortunately, on the topic you have chosen, the excellence of what you are doing is far from the only issue. Are you producing an excellent article of a kind that should not actually be in Wikipedia but in some other more specialized project ? __label__3 Eh, thanks, Sometimes impressing is too easy. Do you want to review the windmill article above ? __label__3 Can you please help me how can I do that? Whit some code example ? __label__3 Which ID section are you asking about?

Is it because cauliflower is much denser and more tightly packed ? __label__3 An editor you recently blocked for a week, <url>, is now editing the same articles and topics under an IP account <url>. Is this allowed or should it just be ignored ? __label__3 I find it odd you have to define both the height and the width for an image, when your are displaying the image are you defining the width and height already? eg. `<img src="" height="y" width="x">` and have you tried using `display: none` instead of the visibility property ? __label__3 Is this on a server you control (ie. can set sv _ cheats on)?__label__3 Wait, what ' s the COI? Was this on the fringe noticeboards ? __label__3 I ' m not sure what needs doing now, or if there are further modifications required (this is the first article I ' ve ever nominated for GA). Is there anything you can point me in the direction of ? __label__3 Please answer the question fully. Which other accounts have you edited as ? __label__3 There are many general purpose languages. What ' s your problem with that ? __label__3 Did you mean to also remove the Breitbart reference from the "Incidents" section? Have I missed a meeting ? __label__3 @S .

One small sidenote: I was unable to reproduce the browser issue - what steps are needed for that ? __label__3 Are you aware that this problem is NP - complete (e . g.: via Subset Sum)?__label__3 so you ' re saying that <img src="local / file . jpg" /> works but <img src="http://server . com / img / file . jpg" /> does not work? Am I understanding right now ? __label__3 @Laurence Gonsalves: Oh? What, then, is the ubiquitous _C string_ if it is not a string ? __label__3  # On the other hand, linking years of actual encyclopedic events to "1949 in NASCAR" or "1950 in motor racing" <s>gives us a tool for eventually building those year - in - topic articles</s> automatically builds those categories. Where some don ' t exist yet (like 1949 in both NASCAR and motor racing), are we better off adding the desired link and letting it be redlinked until the article is created, or just leaving it unlinked or wikilinked to the general year article such as <url>?__label__3 I ' m not sure I get it. How was that missing context ? __label__3 Reading the DYK criteria, I see that an inline reference must be placed immediately after the extraordinary fact being used as a hook, and I don ' t see anything extraordinary immediately before the inlines.

Perhaps it ' s your shoes ? __label__3 both just link to disambiguation pages, where the right people don ' t seem to be represented. Also, my information is that <url> took the post in 1889, while you have 1899. What was your source ? __label__3 No, I said that targetting images merely because of their uploader would be considered wikistalking- I explicitly said I did not want to accuse anyone of anything. Which images do you feel have been tagged incorrectly ? __label__3 you need to clarify what variables the `summation` applies to in your equation? is it summing over all `i` and `j` for each slice (color in the third dimension) or do you want the sum over all values ? __label__3 I could swear I ' ve seen this identical title before, but I can ' t seem to find the duplicate. Anyone ? __label__3 I was profoundly puzzled by the sentence "his bowling career ended due to safety issues of spectators" but I know nothing about cricket. Does that sound plausible ? __label__3 this could be a very interesting problem if I could only understand what you mean.. is it like a Hamiltonian path problem? "i to i+1" between as many nodes as possible ? __label__3 Yeah, I agree. What ' s up with that ? __label__3 From what I can understand, it ' s not clear what is the response variable and the explanatory variable. Can you please clarify this ? __label__3 What do you mean by user agent? The browser ? __label__3 Why do you change from `print` to `printf` when you print to a filehandle? (Also, why are you still using global `FILEHANDLE`s instead of lexically scoped variables?)__label__3 Are you the same user as http://stackoverflow . com / users / 872302 / user872302? If not, could you explain briefly why you have the same IP address and is posting similar questions ? __label__3 Thailand has no dates. Where do you look it up to get those ? __label__3 I included a screenshot. Do u have any idea ? __label__3 A gaussian is unbounded. Am I missing something ? __label__3 @gooshgoosh: Youve left out the most important detail: what are you using (programming language, software, etc.) to do the translation ? __label__3 I agree that terms like Australian Formula 1 need an explanation but isn ' t that why we link the term to the Australian Formula 1 page? Do we need to disrupt the flow of the article to explain a term which is already explained on the linked page ? __label__3 Aren ' t you supposed to move a page rather than just copy and paste it, to preserve the edit history for copyright purposes? And don ' t you have to move the talk page too ? __label__3 Is there really any serious debate that Mobile IE is remotely comparable to Safari mobile? What source would be acceptable to show this ? __label__3 two programs (processes) and two threads are completely different sets of beasts. which do you mean ? __label__3 Why this particular number anyway? Is that the one related to some recent bug ? __label__3 I can ' t replicate this at all. Maybe try flipping the hardware switch or Fn+F5 (or whatever your key is)?__label__3 Which shell? How have you tried to do this so far ? __label__3 I ' ve been called a British unionist, Devolutionist & Irish Nationalist, over the years. Not bad, eh ? __label__3 Please provide more details: will you host more websites on a server? How are you uploading files ? __label__3 I agree it is a bit hectic how active the conversation is. Would you like to take it to #wikipedia ?__label__3 It ' s pretty unclear. Where do you want to add an overlay view without using a `UIImagePickerController`?__label__3 While I don ' t want to discourage non - technical questions, I can ' t see how this one can possibly be answered, other than "it depends", or possibly "when the artist is dead". Maybe it could be rephrased as "What are approaches for defining the scope of a photographic project?"__label__3 Confirmed. Maybe there ' s nothing on that site yet ? __label__3 Are they tied to specific users or just generic? Are they grouped in any fashion ? __label__3 I don ' t understand. Do you want to make a screen shot of the rendered DIV and save that to an image ? __label__3 My daughter ' s earbuds magnetize TOGETHER, not opposing and they shocked her once. Anyone know why ? __label__3 US national defense for the twenty - first century: the grand exit strategy By Edward A.

For whom? ;-)__label__3 I hate categorizing and I ' m guessing you know which would be most appropriate for <url> article. Would you mind ? __label__3 No reason what so ever. But what storage backend should I use that fits the bill ? __label__3 So you want to replace `door` and `sky` with `0`? Ur unset them ? __label__3 I ' d prefer it to be more generic, but that it SHOULD include the UK. Surely there must be Mint . com clones that have worldwide coverage ? __label__3 I noticed that you removed the section " Failure to prevent the attacks" from the 9 / 11 attacks talk page yesterday and moved it unceremoniously to <url> without a single word of explanation. Please explain why ? __label__3 I ' m wondering why extractObject()'s return type is `const bool` and why it says `const int&` as one of it ' s parameter. What is the advantage ? __label__3 You appear to have created a duplicate of <person> at <person>. Is there any particular reason for this ? __label__3 Website or WebApp project? Debugging in Cassini or IIS ? __label__3 Are you sure that you want to withdraw your nomination to delete the 2 old articles? Don ' t you want the 2 articles deleted since they have been merged into something much better ? __label__3 Is this a homework? Have you tried to find out how to calculate Good Friday in general, independent of any programming language ? __label__3 That ' s a *very* serious bug. Any chances you ' ve reported it in core . trac . wordpress . org ? __label__3 `at` should do exactly what you want. Why make things hard on yourself by insisting on a more complicated solution ? __label__3 <url> is fooling around with the Rubinstein and Horowitz articles again. Is there a way to get him banned ? __label__3 And can you see how he treated multiple people in the comments section? Or does it not show that ? __label__3 The Radical Afrocentric Historiography article is now redirecting to Afrocentrism, on the basis it seems that its a subsection of Afrocentrism. Where else would like me to put it ? __label__3 .. and why `preg _ match _ all()`? Why not just `preg _ match`?__label__3 Are these links stored in a database? How are these links generated ? __label__3 @Stefan "Return the number of steps required to reach the exit from the starting point." Does it really have to be stated with a question mark ? __label__3 While I answered your question to the best of my ability, I fear that you are going down the wrong path. Are you explicitly closing your SqlConnections in the same function that opens them ? __label__3 Are you talking about that I noticed that <url> wasn ' t in <url> even though <person> was changed to use <person> on 6 October 2010? And then did some script - assisted editing to remove <url> from a bunch of pages that had both the category and <person>?__label__3 How do you know it doesn ' t work? What if you use an absolute path instead of a relative one ? __label__3 @David it is owned by MICROSOFT . what do you expect ? __label__3 Maybe, but it won ' t be any more readable. Why do you want to ? __label__3 "* <url>: 87 / 88 Quarterfinal (winfall viktory in the second round against former leader of the <url> <url>)"? Is there a misetake ? __label__3 Oh by the way I do drugs too, so we should get along together! Friends ? __label__3 I can ' t quite figure out when you ' re auditing the Transport Phenomena course. It might help to provide more context: is *motivation* really the right word, or is it more cause - and - effect ? __label__3 PS, we are having a discussion about such a new criterion at this moment - see <url>. Rather than ignoring the policy because you think it broken, why don ' t you join in with the discussion to make it not broken ? __label__3 I ' m looking for a diff by yours where you compared administrator corruption to what happened to students during the <url>. Do you happen to know where is that diff ? __label__3 The seven - day hold is almost up. Is there any progress being made / plan for the near future ? __label__3 @Norman: I need to wrap lots of legacy API so that I can call it from lua, so a automaic way is a MUST. Do you have any other recommendation ? __label__3 if you think "Sheffer Stroke" is less common than "Logical NAND"??__label__3 Are you asking if there is some "Automatic" way to do this? Or if its possible at all ? __label__3 Your DYK hook for <url> is missing something. It says "''Frank Bancroft managed the now - defunct Major League Baseball Providence Grays..''" - maybe "''his'' now - defunct Major League Baseball ''team, the'' Providence Grays,.."?__label__3 how is google formed? how internet get serched ? __label__3 It ' s just, what becomes of <url>? Is the mention really there or not ? __label__3 I saw the exact same thing last week, and I ' ve been verified well over a year. Solar flares ? __label__3 Probably. Could you deal with this one ? __label__3 What I find confusing is the connection between the title of your question and the actual question. Can you explain ? __label__3 Please make your question more understandable. And provide an example.. What sentence is not clear for you ? __label__3 a name is all a user needs to be created? no other validations ? __label__3 Okay. But in that case, shouldn ' t the meanings "of" and "from" from some languages be removed from the article as well ? __label__3 What is that paper doing on PubMed anyway? Are there any health issues associated with building possessives ? __label__3 @Saurabh I don ' t think it is very clear. How is your group _ name related to the child content ? __label__3 On an unrelated note, the bot is listing arbitrary breaks in AfDs as separate open AfDs. Any way to prevent that from happening ? __label__3 Okay. Is that a tacit admonishment of the merger chaos created by user Lucy - marie ? __label__3 What do you mean by 'temperamental'? Exactly what is happening ? __label__3 Please add the replys as comments to the answer, this way the user gets notified of the reply. Just to make sure, both of the videos use only the baseline profile of AVC ? __label__3 This is just too confusing..how can a team be an affiliate of the NHL team but not the AHL team? Especially in a AA hockey league ? __label__3 Isn ' t the second solution not optimal? Shouldn ' t it be 128 by 224 ? __label__3 The same as you already wrote in your first example. What should the result be ? __label__3 would we not read the second example as 2 divided by negative 5? Or do negative numbers go beyond the level of mathematics intended for this exercise ? __label__3 @ZoFreX - If it can be answered in 250 characters or less (i . e. user gets whole answer from meta description) do you think the searcher would have stuck around on the site for more than two seconds? :)__label__3 Having read your Userpage, it is unclear if you ' ve ever actually ''been to'' South Africa (or Namibia for that matter) - but it is clear that you ' ve made significant contributions. So first off, thanks a lot for all your apparent great work, and if I may ask, how much time have you spent in South Africa -- purely out of interest ? __label__3 Where are you envisioning this sample content would be located to be automatically imported? I assume you are doing something more complex than just a "Settings > Import?"__label__3 "..which are not funding by the government..". Should that nor read "..which are not ''funded'' by the government.."?__label__3 You ' re back! And, am I ready for what ? __label__3 Do you have an existing Windows and Ubuntu installation? Do you just want to change the boot order ? __label__3 If your numbers fit in a 32 - bit signed int, nothing ' s going to beat a moderately - clever lookup table. How bit are your numbers really ? __label__3 The file in question was sourced from the official website of Bobby Schilling, bobby2010 . com. Does this resolve the issue ? __label__3 *"python on windows does not work"* .. and I guess you are the first one to discover that issue? How about "Why am I getting a syntax error when I try to run this Python script?"__label__3 Showing off code and showing off art or design are very different. What specifically are you looking for examples of ? __label__3 `tex - guts` is a really ugly term to use. Can we use `tex - only` or `plain - tex` instead ? __label__3 Delimiters corresponding to what? What are you trying to do ? __label__3 @mattdm: the most interesting that the writer says that he broke his kit down to items that didn ' t do the job as well, but were more inconspicuous. So, uh, I wonder if Minox is still in business ? __label__3 I think some of those "citation needed" cases are on the Oldest Britain ' s website. Are those considered "validated"?__label__3 @spinning _ plate "this will work". What do you mean by "this"?__label__3 Name ' s don ' t change.

Or do you want to do this with an application such as Photoshop ? __label__3 Sorry, let me be more clear - Is your router using 802 . 11a, 802 . 11b, 802 . 11g, 802 . 11n, or a combination? Does it broadcast at the 2 . 4GHz or 5 . 0GHz frequency ? __label__3 @lev: sorry, i didn ' t notice we are oscillating. You are asking whether $O ( n^3)$ is a lowerbound on the complexity of E . D., so this is a question on the complexity of a problem, doesn ' t this make it a [complexity](http://cstheory . stackexchange . com / tags / cc . complexity - theory / info) question ? __label__3 Hello Blix, and welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which version of Drupal are you interested ? __label__3 I see. So what should I do with this sockpuppet ? __label__3 The question is not very clear. Provide an example ? __label__3 Sometimes one sees ''Sonata ''a'' 3'', but sometimes with an accent grave, as ''Sonata ''xe0'' 3'', etc, or either apparently indiscriminately, in the various permutations of this form - ''Canon a 2'', ''Fuga a 4'', and so forth. Is one or the other correct, or does it depend on the original language - for instance Italian vs. German ? __label__3 I thought this problem (non - Latin characters being changed to ?? when people edit in certain browsers) had been fixed, but maybe there are browsers out there that don ' t support Unicode even with the fix ? __label__3 Are you limited to using a microwave? Or is that just a preference ? __label__3 Maybe, but we ' re both involved now. Do you think it ' s worth going to ANI over ? __label__3 Instead of "a gazillion errors" how about the first two? Or maybe an error that pertains to the solution file, at least ? __label__3 I have absolutely no desire to breach copyright, could you please clarify the status of images on Flickr? Do I have to get direct permission from the author or do I only obtain free images from Creative Commons ? __label__3 If you ' re not using your user page, you should try redirecting it to your talk. Or is this a statement on the futility of userpages in general ? __label__3 It seems like you are having some difficulty with understanding how we <url> and what we mean by <url>. Taking a look over those links, can you see why other editors thought your statements and concerns were out of line with our content policies ? __label__3 You need to show the declaration of Patient. Are you sure you ' re not writing pointers instead of complete strings into the file ? __label__3 In your picture, with the green wire, I see the magnetic field and the current, but where is the force pointing? And now what I am confused about is if you now coil this wire up in the picture I have attached, where are the force lines pointing ? __label__3 ''Question'' to both of you. Would it be considered canvassing to notify every participant of the AfD of the discussion at <url> and ask for their input ? __label__3 Have you posted the entire code? Have you set an `ItemCommandListener` on the `ImageItem`?__label__3 I just reverted your edits to the <url> page, because you seemed to make a number of major changes without providing an explanation for them, except the word 'Infobox' in your edit summary. Can you provide any references for the changes ? __label__3 Deletion requires some care: an administrator has to check that the prod tag has been on the article for 5 day continously, that the prod ' ed version was not the result of vandalism, that the prod reason is acceptable (possibly checking the talk page), then has to delete the article reporting this reason, possibly deleting the talk page, and finally checking the incoming links. Before starting doing this on every article in the category this adimin relies on the number of categories instead of calculating five days to today ? __label__3 Do you retrieve only exact matches? What is the sorting criteria ? __label__3 Regarding <person>, you ' ve made this a Beta - In Use template since January. Is there any hope of making it live at some point in the near future ? __label__3 is this something you actually need to do in real life (i . e. some embedded system), or an academic / interview type question ? __label__3 I ' m changing over to your Rangers idea. Any way we could get a fairly obvious link to 2006 - 07 season page on the main <url> article ? __label__3 I added a link to some pretty images to indicate what I want to get. Steve, I added (probably far too many) details to the question statement -- does that answer your questions ? __label__3 Don ' t want to be picky, I assume that 'less than 3 hours from the finish' should be more less than 250km from the end of a 600km, but am interested in how much less ? __label__3 Thanks; I was confused by the situation (indeed, I still am), so I had no idea what to do. One more question: why did you protect Highspeed ' s talk ? __label__3 Maybe better suited for SO, perhaps? At any rate what have you tried so far ? __label__3 Your bot runs awfully fast. How come there isn ' t "using AWB" in the edit summary ? __label__3 Is your username Davshul? When would you be online ? __label__3 In <url> you said that Fischer recommended a line in ''My 60 Memorable Games''. Where is that in the book ? __label__3 Are your images stored as binary or strings that are path ' s to the files on disk? Why don ' t you want to use a load of `<img />` tags wrapped in `<a/>` tags ? __label__3 Stupid question perhaps, but what do the numbers in "25 / 15 / 15" and "10 / 7 / 7" represent ? __label__3 I wasn ' t planning on it before I asked you about it. I figured, afterwards, why inquire if the template ' s really too long as it is ? __label__3 What phone are you on? Sounds like you could be using HTC ' s Contacts app, as I ' m pretty sure the stock Android Contacts app always syncs everything in the phone ' s store to GMail, and only gives you the option to save to SIM or Phone ? __label__3 @Billy: Like [this](http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 403112 / regular - expression - matching / 4034386 # 4034386).

Any feedback ? __label__3 I have never heard of the 1933 "freakish heat flash" in Coimbra, Portugal.

Was that an overzealous copy paste or is the diagram on its way? :)__label__3 @user5563 the `gam::gam` function does not support cubic spline, and I am not able to get `mgcv::gam` to do so. Could you please provide an example ? __label__3 Is this homework? What have you so far ? __label__3 @Roger, set the LocalSqlServer connection string to attach that db. Do you know how to do it ? __label__3 I understand the situation but not the question. What would you like to see different in the behavior ? __label__3 Scalebars usually measure distance, but a swimming pool might be a volume or an area. Or do you mean the length of a swimming pool ? __label__3 Hey again, more about categories - if we really need a <url>, it should be a sub - category of <url>, and then you don ' t need both categories on the same page, just the Justinian one. See ? __label__3 <url>. Draft beer ? __label__3 not sure how the table is storing the tuples or if i ' m understanding correctly, but, don ' t you already have that information? if there is a table with the tuples, say, tuple _ table with tuples (kn, gm), and you want which k element (coming from set A) maps to which g element (coming from set B) wouldn ' t a simple select on the tuple _ table do it ? __label__3 Do you want real data, or just test data (i . e. fictional)?__label__3 Still wondering and hoping. Rather not ? __label__3 Maybe a misspelling, or just having one of those brain fade days (which I suffer often). Did you mean defer or refrain in that opening line in your comment ? __label__3 While the cat ' s away, the mice will play. Am I to assume your tongue is planted firmly in cheek in not writing "domus mea est domus tua"?__label__3 The cottage cheese idea sounds great. What flavors have you tried and like ? __label__3 Can you post the start _ game code? Also why would a game belong to a card ? __label__3 Hi, I ' ve reverted the edits you made to <url> as the flags by the clubs put ' s the box totally out of sync (on explorer anyway). Can I suggest that you don ' t add these flags ? __label__3 Third, what picture then should go into the Harrison Ford infobox? Would this one (Image : Harrison Ford 1) do it ? __label__3 Are you aware that such an app requires root permissions (because it needs to access the sdcard raw without filesystem)? Therefore it will only work on rooted devices ? __label__3 This guy made a huge number of changes within minutes of creating <url>, including some annoying ones in the church categorization pages which I ' m trying to clean up. Can we deal appropriately ? __label__3 Btw, after answering I realized I wasn ' t clear about something - is this referring to Local Administrator, or e . g. Domain Admins ? __label__3 What platform? Android? iOS? Mac? PSN ? __label__3 I have a question for an audio editing expert. Do you personally know a lot about the science of waves, or do you just deal with the program Audacity ? __label__3 Your first sentence is unclear. When you say, "which might differ just slightly" are you referring to the colors or the random numbers ? __label__3 I had some problems updating images in the <url> FAC. The images are uploaded both on Wikipedia and on Wikimedia Commons under the same name .. how do I get the links on the page to connect to the Wikimedia images rather than the Wikipedia ones ? __label__3 Cool. ''(sound of ruffling wiki - pages back and forth)'' "Looking forward" on which talk page ? __label__3 Can you put here the links to do it? Please? :D__label__3 `DateTime` is not a built - in class in Java SE. Where does this type come from ? __label__3 I don ' t think I understand this question. If the sorted arrays are the index positions where the words occur, why are word1 and word2 both at index 4 and word2 and 3 at index 5 ? __label__3 @Bruce: I think you ' re reporting a quick google result, since you omit sharing features of D7 . 2, why anyone would extend D7, or why anyone owning a D7 license like me would have wanted such an extended version in 2003. Did you also find all the other versions of Delphi usually found on torrent sites ? __label__3 I don ' t understand what you mean exactly. Isn ' t that just some kind of minimum spanning tree ? __label__3 I agree, and that is something that I have believed to be the case for a few weeks now, but Coaster7 won ' t let me make any significant changes that would result as such. So has it been propsed that the material be merged ? __label__3 <url> and <url> are both accounts which have vandalised the article, and both have been created solely for vandalism. I believe they ' re one and the same; do you know an admin that can take action ? __label__3 I know you moved the section about the theme park because someone complained it did not belong in 'fandom', but i ' m not convinced that was correct. exactly what sort of people go to such a place if not fans ? __label__3 <url> is telling me that your talk page and <url> supposedly both link there, but I can ' t find them for the life of me. Any ideas ? __label__3 Is it something I can fix myself easily then? Or does it require some esoteric knowledge which Local Bike shop owners gain through years of study ? __label__3  " there is documentation too, if that ' s your style" - where can I find the docs? Is it just https://github . com / lucjon / Py - StackExchange / blob / master / README . md ?__label__3 What makes executables different from strings?

Would running a separate thread to monitor each agent and to actively flag if there were no heartbeat for ten seconds be "scalable"?__label__3 It ' s better to follow Rails conventions by placing your images in the public / images directory rather than some other location. Could you please explain why you ' re breaking convention ? __label__3 If this was your keyboard, you should know what it was connected to. What was it ? __label__3 I use UIImageJPGRepresentation (I know its PNG that you ' re using) in a separate thread quite intensively without any problem. Are you sure that the problem doesn ' t come from the imageReg that could be written in another thread ?__label__3 sir.. what is the exact time will it be deleted.. sir.. do you have any facebook account.?__label__3 Hello! Um - are you looking for me to do something about that BRFA, or actually write a bot to perform that task ? __label__3 And why do you think it is an accepted guideline?

What is the reason for giving this one use priority over all the others ? __label__3 Could you rephrase "This much days It work smoothly"? Do you mean the same stick worked some days ago ? __label__3 I am alright, though I am no <url> or Sandy. Which article is this regarding, Milner ? __label__3 I ' m still not sure what you mean. Do you mean, that there were previous interactions which that edit hints at; or that edit itself implicates you somehow ? __label__3 And NO Igor, discuss edits with ME please. Are you proposing to discard the mentorship agreement ? __label__3 I think all of the issues in one questions is not ideal here. Would it be possible to separate the issues into distinct questions ? __label__3 Yeah right, I use android AsyncTask. Does it make different ? __label__3 hi Talvi, this question is a bit too general, discussiony and "no correct answer" for what we like to see here. Can you be MUCH more specific with what you want ? __label__3 Can you enable it again manually? and if so how ? __label__3 @Kyle Cronin - can you please tell me, than the font is shown in the "Fixed width" fonts? (in the Font panel, like Monaco or Courier?)__label__3 Just checked; no such animal. How much alteration would I need to dou2014would a computer - gen silhouette be enough, or would I need to hand - draw and scan a silhouette ? __label__3 At what point is the error thrown? Are you trying something like User . find() or is it through a relationship ? __label__3 I don ' t understand the comments below arguing against this style. I think it can be quite attractive in certain designs; furthermore, to counterpoint the "what about nested lists" comment: how common are nested lists, really ? __label__3 Sorry, what? Could you be more specific please ? __label__3 Sheesh. What else did I miss in May and June ? __label__3 Who do you think will be the next president?

Can you please supply a quote ? __label__3 You don ' t - you run a callback function (like @Alex ' s answer) or something fancier like `jQuery . Deferred` (my answer). But your question is unclear - could you show us some more code ? __label__3 Judo, Taekwondo, Boxing etc.?__label__3 My concern would be that the doWork procedure will finish (going on to workComplete) while your timer is still running calling the OnTimerEvent.

Can you link to me the policy stating that minimum amount of content in an article, where it ' s not 'lacking in content,' is needed to be considered undue ? __label__3 Why are your gradients 1024x768? Have you tried making them like 16x16 or something ? __label__3 Hi.

It <url> since we last saw it; do you still subscribe to your judgment <url>?__label__3 The article <url> (written with two s) was rightly deleted as it contained almost no content (Timothy (Tim) Ferriss is the author of The 4 - Hour Workweek). I think you mean the science - fiction writer <url> (written wit one s) ?__label__3 Incidentally, the bot had to sign the message you left for me! Four tildes, right ? __label__3 This editor, blocked as a sock of <person>, is currently requesting an unblock, and appears to want your particular attention.

What language is this ? __label__3 As a side - question, how do you prevent the kefir from developing little tiny, useless curds, and instead evenly thickening into something like yogurt ? __label__3 I ' m also a bit weary of this discussion, and I ' m afraid the central argument stands. But perhaps if you wish to continue it, you ' d do a bit of the searching, and report your results ? __label__3 Where they ' ve been created, the lists of governors and military administrators for 36 Nigeria ' s states have been kept separate from the article on the state. Do you intend to merge all of them into the state articles, as you did with <url> and <url>?__label__3 Now I realize the point of the discussion on meta about SI units.

Maybe `\prime` is just the command that holds the symbol, and it ' s only intended to use for defining other commands (such as `'`)?__label__3 I see that you ' re consistantly reverting vadalism on this page, as well as me. Should we get someone to lock it for awhile ? __label__3 This means that the pic you supplied is not really appropriate any more. Are you able to provide a new one ? __label__3 Thank you for fixing your edit. But why did you make it in the first place ? __label__3 Nothing. Remember Kevin Mitnick and Bernie S.?__label__3 I am not sure a staggered array is a way to go here, what if you need to do something like `{}_3 F _ 2 \ left(\begin { matrix } a - b+1& &b+a - 1& &c+d - 1\\&d - a+1& &e+d - b - 1&\end { matrix}\middle ; z \ right)`, even if you make the the array tighter, there will still be a lot of space left.

Is the problem still the same if you don ' t run it from inside VS ? __label__3 I am having the same problem. Anyone have any other ideas ? __label__3 <url> and <url>, both created by you, seem to be mostly overlapping but are not identical.

It seems that looping does what you want in this case ? __label__3 as I said, here you can ask for *security* books. Btw, do you really mean "wireless", or did you actually mean more specifically "wifi"?__label__3 Thoughts? Preferences ? __label__3 I ' ve just had an unwarranted ticking off from User : Street Scholar because of my efforts to inform Ravi three months ago.

Am I understanding correctly ? __label__3 I guess we could but this seems like such a small subset of a problem that I ' m sure it could be solved easily enough in the database. Setting up sphinx / solr or any other indexer just seems a bit like overkill ? __label__3 I find it hard to figure what "rule" you have in mind to generate the sequence. For instance, why should (1 , 0) come before (0 , 1), or (2 , 2) before (0 , 2)?__label__3 I suppose I ' m the third member.

(<nowiki>~~</nowiki>)?__label__3 @alex gray: It ' s still not clear which you want 2>$1 or 2>&1. Did you make the typo again in your comment ? __label__3 I think I understand now, The pawls prevent the pedals from spinning around like crazy and mangling your feet ? __label__3 Given the comments <url> (saying that Ganglia also should be added to the bypass list), and the fact that there are about 10 WMF projects, wouldn ' t it be more effective if there was only a "whitelist" for adding the WMF projects (which all have a secure version), such as Wikipedia, Wikiversity, Wikinews, Wiktionary, etc? Or would there be some drawbacks in doing this ? __label__3 @GeeGoldz, will you be accepting an answer? @csl, how about that bounty ? __label__3 S . Lott: I wasn ' t aware that this is desired behaviour and not, simply, default behaviour.

What ' s not to like ? __label__3 Hi, I was looking through <url> and noticed that the Gaza article has been on hold for over five weeks.

Worth making this community wiki ? __label__3 It ' s clear that <url> isnt quite up to GA standards yet, I would like to withdraw my nomination.

And if you ' ve made more complex games, couldn ' t you simply pick up an up - to - date API reference and write a framework? ;-)__label__3 Just curious if you ' re still having this issue. I assume that having your users type https://ww . google . com / calendar doesn ' t fix the problem ? __label__3 I noticed you removed Pero Defformero from the list of folk metal bands and artists. What is the problem with this band ? __label__3 +1, but no Windows servers?

If she edits the article again, reverting your edit, can we leave it be, for the sake of tranquility ? __label__3 Soz about that then- on second thoughts it does look a little pinky, but then like you say it ' s probably the light. Can you tell I ' m not used to that much sun ? __label__3 Excuse me, but <url> seems to have slept through its normal editing period last night. Is it still working ? __label__3 an IP user changed Liam ' s Name into Reim in <url> and i havent seen anyone undo his edit. IS it the official English name ? __label__3 Also, what ' s the point on being adopted by another user? It sounds good and I ' d like to be adopted, though I ' d don ' t exactly know what I or the adopter would get out of it ? __label__3 I had to look at the source of if _ javascript() to understand how atrocious it is. There are plenty of alternative solutions for any problem if _ javascript() was trying to solve, so could you give us some specifics ? __label__3 I might be able to lend a hand, though it ' s not the most interesting article to me just as a matter of personal taste so I don ' t want to invest tons of time. What specifically do you want help with ? __label__3 I was rather puzzled by the scattering of Canada stub sub - categories through the several listings pages, and had re - top - sorted a number of them before noticing that they seem to have been ''un''top - sorted by yourself, in considerable numbers. What ' s your thinking here ? __label__3 In retrospect "in as far away as" looks ungrammatical. Shouldn ' t it just be "as far away as"?__label__3 Oops, sorry about that. Delete ? __label__3 Another thing: are <url>, <url> and <url> really "former German states"? Let ' s talk about it, shall we ? __label__3 Why 2 is not the answer? Do you need any number or the largest number or just found, not found will do ? __label__3 So I take it you live in Perth? Have you ever been to Virginia ? __label__3 Nothing messed up from where I ' m sitting. What kind of messed up ? __label__3 Agreed. Why do we even waste our time discussing afd ' s, if consensus has no bearing on the result ? __label__3 One clarification: are you looking for races to watch, or races to participate in ? __label__3 So it ' s not a copyright problem, but it still needs to be made clear that the text is copied from the source per <url>. Is there a corresponding template for Collier ' s similar to <person> where you ' re not just using it as a reference ? __label__3 Can you clarify "guy in a tube"? Like a tube raft ? __label__3 Just curious about <url> edit. Did you confuse the territory of <url> with the region of Quebec called <url>?__label__3 I dont use AWB so im doing it manually. Is that a problem ? __label__3 What about in this method: -(IBAction ) saveNewCharacter:(id ) sender , if you NSLog [[self newCharacter] firstName] what do you see?? In other words is it correct when your are inside NewCharacterViewController ??__label__3  / n tags? Do you mean line breaks (`\n`)?__label__3 Sure. Aside from the Flea and Frusciante articles, which get the most traffic ? __label__3 I have also put speedy delete tags on <url> and <url>. Was there any particular reason to move your user / user talk pages to that name, and back again ? __label__3  ( according to my talk page) that we are going to loose the image of <url> that I just added over a copyright issue. I have not had luck finding a free one, perhaps you can do better ? __label__3 172 has refused to materially defend his take on NOR in terms of any criteria in <url> even abrasively deleting a query from a newbie on the subject in his talk page. Is it possible to get some official clarification on the NOR policy before this becomes a precedent ? __label__3 @Vas - Should the index really start at 0? How do you indicate zero Event["Certificationes"]?__label__3 It ' s not really clear what you ' re asking. Do you have to implement these two functions, or are they implemented and you need to use them for something ? __label__3 Hi Josiah- I ' m a touch concerned about the entry on Ian Levine ' s bio about his comparison to the Abzorbaloff thing. Even if critics have speculated about it- is this really needed on a biographical page ? __label__3 Who plays white? In X vs. Y, is X white ? __label__3 Your function doesn ' t actually *return* anything. When you say "it just returns the matrix", what do you mean ? __label__3 That looks better. I think I ' m about done now, but old Theobald ' s still at FAC isn ' t he ? __label__3 I need to have Jerry Eckwood added to the list of Arkansas Razorback players. How do I do this ? __label__3 Those are not runtime errors, they ' re from the linker! As Richard Pennington suggests, there ' s probably a problem with the way you ' re building it under Unix -- perhaps linking against the same library twice ? __label__3 okey doke. do you need more than that ? __label__3 I always thought that even if you need an account to view the info, it was allowed to be used on Wikipedia. Like the Magazine references ? __label__3 Okay, I tagged <url> a hoax twice, but <url> has pointed out http://ww . tylershoemakerracing . com/. I can ' t remember exactly what the article said, but does it agree with the source ? __label__3 Hi Arcadian, regarding 'your' article on <url>, I think the classification as "hexose deoxy sugar" is clearly wrong, it would be rather something like "methyl ether of a branched heptose dideoxy sugar" but I ' m not sure how chemists usually refer to such substances. Could you shed light on the issure ? __label__3 Is your POST tag variable set? Is that query returning rows ? __label__3 In addition to xe1 xe2 xe3 xe0 xe7 xe9 xea xed xf3 xf4 xf5 xfa, I noticed that Portuguese uses - in the middle of words. When do you use -?__label__3 could you add some code? does your `<object>` tag have an `id`?__label__3 I see no problem with e - mail being used as a verb. If you can mail a [paper] letter, why can ' t you [e-]mail an [electronic] letter ? __label__3 Can you explain why you need a text file dump of a bunch of synonyms? Why not just use [synonym . com](http://ww . synonym . com / synonyms/) ?__label__3 @Helen Hunt: your question looks pretty similar to memory allocation / garbage collection to me. You mention worrying about fragmentation, can you "move" object around once established or not ?__label__3 Option 3 is my preferred option as well. but the recommendation suggested we go with option 2 first pending consensus on 3. Even though the mediation cabal decision is non binding shouldn ' t we just follow through with 2 and take a poll on 3 at a later date, as per the recommendation ? __label__3 I did that already, a while back. Is there another one to block ? __label__3 This question depends on what window manager you are running. Are you using Gnome, KDE, XFce, ..?__label__3 What do you mean by "expected running time"? Are you taking the expectation over some random distribution of inputs (as most of the answers seem to think), or over the distribution of random bits used by the algorithm (the usual meaning for randomized algorithms), or both ? __label__3 What documentation? Can you provide the link or an example ? __label__3 I tried to follow the directions for that but they were too confusing. Can you do it ? __label__3 Sorry, but my broadcom still needs the proprietary driver. Therefore, the questions raised as above is, when connected to the internet via cable, can you download the broadcom driver via additional driver ? __label__3 I never understood why sun / etc didn ' t implement a datespan or timespan class directly. given a Date or Timestamp class this is the first use case, isn ' t it ? __label__3 These are individual strings? Not one huge block, correct ? __label__3 The Olbermann thing is being discussed on the <url> talk page. Do you have anything to add ? __label__3 Quite unclear. Maybe `my _ hash . each{|k, v| puts k}` ?__label__3 Alright, RFC time. Can we meet on IRC ? __label__3 What do you mean by "All rows are sorted, and all columns are sorted"? for example, [1 , 4 ; 2 , 3],how is that sorted according to your precondition ? __label__3 Sorry, I meant `/usr / local / texlive / 2010 / texmf - config / web2c / updmap . cfg`, not `/usr / local / texlive / 2010 / texmf / web2c / updmap . cfg`. Is `Map uop . map` present in the former file ? __label__3 What can you say about <url>, some of them are marked as stubs. Is it correct ? __label__3 can you clarify a bit. when you said 'I thought about adding some lists about science (500 users)..' are you talking about Following a list created by another Twitter user ? __label__3 What have you tried yourself? Is it a homework / interview - question ? __label__3 A "sequence point" in C has a precise definition. Does your "(pseudo) C - like" language define sequence points in the same way ? __label__3 @Nate - Yeah, this is pretty close to that question. I ' m not up on disc brakes; anyone know if these can be merged, or is there enough difference between the two models to maintain the two Q & A threads separately ? __label__3 So basically, I ' ve come across the edit conflict warning, and I simply copy my text, and paste it to the latest version of the article. I think you are saying that people insert 'edit conflict' to show that if any continuity is broken, it is because the comment was intended for a previous version of the article ? __label__3 You are able to read it here <url>. Wondering if this is worthy of sign post ? __label__3 well, which order do you want to have? and what is the connection between keys and values, then ? __label__3 If someone has to figure out the coordinates anyway, does it take more work just to use that in Photoshop to do it manually? I mean.. someone must sift through all those photos and find those coordinates anyway, right ? __label__3 What are you doing with the XML? Reason I ask is this, instead of wrapping the XML library and exposing wrapper classes to your code, why don ' t you implement a simpler object model for what you are storing in the XML and expose that - then have a clean interface which can persist / extract that object model from the XML ? __label__3 I ain ' t seen ya around for awhile. Were ' s ya been ? __label__3 What exactly do you mean by continue with left+right? Say the original text was "abcdefgh", and your two 'words' are "cd" and "bef", would you first split into "ab"-"cd"-"efgh", and then search in "abefgh", and find "bef", and split into "a"-"bef"-"gh" and then continue with "agh", and not find anything ? __label__3 I ' m not familiar with Australian laws, but I ' d be surprised if there ' s anything there very different from similar laws elsewhere - answers would apply equally on other locales. Am I wrong about those laws ? __label__3 For the household income page, can you find a way to eliminate the <url> page and instead change it back to its original title, "List of countries by household income"? Who changed that ? __label__3 @charles fox: should it be lossless? Are the images line art or photographs ? __label__3 I disagree that it fits the description perfectly, but that aside..it doesn ' t indicate that the move is "signature" or that she has ever used it before. Can you find another source that she used the move on another occasion ? __label__3 I happened to notice this odd edit here: <url>. A weird thing for an anon IP to do ? __label__3 Any algorithm or algorithms in computational geometry? Also, is this homework ? __label__3 I ' m not sure this is practical. So much game logic uses vector math, you ' d have to either do everything in 3D before converting down to 2D or whatever for rendering, or you ' d have to completely abstract away your vector library - which would surely be impractical ? __label__3 4. Are there any signed agreement with the Anglican Church in this regard ? __label__3 My browser sometimes closes up when I come to this site. Why ? __label__3 Hi, noticed you removed categories on defunct / renamed schools. Why do you think them unnecessary ? __label__3 Where ' s the recursive call meant to happen? Is 'getContinent' meant to be 'getAllFields'?__label__3 They look like relatively normal new editor with lots of background and opinions on the Cherokee, but not much Wikipedia knowledge (yet), though it looks likely that they might be Bill John Baker. Is that what you ' re afraid of ? __label__3 Sorry, no admin powers. If serious bring to the admin noticeboard ? __label__3 I have not. What is it and how do I use it ? __label__3 If you are beccoming a target again do you want semi prot for a while? How much activity is it getting ? __label__3 Please do not make false accusations. Where did he add a cn tag to a comment by a non - believer ? __label__3 Here ' s my current warning to him: <url>, and the diff<url>, which also included adding lengthy honorifics to Barelvi scholars. Do we need to see more of a this - week pattern of POV - pushing and hate - speech, or can he be blocked for clear and consistent malicious intent ? __label__3 @Bobby: A 3 - meg file takes time to load and resize - 1 second doesn ' t seem too bad. Is there any way you can save the thumbs once they ' ve been generated, so you won ' t have to generate all of them again the next time the folder is visited ? __label__3 Why not try it out and ask for specific answers if / when you encounter problems? I don ' t know if it ' s supported, but it ' s worth trying at least right ? __label__3 Did you start the JLink remote server that talks to GDB? Did you tell GDB to connect to a remote target ? __label__3 I am not involved at all i any governmental or anti - drug organization or any pro- or anti - drug organization of any kind. If you don ' t have any claims on the sources, what is then not in line with Wikipedeia policy in the article ? __label__3 I don ' t see how you can deduce the prototype of a C function with `nm`. To have the prototype mangled in, there, you ' d have to compile the file as C++ and not as C, no ? __label__3 It seems to me that the font installation guide was set - up in a more elaborated way in previous versions. Am I missing something or confused with another document ? __label__3 I ' m confused by <url>. Why French ? __label__3 This redirect isn ' t working because the admin who locked the page slapped a template onto it, causing this link to become mundane. Can you fix this puzzling circumstance ? __label__3 Please don ' t downvote without stating your reason. Should this perhaps be turned into a wiki question ? __label__3 What servletcontainer are you using / targeting? What ' s the reason that you don ' t use 3rd party libraries for this ? __label__3 Only VideoCode returns undefined? Have you tried not using capital letters ? __label__3 What platform are you looking at? Can you use Google Maps to draw shapes ? __label__3  " remove all 0 ' s and 1 ' s". So if your int is 2107900 you want to get 279 ? __label__3 ..Bipolar? Electronic Jekyll - Hyde? :-P__label__3 @Gumbo: Since i don ' t want to take k as input, i simply called as random clustering. Is that lead to something else ? __label__3  " Office actions will be clearly indicated both during and after to prevent ambiguities." -- <url>. So then does that mean it was probably DMCA ? __label__3 What language? Could you use an existing regular expression library ? __label__3 Exactly! If I am to implement another interpreter using R, do parsing tools exist ? __label__3 I ' ve never even questioned this before, but now you mention it why is it OK for boards but not for knives ? __label__3 I ' m a whole - hearted believer in AGF, but I also feel like I have a good nose for BS.. If what they said was true (''and it showed me what HE added in 1 box, and what I added in another box.'') then the edits they made would also have appeared in the edit log by another editor right before them, right ? __label__3 Are you asking how to use csv? http://docs . python . org / library / csv . html What ' s wrong with the documentation ? __label__3 @yassale: N is large as in 10^3 or as in 10^9 ? Kilo - large or giga - large ?__label__3 After finally reaching some agreement not to declare "what Christians believe" about a controversial point, why did you just revert the beginning of the article to make such a declaration? Can we please drop the POV declaration ? __label__3 Please be a little specific - "best" differs amongst various users. What features specifically are you looking for ? __label__3 Is it easy to use the small pump? Have you noticed some differences ? __label__3 Have you tried reading the source? Or even asking Mark directly ? __label__3 Which part are you trying to debug? Content script, background page, popup ? __label__3 15 boards per hour is four minutes per board. How long does the PICkit 2 take to program your part ? __label__3 Well, the article is sourced to his official bio site (government), whereas none of the two sources you mentioned strikes me as strong. We ' ve got <url>, why not follow the article sources and keep George Petalotis ? __label__3 It turns out that the Zelda Collection you referred to in <url> didn ' t include aLttP, reportedly because the GBA remake was still being sold at that time, so that disc included NES and N64 emulation but left out SNES. Do you have another example ? __label__3 Checkuser shows the three users share an ip from time to time. How serious is the problem ? __label__3 It should work. Why do you say it doesn ' t ? __label__3 So is `$x` not set at all earlier in a . pl? Do you know what the value of `$x` and `$ENV{$x}` are before the `system()` call ? __label__3 Vaguely connected, because I don ' t feel like starting a new section. Have you seen <url>?__label__3 define 'confused'. What are you getting for Total . text ? __label__3 Just curious, how much did the leveling job cost ? __label__3 Same question as @Justian Meyer plus one of my own: what exactly must you output? A simple yes or no if one rectangle ' s edges intersect another if their length increases, or report possible intersections for each line ? __label__3 Is this homework? IF so, can you be more specific about what you don ' t understand ? __label__3 I just tried it with gcc 4 . 1 . 2 and got the expected exception. Are you sure this is the exact code you tried ? __label__3 Ok, why was it wrong??__label__3 Of that <url> I just went down and overhauled, you and two <url> <url> were the only (active) Texans I could imagine being interested in getting the ball for a <url> rolling. Interested ? __label__3 There should be a reference table summary printed to the logcat log. What ' s in it ? __label__3 Is there any reason that you redirected <url> to <url>? Did this happen as a result of a technical error or something ? __label__3 Is there a reason why you aren ' t using an object, and having fields in the object, instead of doing everything with a local variable? Is this state machine running for a long time in your main thread ? __label__3 What are you looking for regarding reliable sources? Of the above statements, what needs to be sourced outside of the manga itself ? __label__3 How can I join, by the way? And is there a Welcoming Comittee userbox ? __label__3 You ' re not developing on top of SQLite but deploying on top of PostgreSQL (i . e. Heroku), are you ? __label__3 did you mean `{:a => ["val1", "val2", ..], :b => ["valb1", "valb2", ..], ..}`?? so that the output will include, say, `:c => "valc1"`, blah blah blah ? __label__3 Is it homework? Also, in what language are you trying to implement this ? __label__3 Don ' t stop editing.

I guess I had to hurry ? __label__3 what php version are you running? can ' t you use json _ decode($json) and work with array ? __label__3 I heard he will be on <url>. Do you know what roll he will be on DSDS ? __label__3 How much is "way faster"? Have you accounted for the time difference needed to read the files in your measurements (you ' ll likely need a bigger read buffer for the 64MB files, and the larger files are more likely to be fragmented)?__label__3 Seems like this is a cooking method question. What type of appliance do you use to roast your beef and why ? __label__3 assuming you have a list of 1 million numbers, as opposed to digits, do you need to modify this list, or just see if the number input by the user is in the list? If you just to check the list but not modify it, why not compile the list into the program in sorted order and do a binary search ? __label__3 Indeed, I have the mean <url>. And what do you have ? __label__3 Are both versions being run as the same user? Whats in `$?` when it fails ? __label__3 I ' m sorry, I can ' t follow. How is that related to what I said ? __label__3  " above code is not working" isn ' t very descriptive. What happens when you try it ? __label__3 This sounds like the questioner is asking how to switch gears smoothly, and is concerned in particular with letting go of the bars? @solomongaby, can you please confirm and edit your question to be clearer ? __label__3 Can you specify the order of the layers if you make lasagne ? __label__3 Never expected to see that word pop up on Wikipedia. Did youlearn it at AFU, or has it migrated further ? __label__3 I thought we had all agreed that the lead is fine as it is. What is the sentence supposed to mean ? __label__3 About 3 , 500 hits per day at the moment, and the article is terrible. Could you lend a hand ? __label__3 I am surprise at how often legitimate unblock requests appear at <url>. Have you been watching that page ? __label__3 `rssFeed` ?

Also, what software are you using for conversion and what dSLR is it ? __label__3 I tagged it since most appears to be in Chinese, so I canu2019t understand it, but by what I can gather the user is trying to accuse the Chinese government of a cover up. I was wondering if it was true, a political attack, off topic or just needs to be translated in to English ? __label__3 I think the `[special - relativity]` tag could be dropped from this, since although the theory of Dirac fermions requires SR "behind the scenes" in order to be consistent, we ' re not talking about relativity directly. Did you have a particular reason for including the tag ? __label__3 There ' s no apparent reason for the warnings to be caused by the `\cite` commands. Can you please add the exact warning message that you are getting ? __label__3 Splash I added the info about his age dispute, the user then removed my edits, called me a liar and added a whole bunch of other deliberately negative POV edits to the article. What can I do now, can they be blocked ? __label__3 I don ' t know what page you are talking about, as this is your only edit. Did you perhaps have another account ? __label__3 Iu2019ve noticed youu2019ve been removing links in see also sections that have links elsewhere in the article. Iu2019m curious why; doesnu2019t help navigation to have a consolidated list of related articles ? __label__3 Could you elaborate on what you mean by "square ( ish)"? How squarish is "square ( ish)"?__label__3 Since Wikipedia is moving towards dual - licensing (GFDL + CC - BY - SA 3 . 0), will Wikizine be also convert to dual - licenses?

Flowing from street into the house) or is it just blocked ? __label__3 The placement of the hyphen in "Ekur - huleni" seems odd: as far as I know "rh" is one sound in Tsonga. Maybe "Eku - rhuleni"?__label__3 To quote Barak Obama: Yes We Can! Now, what have you tried and where have you failed ? __label__3 According to the Microsoft KB ( http://support . microsoft . com / kb / 974396 ) the PresentationHost . exe shouldn ' t depend on which version of IE you ' re using. Is your XBAP compiled to x86 or x64 (specifically)?__label__3 Of course it does, and the damage is irreparable too, close to that from a large scale nukular explosion. I gather you had a disagreement with your parents over this, and you want someone to prove them wrong ? __label__3 This is an [entity](http://ww . tizag . com / xmlTutorial / xmlentity . php). What do you intend when you talk about an entity ? __label__3 how do you know that Yuvan is confirmed for Striker? You indeed referring to the <url> starring Siddharth ? __label__3 I find it hard to believe one editor (even one so prolific as RickK) can have much of an effect overall. Do contributors on either side have any (non - anecdotal) evidence that suggests otherwise ? __label__3 Ah, I was confused by the fact that your tag was placed on <url>, not on <url>. Wildbot has visited, & updated the talk page again, so where is the result of the whole exercise ? __label__3 do you include libfoo . h in libfoo . cpp? If you do an `nm` on the libfoo . a do you have the c++ name for the foobar() function ? __label__3 What happens if you try other alternative keyboard?

Is now <url> ready for FAC ? __label__3 @George, I installed to fedora 12 (2 . 6 . 32 . 16 - 141 . fc12 . x86 _ 64) and my panel will not autohide now. Any ideas ? __label__3 If not here, then where? If not now, then when ? __label__3 @Peter: How about calling it the "necessary"? That ' s discreet, right ? __label__3 google? wikipedia ? __label__3 It should prepopulate from that json url. Are you sure you followed the guide ? __label__3 How does he rebut it? What can he do ? __label__3 The ''A'' is italicized. Can anyone cite something in one of the style manuals that says this shouldn ' t be done ? __label__3  " Redirecting is blanking" would be more accurate. Or maybe "redirecting is redirecting"?__label__3 Are you asking for a tool that does this? Or an idea how to do this in python ? __label__3 I think I do mark my pages patrolled. Doesn ' t Twinkle do it automatically ? __label__3 In the title you say .doc but in your question you say .pdf. Which is it ? __label__3 I have updated question. Can you please look at it ? __label__3 did you mean when you try to load application context from jar its not working ? if so error message ?__label__3 If something already exists. Why would I take the overhead of maintanance ?__label__3 what warning? and which compiler ? __label__3 I ' ve made it "more pro" by indenting with four spaces to format it as code. Does that count ? __label__3 Without information about the source and whether it ' s a free use or fair use picture it can ' t be used under the Wikipedia rules. Do you have this information ? __label__3 hi, tell us what you think <url>.??__label__3 This is not really enough to tell what can be the problem. Have you tried debug you code, for example trace something in the conditions (so the function what have to be called is called properly or not)?__label__3 Thanks again Robert! I will definitely work it out..But can you please explain about my confusion on whether it will provide normalizable or non normalizable mode (basically my first comment after your response) and in that case what will be the source that will couple to boundary operator ? __label__3 Basta colla tua grecofilia tendenzionista! Ai capito bene ? __label__3 Upon further thought, maybe I could look through lists of deleted articles to see if any interest me and see if I can bring them back (with adequate sourcing). Do you know anything about that process ? __label__3 Don ' t use the `javascript:` pseudo - protocol in inline event handler attributes; you ' re merely adding a useless JavaScript label there. Moreover, this should work as expected, what exactly does not work ? __label__3 Looks ok at first blush. I assume that <controller> and <action> are placeholders and you are really posting the proper values.. Are you then actually following up with 103 bytes of data ? __label__3 Hmm..I was not aware that a year had to pass for ''anyone'' to request an appeal for Everyking. Prior to today, when did they ever say this ? __label__3 Are the cross - sections always convex polygons? Or can they be concave ? __label__3 Isadore .. Well! you have heard of it now :-) Do none of your sources mention it, or do they contradict what Ingram noted as part of the 'Genesis' of the poem ? __label__3 Do you mean malware once installed setting up a backdoor which requires portknocking to open? I can ' t think that this questionmakes any sense otherwise ? __label__3 I ' m getting a little nervous that the FAC ' s not attracting much attention. You know FAC much better than I do, should I be worried yet ? __label__3 OK, so that works but out of interest, why? Why doesn ' t it store the number as 16 . 695 as was set ? __label__3 @Jacques: “M is the disjoint union of the level set approximations to the complement of the Mandelbrot set.” Yes, if by disjoint union you mean discriminated union (“disjoint union” sometimes means the usual union of pairwise disjoint sets, and I want to avoid this ambiguity). Have I ever suggested otherwise ? __label__3 Can you put a better dab <url>? (I can ' t decide) And since there ' s a 1996 TV series redirect, would <url> prefer a redirect like <url> over <url> on <url>?__label__3 I notice you removed within a few minutes an anecdote added anonymously about how Nik Kershaw found his manager Micky Modern, as "uncited". Google shows that the essence of the story is related by Kershaw in an interview transcribed (with typos) at http://ww . nikkershaw . it / press / interviews / 2002interview . php ? id=8 Is it not Wikipedia policy to flag such statements as uncited and allow time for a citation to be added ? __label__3 Hi, what does this mean - if I am to be a named party in the case I at least need ot understand what it is about, please explain - ""Feuding and BLPs" a case to examine meta behavioral issues and reconcile the applicable principles?? - what do you perceive this is related to ? __label__3 Noo! Can I ask why you think you ' ve lost the enthusiasm ? __label__3 If the <url> was invented in 1983, how was it featured in a 1959 film?

Is it the added realism or something ? __label__3 Are you actually wanting it to become "part of" the standard library on your system, or are you just wanting it to work in your project? To phrase it another way, what is the actual problem you have right now using the code you posted ? __label__3 I am sorry you "don ' t like <url> tone", but I have made scrupulous efforts to be entirely civil. Your opinion of my tone apart, would you care to respond to my points ? __label__3 Indeed. Why were the comments removed ? __label__3 Yes, I ' d say split it. But, where ' s the controversial opinion ? __label__3 hot flues and toxic electrical insulation are likely not compatible bed mates.

However, are you asking a question? :P__label__3 It ' s archived onto CD; I ' ll have to search it out. Suggestion on what you ' d like to see in the way of resolution ? __label__3 I have tried the default "Hello World" from a new C++ console project and it builds and runs fine, could you please provide a screenshot of the error ?

Do we have "consensus" on this yet, or is an RM required ? __label__3 Can you clarify what you ' re trying to do? Are you just trying to replace one view with another ? __label__3 I don ' t see the DOMWindow type in my Chrome. Are you sure that it ' s a type ? __label__3 what have you tried? did you look for a vb tutorial ? __label__3 @kaiser: Sorry, not meaning to be harsh. I just don ' t understand for what real world reason you would advocate just sticking to those terms ? __label__3 Also what are the screen dimensions? I . e. will the screen always be smaller than 512x512 ? __label__3 Setting to "no color" works. Area there any issues with this technique ? __label__3 Which images specifically? Did you look in the F12 Network tab or Fiddler to see if there are any networking failures ? __label__3 I don ' t understand what you mean. Are you saying I cannot link from within a ref tag ? __label__3 This question is unclear. Please clarify it (add annotated screenshots?).__label__3 I added a contains spoiler tag because I didn ' t know about any secret mission. Maybe we could use this tag for questions that contain spoilers on the side ? __label__3 The thread at <url> ground to a halt. Any way to get this implemented ? __label__3 Hi - I ' m confused. I seem to have lost the note that you say I left on your page ? __label__3 Did you install threads correctly (for. with CPAN shell)?__label__3 I alfred. What model (on your data) do you use to estimate the mean and SE ?__label__3 What do you mean with `Good Effect`? What do you have so far if you don ' t want plugins ? __label__3 @Anon.: Whats wrong with using the help of regular expressions to generate an XML ? __label__3 Interesting. Do you know a proof that those axioms are inconsistent that ' s more elementary (no transfinite induction)?__label__3 That ' s crazy. Are you using any sort of home screen replacement ? __label__3 Bah, I ' m a little rusty with compilation theory.. Do you know where the conflict is in your grammar ? __label__3 I think the error is in your index . php file (see my answer). can you pastebin the code of this file ? __label__3 You are building a xFA for the _byte_ input? Wouldn ' t it be a lot easier (and more reliable) to operate on (Utf16) chars ? __label__3 There are a few posts at <url> saying people are having trouble seeing the DYK picture that ' s up now.

I ' ve flattened out the sub - templates at <person>: what is it that isn ' t working ? __label__3 I ' ve poked around with an LP solver and the Nash equilibrium seems not to have an obvious, nice description.

Can you cite any scholars or experts who support your thesis ? __label__3 I still prefer Huxley ' s version, as I don ' t think that version makes the dying off clear, and ignores the r - type organism analogue. Is there any way to work more emphasis into the dying off part in, as it ' s absolutely crucial to the removal of unfit forms ? __label__3 Use headers like `cstdio`, not `stdio . h`, for C library headers in C++. And what ' s wrong with `std::vector`?__label__3 What would that do? Is that good ? __label__3  " For code security, I should want a language that compiles and is run in a virtual machine.": How a virtual machine is going to help with security ? __label__3 I also think it would be nice to leave the Snead article uncreated until game time. Then, as soon as he takes a snap, there can be a DYK saying something like "Did you know that <url> and ''<url>'' both took snaps in the innagural game of the <url>, the <url>?__label__3 You want to move -4 (0xfc) to al? and move 0x01 to ah ? __label__3 Hi there, I was just wondering why you edited my user page to remove the "you have old messages" banner. I agree that "you have new messages" jokes are annoying, but what ' s wrong with old ? __label__3 And what is the question? What is not working as you want it ? __label__3 I know ''shin'' is one letter in the Hebrew alphabet, but the "sh" in English is a diphtong and there should be no need to transliterate the shin to SH. Have you seen this convention in any other articles ? __label__3 Where is the question? What did you do, and what error did you get ? __label__3 I guess this could lead to another set of advertising answers. There are a good range of vendors providing high quality services in this industry, but you might want to update your question with region, country etc ? __label__3 Depends on the size. Broiler - fryer ? __label__3 Are the objects with the same name, the same objects? Or do they differ in some other property ? __label__3 Do you want the scans to be run continuously or on - demand.

Is this the Roman version of the Fibonacci sequence ? __label__3 I just checked several of the most important Russian writers and painters and was shocked to see that some very important ones (and also well - known in the Western world) are as yet not in scope of the Biographies Project (think <url>, <url>, <url>, <url>, <url> and <url>). Which raises the question, how many more important persons are not in scope ? __label__3 What about simply running Clang (or, if you want to punish the user with bad error messages, CC) from a Ruby script?

Doesn ' t that make your application seem slower than it actually is ? __label__3 Any idea whether there are triangular bags that you could use as regular bags ? __label__3 The Gestalt Prayer (and it ' s modified version missing the last line, as the article explained) is of cultural and historical importance. Why was it removed ? __label__3 You said you were promoting them, but, um.. they aren ' t listed at <url>, they still say they ' re FPOCs on their talk pages, etc, etc. Should we consider them featured or not ? __label__3 SiegeX, what do you mean? Means, instead of rows+columns, I should change it to rows only ? __label__3 My only qualm, then, is that your question seems extremely specific, as I doubt anyone will be able to give you an answer without having experienced the exact same situation. Did you try to check what http://cyri . systemrequirementslab . com / CYRI/ think of your machine ? __label__3 You had said at CFD that you were allowing some time for <url> to be listified. We ' re past that time, can the cat now be deleted ? __label__3 What sort of fruit are you using? Are you adding pectin or getting from fruit too ? __label__3 You reverted my wording changes here, pointing to the talk page, but the last comment there is my rationale for the rewording from back when I revamped it. Am I missing something ? __label__3 i ’ ll come back to you on this one. Do you have Logic (express / pro)?__label__3 Who deleted it? Would I be violating due process if I undeleted it ? __label__3 How does it feel being wikifamous??__label__3 Are you deactivating the same plugin multiple times? Or does that message comes on every plugin deactivation of multiple plugins ? __label__3 Hey, I am curious as to why you made <url> on the Blink - 182 page. Any specific reason ? __label__3 Why 1 , 2 , 4 and 2 , 4 but not 1 , 2 or 1 , 4? Why 3 and 4 but not 1 or 2 ? __label__3 What changes are you referring to??__label__3 The question seems to be ill - defined. Do you mean that you want to find min {abs ( t [ i]-t [ j]): i=/=j}?__label__3 @whuber Sorry, I can ' t see why that AmStat article is relevant. Where is the time-*dependent* exposure in the question ? __label__3 shouldn ' t it be `f` and `f+4`..Could you confirm? why the `4`?__label__3 It ' s interesting that the "alternative medicine" bit was inserted without discussion on 4 Dec. 2010, by my old friend <url>. What ' s that about ? __label__3 Agreed. Can you tell at a higher level what you ' re trying to do ? __label__3 @code: **Come on!** I have *already* made an end - user friendly site at http://stacklist . quickmediasolutions . com - can we stick to what we already have ? __label__3 Title could be a bit better. Just to be clear are you asking "What is the difference between C++ and Java on the Android Phone?"__label__3 Are you concerned with the fact that these are glass, or that they ' re shallow pans ? __label__3 Ashvini, if you cannot tell the difference between answering a question and posting a discussion, you shouldn ' t be working on software to begin with. Really, what the hell ? __label__3 This one asks about the size, thought. Slightly different ? __label__3 @bigubosu: Any chance that you ' re overwriting it later on? What is the output of `NSLog(@"testTwo %@", scoreList);`?__label__3 Have you considered a Dremel tool? Or is it not a fine enough cut ? __label__3 In that code, `zgrep` is a bareword. What *exact* code are you using to execute zgrep ? __label__3 Do you mean require a login to access them? Or do you mean prevent them from being saved out of the browser ? __label__3 What OS? Can you establish a link local IP address ? __label__3 I don ' t see you saying that you have measured the performance and found it lacking. Out of curiosity: how much slower is the extra method call, and what are you doing that is sensitive to this small slow down ? __label__3 Not sure how much the vote matters, though. Do you think this should be mentioned at the TPM talk page if the review results in a relisting ? __label__3 Where exactly are the tests? /forum / tests / tests . py, or /forum / tests . py ? __label__3 Well it looks like a basic hill - climbing problem, for which my favorite method is [Metropolis - Hastings](http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Metropolis % E2 % 80 % 93Hastings _ algorithm). What ' s all that business about patents ? __label__3 Working on it - sent an email to the people at the Cambridge U Library to see if they know where it ' s from. In the meantime, could you check with Jappalang that his concern about the infobox image has been addressed ? __label__3 May I say it this way: ''Even if the car always is known to be behind the same door,'' but if you make your decision "at random", ''even then'' your chance is 2 / 3 to have picked a goat. Okay ? __label__3 I ' m doing this all the time and it works out of the box. Could you post a minimal example ? __label__3 Near where your question says "when it reaches the it blows up", is there some text we ' re not seeing that you intended to surround in backticks (`) ? Also, did you mean to say "but it just quit the parsing there and further tags are *not* being handled"?__label__3 Your image link is broken. Can you try to find new image and link to that ? __label__3 Please elaborate. Did I give you enough info to do so ? __label__3 No, YOU mail OTRS with your translations. What do you have to lose, but the few minutes it would take to put them together with an explanation of the situation ? __label__3 You lost me J. I did the edits because I remember you telling me that repeating things that are already in the wiki - link is unneeded and / or redundant. Do you not recall that instance ? __label__3 I like this idea. Do you have that library posted, or can you please point me to a few of those photos ? __label__3 Huh.. I thought he was just overlooking the box, but you ' re right, @Tetrad, wiki is now mod - only. Seems strange, why wouldn ' t they allow users to apply it themselves ? __label__3 So the dimensions of the rectangle you ' re allowed to use is fixed and it ' s axis - aligned? And I suppose you want to minimize the number of points which are left out .. correct ? __label__3 kindly explain why did you remove my changes. The added links were quite relevant and informational, also The Vanguard Group and Hi5, why do you revert my edits ? __label__3  " a wikipedia addict.." -- Who, ''me''?!?__label__3 What does "efficient" mean here? What size data set are you most commonly expecting to work with ? __label__3 How do you make your signature all wierd the way you do? For example, you have a link to your user talk next to your name that appears as a COF album name..how ' d you do that ? __label__3 OK then. You take your time with what ever you do OK ? __label__3 Googling reveals update - grub will create a grub config file. Please forgive my ignorance, but what does this do and how will it help me ? __label__3 @Lars: Youtube and Facebook run on PHP and they most probably have more than 1500 servers. Can you enlighten us on why you do not consider Python and PHP suitable ?__label__3 Can you tell me if there are _any_ other constraints? Like a finite set of possible values ? __label__3 @NTDLS connect() might be hanging, I ' m not sure how to tell. How would I know if it ' s a firewall issue ? __label__3 why can ' t you use corporate authorship? if Deutsche Bank can claim ownership of those emails can ' t Charter 97 claim ownership of the picture ? __label__3 If it ' s a military box, how do you put the v - d - e in the corner? Or are those box types exempt ? __label__3 `my @files = \`find $my _ dir -maxdepth 2 -name *.txt\`;`.. I don ' t get the `Wanted` sub. Can ' t I just give a regex ? __label__3 @Tony: I guessed as much (do you write some of the MSdN content?), but how does it relate to the fileStream and / or responseStream and the overall solution ? __label__3 <url> <url> version, but mighty all the same. Am I wrong ? __label__3 Halfling may be another name for Hobbit, but the model for the Hobbit encouraged the creation of other Halflings. Nevertheless it is a Halfling, is it not ? __label__3 Why do you need to create static images for the pages at all? Why not re - render the PDF page as needed at the higher zoom scale ? __label__3 Hi, I ' m a big fan of Terry Teene and I want to know where he currently lives and what his address is. Can you get it for me ? __label__3 I ' m not sure if this question is really specific to PHP. Do people think the answer to this is dependent on conventions that vary substantially from language to language ? __label__3 I think part of your question is missing. Can you clarify ? __label__3 Please sign comments using four tildes, as I ' m not sure who you are..? Which article are you speaking about ? __label__3 As far as I am aware you should be able to do this. Did you receive any error message ? __label__3 This is exactly the same situation as [NIS and autofs error](http://unix . stackexchange . com / questions / 4547 / nis - and - autofs - error), down to the example user name. Do you have a problem with account association, is this homework, are you both following the same tutorial, or what ? __label__3 You cannot compress most of media data as it ' s already compressed. Why not just to buy another HDD ? __label__3 You say; ''I don ' t preview TfD before I close it each day.'' How do you then determine consensus ? __label__3 Btw, ignoring the London stations it looks like your bot has <url>. Has this happened elsewhere ? __label__3 what environment / operating system do you use? (Mac, PC, iPhone, etc?)__label__3 Cannot implicitly convert type 'object' to 'System . Web . UI . DataVisualization . Charting . SeriesChartType'. An explicit conversion exists (are you missing a cast?)__label__3 Either you don ' t understand what AJAX does / how it works or you haven ' t posted all the relevant code. Where is the global `$values` declared ? __label__3 Secondly, please show me where Maynard Smith credits this idea to Haldane. Have you read the Grafen paper ? __label__3 The template I want is the one that goes at the bottom of the article and produces a message that goes something like 'This article is a copy of the (X) article in the German wikipedia, version 21 December 2009 10 : 04.' What is that template ? __label__3 Why is it necessary for there to be no data there? Is it because you think it ' s faster that way ? __label__3 <url>. I wonder if anyone will actually suspect a conflict of interest ? __label__3 @Mr . 32: That depends. How does that 64 - bit platform implement fseek ? __label__3 How static are we talking? No database ? __label__3 Why do you mean by "release" and "delete" here? Does "delete" mean usage of `delete`, or erasing from the map ? __label__3 My picture making skills aren ' t good.. a clarification: you have rectangles. you get a point, which rectangle the point is closest to ? __label__3 Hi, Scottalter. Did you read <url> about it ? __label__3 What about (1 , 5) and (3 , 5)? Are you really finding inversions, inverted according to an incomplete order defined by the array A2 ? __label__3 How long is your commute? Over what sort of terrain? How often do you commute via bike ? __label__3 <person> is dropping OR on various talk pages, including his own and his userpage - and linking his talk page to his blog. <url> or rather blogs <url> - not run into this sort of linking before, is there any guidance about it somewhere ? __label__3 integer or float? continuous numbers ? __label__3 The better question is "why are you doing that?" :) Is this just because you are curious about this odd edge case, or are you trying to actually use this ? __label__3 It is unclear exactly what the question is. Do you want the complexity for inserting into the set + finding the median, or just finding the median within various implementations of a set ? __label__3 Were you ill for that seminar? Maybe ask your lecturer / prof ? __label__3 @alexanderpas apparently FRAPS did work. Should we merge ? __label__3 operating system? How is Bonjour installed ? __label__3 One last thought on groups claiming to be the FI - don ' t the <url>s claim to be the Fourth International? Or perhaps it ' s just *a* Fourth International ? __label__3 What operating system do you use? Windows or Mac ? __label__3 Why did you phrase the question so well in the body, but horribly in the question field? Please rephrase your question as "What video players do you recommend for Ubuntu?"__label__3 Is your problem that you don ' t know how to use your mbed to send signals, or that you don ' t know what signals to send? Or both? :)__label__3 If the set is {1 , 2 , 3} will the list be {1 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6}? In other words, can there be duplicates in the input list ? __label__3 Maybe it ' s just your CPU fan getting old. Do you have any hardware sensors for your fan enabled ? __label__3 Didn ' t get it. What is it about ? __label__3 Do you want it congee style? Do you like yours fluffy ? __label__3 Though your edit summaries say "cat" you seem to be on a mission against the word "alumni". Any reason for the purge ? __label__3 Staeckerbot has notified me five times so far about the same images - see <url> page history. Perhaps it ' s because the images in question are edit protected ? __label__3 It ' s complex enough to not be taught easily or well, if you prefer. Anyway, the question is more about "do we know about a less worst solution"?__label__3 This is working perfectly fine for me. are the contents of @SPICE _ FILES unique and are you writing anything other than ".end" ?__label__3 I couldn ' t understand what you were really asking until I read the answers; I take it that `midiIn . listPorts()` is not the part that actually "re - checks the ports", despite the name. I ' m also confused when you describe `midiIn` as a "class object"; you do understand that classes define data types, and there is a separate `midiIn` for each instance of `foo`, right ? __label__3 The article might assert that the subject is notable, but the references are too weak to back up that assertion. Can I proceed with a prod or AfD ? __label__3 I assume this is homework, yes? What have you tried so far ? __label__3 You mean sample data, such as for testing? Or fuzzing ? __label__3 Have to agree with @Aubergine here. Why not make us a place to find hints about getting through some of the levels ? __label__3 You want the chart to have a click event? Or a certain part of the chart ? __label__3 No it doesn ' t really matter too much for your 50 odd sprites. But what ' s to lose ? __label__3  ( undent) The original legend had a green bar for "claimed by India".. but I don ' t see any green areas in the map. Do you ? __label__3 Let me rephrase your question. Whats the difference between fixed function rendering and Shaders ? __label__3 actually, I found the requirement that "your proof should work with any F, not just MST or MSF" a little impossible because the weight could be any in the forest. any hint ? __label__3 do you have a definition for complexity? Do you know Big O Notation ? __label__3 Can you explain what "abandoned" means in the context of the PROD on <url>? The article was recently created, so I don ' t think that ' s the reference ? __label__3 I ' ve heard rumors of Pb - Sn solder being incompatible with certain RoHS PCB finishes. Does anyone have real data about this ? __label__3 As I suspected, user CBERLET reverted my work on the recruitment section -- he just spouts JARGON as a magic - keyword and hits his button. What am I supposed to do about this ? __label__3 Is this a practical or a theoretical question? Do you have an actual 8086 that you ' re using for this ? __label__3 isn ' t it simply hashing? what is the difference ? __label__3 I want my name to get a fancy colour. Where do i go for this ? __label__3 We will need more information. Would you please open a terminal and post the result of "sudo fdisk -l"?__label__3 It ' s not obvious to me that there is sufficient information to solve the problem. How do we know that the answer does not depend on the particular way in which the child crawls ? __label__3 Be that as it may, and not to quibble with your block, but I did some research and I ' ve found that this puppeteer does in fact exist - the Washington Post described him as a "master", for instance, and Woodcarver Online calls him a "leading puppet artist". May I ask why you decided that the creation of the article was indicative of socklike behavior ? __label__3 Google does not readily spit out anything obviously relevent on "Arthur theorem prover". Can you please give a reference ? __label__3 I suppose that there is nothing to be done about it, but Jamesd1 just buried a direct question to him, about compromise, under a long discussion about Alice Bailey ' s supposed religious views (Bailey was not a Christian) that belong on a Bailey discussion forum, not on this article ' s talk page. Does not Wikipedia have some way to resolve editing situations in which editors refuse to compromise and end the arguing ? __label__3 I would, of course, follow the advice the ER gave you! Can you please reformat this question to be less of a discussion - board - style post, so it ' s asking a single question ? __label__3 If you stay at the CGI level _any_ language can be used for web development. Anything in particular you need ? __label__3 Have you done this before Nick? How is the cost compared to a grocery store ? __label__3 kindly explain why did you remove my changes. The added links were quite relevant and informational, also The Vanguard Group and Hi5, why do you revert my edits ? __label__3 Since I have no purpose I don ' t need to use wikipedia, so can you change my username to <url> (<url>)??__label__3 How are you defining uniqueness? Whether they contain the exact same words but order doesn ' t matter ? __label__3 I found an autoblock and cleared it. Can you edit now ? __label__3 This seems to be awfully implementation - dependent.. How confident are you that none of this will change in future versions of Perl? Would it not be simpler and more robust to use objects instead of raw functions, having each object store a function and also remember the appropriate package ? __label__3 I ' m trying to figure out what he did differently from any of the other editors continually arguing (for months) about the South Ossetia War. Sure, he argues passionately for his viewpoint, but hasn ' t everyone that was involved in that article done so, including myself ? __label__3 I cannot open the BBC link, it was <url>. What if ''E''arth and ''M''oon, if upper case first letter, should the word "the" be added ? __label__3 Did you install a FULL version of Visual Studio Professional? What happens if you force open the dmp file ? __label__3 By my reckoning he has been in every episode, and thats 10 so far.. I am confused as to why you changed it from 9 to 7 ? __label__3 It ' s usually not a good idea to try and create images of text. Is it strictly necessary for you to do so ? __label__3 True, tho in reality I should have just blocked the sock tpar from the beginning. Don ' t we usually do that to force them to request unblocking on the main account ? __label__3 I don ' t think this should have been relegated to the CW junkheap. What ' s the rationale ? __label__3 what about using F10? instead of F5 and steping through to see what / where your code is terminating ? __label__3 Lists like this are a bad idea to begin with, and this one in particular has been deleted via an AfD. Why not try categories instead ? __label__3 I feel that this is essentially a duplicate of http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 360542 / plumber - programmers - vs - computer - scientists. Anyone feel differently ? __label__3 I got the same email. Isn ' t this a proxy account ? __label__3 My page now has a template of "multiple issues", but I have put in several references, and there are links to other pages. What more should I do ? __label__3 Yobot labelled <url> as a stub, though it has <person>. Perhaps that ' s a dab template Yobot doesn ' t know about ? __label__3 Yes correct. Any ideas ? __label__3 I know little about compilers. Isn ' t cygwin just a compiler ? __label__3 It looks like you are planning to build a bike as opposed to buying a complete bike. Is that correct ? __label__3 For uninitiated person like me, which one of the bikes in your photos is the MTB and which one is the CX ? __label__3 @Stephan I understand the question as referring to an univariate distribution, hence one variable with multiple observations. Am I missing something ? __label__3 How do you sort two dimensional data with quicksort? And how does this help finding the two closest points ? __label__3 Did you try it yourself? Profile it and see which one performs better ? __label__3 what is the problem with the query you used? are you trying to get all "ticks" for an industry in just one row ? __label__3 Hi, you removed links from "Microscope image processing" which I just added to resources which contain information on digital microsocopy. How to define their (ir-)relevance and justify their validity (or not) for inclusion / exclusion on this page ? __label__3 What the correct answer to your question is depends entirely on why you want to know. What are you planning to do differently for a floating point number ? __label__3 Umm, which code do you have a problem with? Could you be a little more specific with what the issue is ? __label__3 JJG, I am reading books on the issue and gathering sources. Ixb4m finishing another one today, so I touth about asking you which ones would you recoment me ? __label__3 The language here is a little ambiguous. When you say Web Application Project do you mean loading the project in Visual Studio, or are you referring to the startup time of the application in IIS on the initial hit ? __label__3 That is weird. What happens if you create Usor : Rolandus ? __label__3 mod _ perl? Plack ? __label__3 I find this answer confusing. If it is a hollandaise, how can it be made without yolk? Where do the emulsifiers come from? Could you maybe explain a bit more how it is made ? __label__3 Why are you storing the `first`/`second` iterators in another circular buffer? There could be arbitrarily many of those, why not put those into a linear container, preferably a container of pairs ? __label__3 He ' s clearly beyond the pale of Wikiquette, farther than nearly anything I ' ve seen, what with this AFD thing and the claim that you and Mkdw "blanked" the talkpage and so on; see my latest on <url> which ironically enough I posted just before he began his latest onslaught; the US edition of Entertainment Tonight used H . N. tonight - to refer to Sundance, without mentioning the Canadian context at that festival, which of course the Canadian edition which follows it ''did''..but I could only chuckle because the Hollywood machine behind Entertainment Tonight, or that show ' s writers anyway, seem to use the term to mean anywhere in the cold; not even north of the border..anyway, seems to me that Yellowsnow needs a big spanking; but which area of <url> is the right one to use ? __label__3 Is eclipse asking about missing jars or missing source folders ? Are you maven ?__label__3 Im surprised nobody has talked about Perls *Easter Eggs*. Isnt that hidden features are ? __label__3 The <url> contained a number of British Army cavalry units from formation. Does this make it an <url> division rather than a (British) Indian division ? __label__3 Please describe the attacks you want to defend from. What are you seeing ? __label__3 the heavier coin + the lighter coin is the same as a normal coin -> cannot be true, if heavier > normal > lighter have you meant heavier+lighter=2 * normal ? __label__3 And, in case I forget, it is what happens when I sign with four tildes. See ? __label__3 Is `n` fixed? I . e., do you need `n` groups regardless of whether `n - 1` groups would give you a "better" partition ? __label__3 In <url>, you said that "the template which appears only on his music sub pages". Do you regard <url> as a sub page ? __label__3 i just want to know the logic of how this can be done. or if anybody can show with simple example for this calculation ? __label__3 What kind of network interface are you talking about? eth, wireless, .. ?__label__3 Thanks, but I ' d prefer to leave my talk page open to vandalism. No harm done if it ' s on a talk page, right ? __label__3 Similar to [this question](http://english . stackexchange . com / questions / 1183 / colons - and - semi - colons). Also, can someone with sufficient rep please add the "punctuation" tag ? __label__3 In your edit you specified inorder traversal, where in your original statement of the problem you specified preorder traversal. Which is it ? __label__3 I don ' t follow. Can you address the above with regard to why it ''shouldn ' t'' be speedily deleted, as a recreation of deleted material, and as a content fork ? __label__3 What ' s the platform? Linux ? __label__3 I ' ve wondered about this, too. Can you make a display of an array of LEDs and then detect touch by using the same LEDs to sense reflected light from a finger ? __label__3 Is it a custom plugin or is it a plugin you downloaded? Couldn ' t you just create 1 ul, add all your li ' s to it, and then hide / show the li ' s accordingly ? __label__3 @Tal Galili: http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Love _ means _ never _ having _ to _ say _ you % 27re _ sorry. (My favorite is the line from *What ' s Up, Doc?*)__label__3 I reverted your changes to the section heads at <url>, because I believe that References (when the section contains nothing but book titles and page numbers) is better than Notes, and that Bibliography is the best alternative to References when that header is already in use. But I ' m keen to find out what ' s actually recommended - is there room for my preference ? __label__3 What is offensive in that question? And why is it downvoted ? __label__3 Is the program run as another user or root? Are you running as root ? __label__3 Still highly POV. Shall we put pictures of human skeletons from Auschwitz on <url>?__label__3 What is the question? What is the tag facebook - hacker - up ? __label__3 Actually I just tested it with <url>, as it is using the <person>), although it is in the title; and it seemed to work fine. Are there any other titles that currently have them that I could try it with ? __label__3 What are you trying to achieve? call ironpython functions from c#?__label__3 I personally cannot see why it is justified, well not from a quick perusal of his edit history anyway. Can you explain please ? __label__3 Is it at y=0? Did you setAutoResizingMask to UIViewAutoResizingMaskFlexibleBottomMargin ? __label__3 Guess you ' re still living in the real world ;-) Just thought you might to have a gander at <person> and note the "other routes" sections..is <url> worth it? Were there any on the Omineca or Finlay btw ? __label__3 and what if you make other browsers default i . e. in the asp . net process then ?__label__3 For the albums chart or the singles? Do you know the formats the albums were released in ? __label__3 I have an e - mail set up in wikipedia, but I normally keep it disabled. Are you online right now ? __label__3 Did you see the edit by Marrtel - <url> - to <url> ? Is that a reasonable change ?__label__3 I noticed you just removed this category from <url> and <url>. Why don ' t you think they qualify as historical films ? __label__3 Sounds fishy to me. What are they going to give you for that $75 ? __label__3 Page has been locked - as the only real place to report issues the government experiences is on the Prime Minister of the time ' s page, I find it quite simply a 'whitewash' to have the AWB / cole enquiry section on his page, there since it happened, removed a few months before the election. Your views ? __label__3 New text now in place <url>. I ' m sure you are aware of it, but I thought I ' d also point out <url>, the rather long - lasting stop - gap measure implemented until "someone comes up with a better idea, perhaps using a template" - can you think of a suitable way to tackle <url> in dates using templates ? __label__3 What is the input? And what is line 73 ? __label__3 @Chip: I [created a Trac question](http://meta . wordpress . stackexchange . com / questions / 648 / should - we - answer - questions - about - theme - reviews) to discuss whether we should answer these questions on WPSE. Could you please give your opinion too ? __label__3 I ' m sorry, but I can ' t understand what exactly you are looking for. What is your independent variable (the function), the dependent variables (the input values) and the parameters are ? __label__3 Well, I ' ll review it anyhow, and we ' ll see where we need to go. Deal ? __label__3 Before I respond, I have a question: do you have anything that might be considered a conflict of interest regarding this subject? Specifically, are you Jory Rabinovitz or a member of his immediate family or friends ? __label__3 Ah, I didn ' t have the XNA framework on that machine (because of the lack of VS I ' m guessing). Can you check for that on load ? __label__3 What have you tried? What didn ' t work ? __label__3 Out of curiosity, why do you want to group them by colour? Are you doing some theming or something ? __label__3 Distribution of Linux? Python Version ? __label__3 If it works consistently, a printonly abbreviation would make sense. But how many editors would actually see that form to catch problems should they arise ? __label__3 Those files are inaccessible by users with non - jailbroken iPhone / iPads. Do you say you want to guard against users with jailbroken iPhone / iPads ? __label__3 @rlemon: d ' oh! Let me guess only in IE ? __label__3 Well, it would depend on what the text file contains! Basically, the compression will be removal of extra spaces and line breaks, which can decrease the file size substantially, but how will you re - construct it again on the client side ? __label__3 .. is discouraged, but should redirects be created for situations like <url>? Inclusively, I believe you once told me that something like <url> should be changed per the guideline ? __label__3 3) and 4) look broken to me. Did you mix up `and` and `or`?__label__3 Have you copied your code here (good) or retyped it (not good)? Is the error on the line where newIndex is declared / assigned to ? __label__3 I don ' t get it - you say that there are two error messages popping up - that ' s what a UIAlertView is! Can you post a screenshot of the error message and add the code in your didFailWithError: to your question please ? __label__3 if your series is non stationnary, the ACF will decline very slowly, to the point of being useless (it essentially a constant). What do you mean by 'have any meaning' ?__label__3 That code looks like it ' s what I ' ve been waiting for (the second one with the l())! Sorry but in which template file do I type it in and where inside it? :-)__label__3 I ' m not quite sure how this will work. There are hundreds of different tools used in a chef ' s kitchen. Any suggestions on how to organize it ? __label__3 So how exactly do you figure out, at runtime, how to call the function that you ' ve stored in this function pointer? In particular, how are you supposed to know how many arguments to pass it ? __label__3 This IP - 188 . 50 . 98 . 153, its intention seems to be language fundamentalism, gave a level - 3 warning..Any way to protect this article so that only established users can edit it??__label__3 Looks like homework: why have you tried so far? Where are you stuck ? __label__3 But I did provide sources .. I just dont know where to find them online.. a source doesnt have to be online does it ? __label__3 Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I remember a nice theorem in one of Knuth ' s fascicles that said a boolean function is self - dual iff it can be expressed as the composition of majority functions. Has this observation been used in any algorithm for that problem ? __label__3 What is the problem here? Are you getting some unexpected results ? __label__3 While you are absolutely free to vote however you choose, FAC requires you lodge actionable objections and your objection as it stands right now is quite vague. Could you please specify it so I can take action and possibly reverse your vote ? __label__3 Aha, a ten Monitor ma swoja wlasna page do ktorej by mozna latwo linkowac? Moze by nawet mozna zrobic "mu" wlasne account ? __label__3 This sounds a bit ambitious for using the Google Maps API. At the very least, you ' re probably going to need a back - end server to run this -- what are you using ? __label__3 Why not share your library over Bonjour so she can access your music? Or is there something else you want her to do ? __label__3 Now we can see FileList, it ' s simple. Out of interest, do you really need FileList at all though, as opposed to just using `List<string>`?__label__3 Could you try clarifying your grouping rules? Also, are you only trying to get a set of pairs, or is it possible for a group to contain 3 or more b - type objects ? __label__3 Hi. This code execute ant file name build - copy . xml. Is the file already exist or created on the fly ? __label__3 Some of his categories seem rather POV to me, and it ' s rather obvious from his AfD participation that there ' s a disruptive streak afoot. Since you ' ve got a bit of knowledge in the area, do they seem like the kinds of things which should be deleted ? __label__3 On the "better performance" part of your question, what are you actually doing -- what numpy functions, what vec / array sizes, what cache size ?__label__3 and the sign _ in works with safari ? after a logout ?__label__3 He has now switched from controversially closing AfDs to controversially tagging every episode in TV series (currently ''Heroes'' and ''Star Trek'') with Notability tags. Is this user in need of a block to let him know that WP is not about making points to others based on our own personal opinions ? __label__3 doesn ' t a gaussian distribution by definition also include negative numbers, i . e. no matter how big (positive) your mean is, the left tail will always span to negative infinity ? __label__3 @Amplify91: I ' m sorry, but this is plain common sense! What is the use of an example that I can not show to anyone because it violates rights of a third party ? __label__3 Where are you executing the query? Do you get any errors ? __label__3 Do you simply want to turn single characters into a list, or do you want to tokenize the input, i . e. turn `57+23` into `["57", "+", "23"]`?__label__3 Could you post an example TeX file somewhere? Also, which editor do you use, or are you using the Terminal to run pdfLaTeX ? __label__3 Yes I am. I am in 8V, you ? __label__3 I resisted making this comment when your question first appeared, but since it ' s gone two days without an answer, I ' ve gotta ask: why? What end behavior are you trying to achieve with this ? __label__3 Gosh, I didn ' t realise it was so many. Would that include 20 batches of DYK hooks (totalling 100 total hooks)?__label__3 Clarification: Do you need a simple *Do they intersect?* answer or do you need the intersection ? __label__3 The above templated message explains pretty clearly why the image was deleted. Do you have any specific questions about this image or our policy on replaceable non - free content ? __label__3 It ' s possible he may not be an english speaker. Do you know of a french version of that warning ? __label__3 I ' ve now dealt with the RFI report. Any others while I ' m at it ? __label__3 I thought that was the style in all languages. Can you give an example of a language where the explicit numerals are not avoided ? __label__3 Okay, I asked for help at <url>, was directed to <url>. What do you want to do ? __label__3 Bike planes? Do you mean bike lanes ? __label__3 [[link](http://android . stackexchange . com / questions / 2968 / google - account - on - htc - desire - galaxy - tab)] this guy seems to be forced to fill a captcha forever and could not login using his account on a second phone. Does anyone have the same problem ? __label__3 On that topic, not every DOS game on Wikipedia has a screenshot. Do you plan on taking any yourself ? __label__3 <url>, whom you indefblocked almost a year ago, is requesting another chance and seems penitent. Have you any comments ? __label__3 What do you mean by "take off" in relation to brightness here ? Do you mean "reduce", or perhaps "measure" ?__label__3 I find the documentation for Net::HTTP pretty hard to navigate and understand compared to curl ' s manpage. Is there something wrong with trying to delegate work from a Ruby program to another unix program ? __label__3 I think the default behavior conforms to your requirement. What completion options have you set ? __label__3 I ' ll be touch and go for a few days, but hopefully I will have a stable connection again. In the mean time, I think there are a few things I need to get caught up on, yes ? __label__3 Somehow..we appear to be the only administrators updating the queues on DYK and I ' m still learning at this. How can we make the process more efficient / better ? __label__3 My edit on <url> was written by me, not copied from a forum. Out of curiousity, which forum copied my post on Wikipedia ? __label__3 The what? Can you include a link ? __label__3 Taken alone, this code won ' t compile. What are definitions for `dimensions` and its cousin `dimention` (in desperate need of a better variable name)?__label__3 Could possibly be. Have you tagged any of the non - free images for review ? __label__3 You speak about a windows application, but used asp . net in your tags. Which one is correct ?__label__3 How do I sign up to volunteer for the Missing TV encyclopedia articles project? Do I just add my name to the list of "This project is maintained by..", or something else ? __label__3 @Lorenzo - I think I ' ve heard something along the same lines in the 80s, for Fortran, COBOL, some other less known languages as well. Sorry, all still here :-) On what basis do you make these conclusions ? __label__3 Hi J. I ' m thinking it might be a bad idea to start linking all unnamed EP recordings to the EP dab page. Could turn into a very massive list, and maybe not the right use for a dab page ? __label__3 And, by the way, shouldn ' t there have to be actual copyright VIOLATIONS (not just a lack of a machine - readable tag) to delete a photograph? Or are we so concerned with making our project bot - friendly that it doesn ' t matter if we lose really great images in the process ? __label__3 See <url>: ''Also, Spirit Airlines has received approval to begin service to Chiclayo, Perxfa, but has not set a start date yet.'' If they have reveived the approval yet, isn ' t it quite sure then the service will really start in the future ? __label__3 I have now created <url> and <url>. I wonder if a similar template may be warranted for listifying (CfL)?__label__3 Also, I undid the recent move to Eris, pending some discussion. Maybe you ' d like to support / oppose the move ? __label__3 Paws__List is intended to be a _copy_ of List? not a reference or some sort of alias ? __label__3 @Jader, the title of the question and the actual question seem somewhat different. It seems to me that the title of the question should be something more like "What are the benefits of googles over glasses for cycling?"__label__3 For example, take a look at <url> and <url>. What supports this ? __label__3 Was working, so no. You ? __label__3 So ''Junanci'' means "Greeks"? In which language ? __label__3 I ' m getting a "Metronome: q = 120", but I ' ve been in touch with them and they say they ' re in the process of fixing it. it IS 120, but should it be left out until there ' s no difference ? __label__3 You know, occasionally, Momoricks will send me a note telling how one of my snarkier edit summaries made her laugh. Is that the case for the triple - misspell revert I did ? __label__3 I have applied to become an admin but no one has voted? Why is this ? __label__3 In this case, its the finite line segment. Is "line" called something else depending on if its finite or infinite ? __label__3 Is "sub edit" called as a method? ie "$thing->edit ()"?__label__3 @StrixVaria *A complete list of all German words and their meaning would be helpful.* we give him the phrases, but he wants the translation, then what? :)__label__3 Is Tomlin ''Governor & Lieutenant Governor'' concurrently? Or is it like Massachusetts, Lieutenant Governor - Acting Governor ? __label__3 Job interview? Or homework ? __label__3 So you want to be able to specify a footnote that will be attached to _every_ occurrence of a given word in your document, and will appear on every page where the word does? Should all these footnotes have different numbers ? __label__3 Thank you for flagging my attention. Have you also flagged the attention of the other editors on this article who are deleting long - standing content that they are also approaching 3R ? __label__3 Do you mean debugging YOUR jquery code? or debugging the actual jquery library ? __label__3 Major re - write now done. Can you find the other species in sections ''Antirrhinum'' and ''Orontium''?__label__3 i also need to know what are we using the stack for?? i mean the push command??__label__3  " When comparing to baseArr1, the answer should be compArr1 and when comparing to baseArr2, the answer should be compArr2." Based on what criteria ? __label__3 What do you mean with 'the orthogonal between p1 and p3'? Do you mean the diagonal of p1 and p3 (as the diagram suggests)?__label__3 What is your question? What about your sample code doesn ' t work as you want ? __label__3 Thanks for your answer, but i ' m still not sure i understand. Would it be possible for you to provide any more pseudo code please ? __label__3 @Colin why aren ' t they defined? Of course they are..or in which circumstances they aren ' t ?__label__3 I assume you mean the one that ends in .net? If a specific link appeared on this page, and then removed because whoever added it immediately realised it was a copyvio, I can see what we can salvage ? __label__3 I don ' t know, the only thing I can think of is that I changed his name to "Psycho Derek" for Wikipedia : CommonName purposes. Or he ' s in guest stars ? __label__3 You added to the Order of Victoria and Albert page that no awards were given out after the death of Queen Victoria. According to the <url> she became the tSovereign of the Order in 1952. Is this just because the order was never officially scrapped ?__label__3 Do you know if the Department of Water & Power is free of racism and discrimination? Do you know anyone in the company ? __label__3 What do you mean? How a compiler would implement them, or how to use them ? __label__3 A lot of us behind corporate firewalls won ' t be able to follow your link. Can you post a link to the actual url ? __label__3 Cleaning up under what guidelines? For example, why are you rounding metric figures up to the nearest whole meter ? __label__3 What is this regarding? OpenGL ? __label__3 Have you tried doing a whois? Can you give us a sample URL ? __label__3 It ' s a strange question. Can you rephrase it ? __label__3 @Helder This Q is a total mess -- can you please smooth it a little (like rewrite)? And maybe remove the statement form ? __label__3 It would help if you could create a scenario so I can see what you are talking about. I think this is an optimization problem, but what if you have a non - optimal solution that meets the requirements, would that be sufficient ? __label__3 Creating and improving images, or just placing them in articles / making sure they have the right copyrights / etc.?__label__3 I note that you have redirected the latter article (3 , 500+ characters, edit history back to Nov 2008, half a dozen references) to the former (650 characters, created today - by you, one reference). Is there a discussion / consensus for that move, and are you going to be incorporating much of the redirected articles content into the current one ? __label__3 That ' s correct - but we weren ' t strict about it. Why ? __label__3 @Tal Sorry, but it ' s not really clear to me what you actually mean by "predict the lower and upper predictions of y". Does it have something to do with prediction or tolerance bands ? __label__3 In this code sample, you are opening a filehandle in read (`<`) mode and then `print`'ing to it. Is that what you meant to say ? __label__3 Actually, I just joined "wiki project US supreme ct. articles." I understand what you mean, i ' m trying to play it cool w/ other editors on talk space and focus more on article writing. Did you see some of my shit ? __label__3 Could you please include the whole content of your `/etc / fstab`. Also, what ' s wrong with using the standard `/etc / fstab`, with UUIDs (that seem more robust than paths), that Ubuntu creates on an install ? __label__3 What State are you from? New Jersey ? __label__3 I am the uploader of the hubble pictures. What do I put for the author, description, and the other information ? __label__3 Dear @sb1, it ' s all great but could you please answer the main question - in non - engineering terms that often already suppose an answer without asking why - whether the energy just disappears in the form of electromagnetic waves and how much? How much do we have to try to "catch it" by surrounding the circuit ? __label__3 Doesn ' t doxygen do exactly this? Or am I mistaken ? __label__3 I can ' t find a notice on the source website saying that this image is under a creavtive commons lisence. DO you have email corespondance or something ? __label__3 I am looking to get <url> to <url> status. What do I need to include ? __label__3 All my edits to clear Lloyd George disappeared from the running count. They haven ' t been undone, is this a bug ? __label__3 CodeIgnitor is a PHP framework - not a content management system. Are you thinking of ExpressionEngine (a CMS built atop CI)?__label__3 I objected because the image is replaceable. Why can ' t someone take a picture of it and release it freely ? __label__3 You mean Properties? or the Autos / Locals / Watch window ? __label__3 For a new project, I ' d recommend either using Spring MVC, or using JSF2 and not having to deal with pure JSP. JSP like that is heading towards legacyland.. Nothing *wrong* with using it, but why would you start a new project with it with better options available now ? __label__3 I don ' t have a 5770 but I do have a 5870. Is it of any value for me to test that out for you ? __label__3 Incidentally, Jossi has admitted to having negative opinions about Golb and to "throwing oil on the fire" in that regard on another talk page. Is it entirely appropriate for him to be involved in editing this page ? __label__3 Can we hear this from Counter - revolutionary? Perhaps in conjunction with a rebuttal, rather than just a denial, of the allegations ? __label__3 Why do you not want the cookies to be there? Does it matter as long as the content isn ' t being tracked ? __label__3 I ' ve read everything again, and I still think it ' s the right decision. What I ' m confused about is if you claim that <url> does not care about capitalisation, how do you explain <url>, <url> and <url> (examples given on the talk page)?__label__3 Probably it is still integrated with your browser. What browser are you using ? __label__3 Sorry, I thought you were looking for a connected subgraph, which will necessarily be a tree, appearing in a given set of trees. Could you clarify in what aspects your problem differs from this description ? __label__3 Hmm, there was a 7th <url> - but someone deleted him from <url> after removing the Prod. Is that kocher ? __label__3 side comment: why don ' t you use the latest Eclipse? Is there any particular reason ? __label__3 That reference was not inserted by Yahoo. Which main page did you mean ? __label__3 @SKM : is your primary intent to **hide** the latent images, or to merely **combine** a number of images into a single image? Also, from your code, exactly what error are you encountering ? __label__3 I was unaware of <url> when prodding the article. However, bearing the <person> tag on <url>, is this list really usefull ? __label__3 But what are the rules? Are the players split in some groups (and playing with each other within)?__label__3 What is the frequency (i . e. is it weekly , monthly, quarterly, annual data) ?__label__3 The best thing would be to output the array in XML, json, or plist format instead of using php ' s `var _ dump()`. Is there a reason you cannot do that ? __label__3 OK, I retract this completely: the IP hopper in question should..well, I ' m biting my tongue. Have you reported them for vandalism, with their half a dozen IP addresses ? __label__3 It strikes me that you ' re not really looking for an algorithm. What inputs will you provide, and what output do you expect to have after you perform the algorithm ? __label__3 Homework.. Have you tried yourself? If so, what have you tried ? __label__3 Can you confirm that your event is firing on each window resize and not just when the window loads? Can we see you code somewhere ? __label__3 I saw you assess this with a B. What am I missing ? __label__3 A talk page is like your office desk. How does the typical office desk of a professor look like ? __label__3 I noticed that you changed the formatting for <url> slightly, putting the links to 18 - crown - 6 and en to the sentence after the chemical structure rather than in the chemical structure itself. Why is that ? __label__3 What do you want to display there? A View, a custom made page, a node, ..?__label__3 what do you mean combined? overlapping area ? __label__3 DONE. Do you think everything is now sorted so I can beep Brain Boulton ? __label__3 What articles are you currently working on improving and / or writing? Anything ? __label__3 do you want an answer to, *how do I do this with `zmv`?* or an answer to, *how can mass rename files from one extension to another?*__label__3 I don ' t know much about checksum algorithms but `&H100` looks weird. You sure you don ' t want `&HFF`?__label__3 What is the rule that determines that [J27Red , Journal ] P27 [ Red , Green] is not a set? Are you giving precedence to matches that start earlier in the string ? __label__3  " useless IDE fluff"? Is that an accurate term from a non - MS perspective ? __label__3 The funny thing is that you explained in the detail any part of the question (what you mean by integers, what comparison operators are), but what _short circuited_ mean. What is it ? __label__3 This sounds rather like homework. Could you please flag it as such if that ' s the case ? __label__3 It ' s definitely a soft question, but right on the border. Maybe CW ?__label__3 How doesn ' t it work? Does the image appear at all, or just nothing ? __label__3 so the string *can* start with "USD" and / or "$" followed by digits; optionally followed by "," or ".", followed by more digits ? __label__3  " During this update, I have the chance to turn the AI - controlled entity or make it accelerate." Did you really mean OR, or did you mean and / or ? __label__3 <url>. Do you think it has any chance ? __label__3 I ' m still wondering why nobody ever recommends `cin . get();`. Is there something wrong with it ? __label__3 I saw today (thanks for explaining to me) that you reverted twice (i wasnt even aware i changed it twice) my edit on <url>. Maybe I have totally no clue about what that edit - status is about, but isnt it true that the presentation is over, and done ? __label__3 I ' m glad you made things calculate automatically (and I trust you ' ve tested it!). Shouldn ' t we update the <url> to not show the unneeded variables, then ? __label__3  " two pigeons in a row constitute a half - wave antenna at 700 MHz" That ' s a pretty cool intersection of radio invisible waves seems - like - magic and real - life objects! On the other hand, did you perhaps just crack the secret for implementing <url>?__label__3 it might not be Windows that is doing this, but your display driver. Is it nVidia ? __label__3 You see, I expended quite some time on this, referenced it thoroughly, and thereby resolved a confusion between the medieval <url> and the text by Origen. I just don ' t understand how there can be a problem here ? __label__3 What should happen if "Some Filename" and "some _ filename" both exist in the same directory? And for non - empty directories "Some Dir" and "some _ dir" with the same parent ? __label__3 Can you detail what you ' re trying to distinguish between? I presume that you ' re asking 'Can I tell if my script was run from the command line, or from another application I didn ' t write and have no control over'?__label__3 In the fnv _ func, the type of p [ i] is char, what will happen with h after the first iteration? Was it done in purpose ? __label__3 <url>. So, when people click <url>, where do they expect to be taken ? __label__3 where I live, it gets dark at night. Do you sleep during the day ? __label__3 Just so we ' re all clear here, what exactly does that function do? What is the input, what is the output ? __label__3 it depends. Are these featured links derived from the DB or are they just arbitrary links ? __label__3 I merged the two articles into <url>. What about the other related articles ? __label__3 I don ' t really understand what you are asking. Could you try and reword your question ? __label__3 I don ' t understand how it is related with row numbers, So does Lieven ' s answer is not fully correct ? Or what do you think about Lieven ' s answer ?__label__3 I was actually going to try to make it work in Knoppix. Do you know if that works ? __label__3 First, the "best wikipedia editor", then the "august Paul". Gosh, ain ' t you blushing under that hat ? __label__3 What are the numbers <url>? Are they population figures ? __label__3 I thought I had explained it pretty clearly. What part did you disagree with ? __label__3 I notice that you ' re adding <person> to places of histrical significance, but in some cases they are not listed on the <url>. Are you trying to follow the list, or expanding it to places that perhaps should be on the list ? __label__3 It should be. What happens when you try it ? __label__3 Who inherits the chiefship of <url> now? Does ''legitimatio per subsequens matrimonium'' apply ? __label__3 Perhaps I ' m the only one seeing this, but it seems sort of vague - ish as to whether you ' re trying to address this from a client - side or server - side position. I *think* you want it addressed in the website itself (server - side) - am I correct ? __label__3 The file above does not meet the <url> so as to be copyrighted or eligible for fair use, as I had stated so on <url> when I first moved it there. What issues should be resolved ? __label__3 Hello, csloat. What is your response to my suggestion <url>?__label__3 please post the output of `ip link show`, `ip addr show`, and `netstat -rn`. When you connect to the device, what is its address ? __label__3 I suspect Explorer is just ignoring the exceptions. What happens if you try to measure one of the folders that ' s getting an exception using Explorer ? __label__3 Are your brakes not working, or just making noise? The noise is fairly common for wet disk brakes. But do they still stop you ? __label__3 In what way do the GMTV images, such as <url>, conform with the guidelines at <url>? Where is the statement on the website saying that it is a press kit, and the images can be reproduced ? __label__3 Who gives you such error? Did you compile your source using `proc` ?__label__3 Hi. Why did you blank the redirect at <url>?__label__3 seems I have done that just had my set to "false". Does that make difference ? __label__3 @belisarius: Without trying to understand it, what is it ' s complexity? And how does it compare to a solution using merge sort then simple traversal (which would be `O ( n log n)`)?__label__3 This is actually a question about recovering deleted files, it doesn ' t really make any differene that they are images. Perhaps would fit better on superuser ? __label__3 Wikipedia has a strict rule about ''not'' simultaneously filing an article in both a parent category ''and'' a subcategory of the same parent. Could you please ''not'' add <url> to a category if it ' s already in <url>, <url> or a country - specific record labels category ? __label__3 To be quite frank it doesn ' t matter that the quotes don ' t appear any other place on the internet, the point is that they violate policy by being here and you could always set up a personal website to host them where all you ' d have to worry about is fair use and not Wikipedia ' s stricter requirements. Are there more of these quote / source pages than <url>, <url> and <url>?__label__3 Could you please clarify both 'integral' and 'interesting' a bit? They ' re subjective, which is why this is appropriately CW. The molecular cooking should make the dish a more intense version of the dish, not something gimmicky, is that your point ? __label__3 Well, I ' d have to disagree with you about adding animators. If I ' m not mistaken, manga artists and comic book editors both participate in the writing of the books, so I could see their inclusion, but don ' t animators just do the artwork ? __label__3 None of this is going to answer your question, but: 1) you probably want to swap 1st and 4th lines 2) What is the purpose of tmp _ 64 _ data? 3) should the second "if" be "else if"?__label__3 You need to be more specific. What exactly do you expect your tables to do when you resize the browser window ? __label__3 First use strict and warnings. Next: Any error you can see?, Also, you open $file for read or write ? __label__3 My concern is that you are proceeding at such a rate of knots that it going to be difficult to later unpick and I can see some disagreement on this. Why not seek a consensus ? __label__3 Great. I understand why you added the ref, but it wouldn ' t hurt to just wait until it has been peer - reviewed, would it ? __label__3 Perhaps an essay could clarify this? "Be Assertive, not Aggressive", or "Act like a Professional"?__label__3 Moonriddengirl, is there a specific reason to why they want to use the crop? Is it because there ' s attribution on it ? __label__3 Did you read Q & A QA1703? http://developer . apple . com / library / ios/#qa / qa1703/_index . html % 23//apple _ ref / doc / uid / DTS40010193 it looks like you took that and decided to iterate through views instead of windows, is there a reason ? __label__3 Yeah, that poor old schlub prolly woulda been me, haha! What a game though, eh ? __label__3 Post that part (filesystem events) as a separate question. Is the output of `os . listdir()` always what you expect it to be ? __label__3 Can you show us your code? How are you calling COlorbox ? __label__3  . Net doesn ' t have a `UInt128` type. What do you want to do with the integer ? __label__3 Despite my answer, your question is too broad, if a question at all (no question mark). What I understand your question to be is how to use Google ? __label__3 Where is `$valueToUnserialize _ or _ stringMessage` coming from? What do you want to unserialize ? __label__3 While I have your attention, can you explain the source of those images of Starfleet insignia that you uploaded? Is it jewelry that you own and / or made, and scanned / took pictures of, or..?__label__3 Why not? Wouldn ' t it make more sense to build your API and your charging model such that you _encourage_ innovation ? __label__3 Are you using the Flash display stack and vector objects, or are you bitmap blitting? What sort of scenes are we talking about that are running slowly ? __label__3 Sounds like the dimmer has some type of protection circuitry that is tripping. Do you know the model number, or make / model ? __label__3 The problem you described is not to be expected in normal circumstances. Can you please add to your question a [minimal working example](http://ww . minimalbeispiel . de / mini - en . html) illustrating the odd bahaviour described ? __label__3 I ' d personally be keeping my seven million records in a database, and letting the SQL Server team worry about how to optimize memory usage. Is there some reason why that ' s not an option ? __label__3 I went through your comments. How does it look now ? __label__3 Oh, yeah, I ' ve heard of that--that was the issue the Colonel was (incorrectly) alluding to, right? Is that list to which your link sent me something that Steve had to create, or was it generated automatically ? __label__3 1) You should probably edit the original question 2) Agreed, that ' s unprofessional 3) You let recruiters IM you? Are you crazy ? __label__3 What ' s :data ( data) supposed to do? Did you mean :data ( rhs . data)?__label__3 are you sure it is not an 0606 component ( ie. Measurements of the device)?__label__3 Did you just revert back to the old article? Or did I do something wrong with the move ? __label__3 Are you running in user mode or kernel mode? Direct manipulation of the IDT is definitely not supported under Windows - what are you trying to do ? __label__3 Question: Is the purpose of the name parameter to show the name of the person as listed at the linked site, or is it to write in whatever the editor thinks he name should be shown as (i . e. damn the sources)?__label__3 What do they get? If it gives an error what ' s the error ? __label__3 ..come to think of it, this is kind of a really nitpicky question, but <url> ''does'' count as current head of the "main" Matsudaira family, right? Since it only became renamed and all but it ' s still the continuation of the same family ? __label__3 What will hapen, when you remove anything but print `print` from loop? Do you get equal files ? __label__3 Some pictures are not mine, but those that I have changed, their own. And you can submit a complaint the owners of those photos ? __label__3 See email first. Is this coming from somewhere or something particular ? __label__3 @btilly. Sounds pretty brute - force :) If that ' s your proposal, why not writing it in an answer instead of a comment ? __label__3 This looks like it could be a fantastic solution. Could you please add it as an answer to the [other question](http://gaming . stackexchange . com / questions / 5345 / mouse - and - keyboard - for - xbox - 360)?__label__3  ( ec ) Yes, I just saw that in "my" contribs". And apparently only arbcom members can close them.. Best course of action ? __label__3 Wow, I see there are many newer versions, possibly even 3 . 10 but I can ' t find a decent download link, not even on the Canon web site. Can someone help please ? __label__3 Why doesn ' t it compile? What errors are you getting ? __label__3 It ' s a sand box, a guide for future topics. It is a copyright even if not in the main namespace ? __label__3 @Patric so what about your implementation? Did you used exactly those algorithms presented in this book, without changing anything ? __label__3 I don ' t understand how you ' re getting 2 3 4 6 from that array. There are five elements from the array, shouldn ' t it be 3 3 2 4 6 ? __label__3 ADT break encapsulation and hence do not exist in OOP. What is a Vulcan in Star Wars ? __label__3 @Nikita: I ' m only seeing math . SE, SO, and meta . SO for mine, none of my other accounts' rep. When I paste in a profile URL, is it only using that site, or is it getting all associated accounts ? __label__3 I was wondering why, within your first few edits, you could participate in AfDs and RfCs, and welcome yourself. Are you a quick learner, or had you been editing anonymously for a while ? __label__3 Cubic Bezier curve ALWAYS depends on exactly 4 control points. Maybe you want to make a http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Spline_(mathematics) from several curves or something ? __label__3 Do you really mean 128GB of ram? Or 128MB ? __label__3 Their withdrawal??__label__3 As a UM Bishop he is certainly notable. What was the source of the copyvio ? __label__3 There is current discussion pertaining to this at the Women ' s History project page <url>. Would you mind not templating BLPs until a consensus has been reached ? __label__3 I see that you have made an edit to another page since posting the request for IP block exemption. Does that mean the block is no longer in force ? __label__3 I think this is a clear case of <url> . What do you think ? __label__3 Please tell us more about your prototype. Do you want to prototype a web - application or a desktop application ? __label__3 it is up on their website. Do you know how to put it on the south wales scorpions infobox thing on the wikipedia page ? __label__3 nobody ;[. What ' s the problem ? __label__3 Should I move it myself, or would you like me to walk you thru it? Have you read <url>?__label__3 @Jim: That is the declaration of the function, it is not called. Where is `printme` called ? __label__3 I ' m pretty sure there are lots of this kind of plugins out there that do the same thing. Why do you want to make yours ? __label__3 I think you ' re trying to find repeating characters at the beginning of a string, is this correct? Would you mind rephrasing your question ? __label__3 How strange - you ' re apparently credited with its creation at <url>. Do you know who did create the image, by any chance ? __label__3 Do your sources have the dates of birth and death for <url>, which I just created? And, while I ' m on the topic, any information regarding his playing career (if applicable)?__label__3 I like your hypothesis, however a more sinister option could be that they were attempting to use the tethering feature of their iPhone to take files off your network without them passing through your gateway. Although I think your hypothesis is more likely (do you work somewhere that people would go so such lengths to steal data?)__label__3 Do you mean absolutely definitely prime, or most likely prime for all practical purposes? Are these primes going to be used for security purposes, or something else ? __label__3 It may help folks zero in on your problem if you can point out which is line 77 in your source. Maybe an end - of - line comment like "//dies here"?__label__3 Do you mean.. you want to have companyA . blogspot . com appear identical to companyb . blogspot . com? Or have the email postings, etc, be synonymous ? __label__3 I don ' t remember where but I could ' ve sworn I ' d seen it on Yahoo that <url> and <url> did performances that were about the 2009 VMA incident? I found the performance for the 2010 VMA of <url> but didn ' t Kanye do one that had to do with Taylor ? __label__3 @Jake - `O ( log^2 ( n))`? But `pow ( a , n)` can be done in `O ( log n)`?__label__3 Is your interest of theoretical or practical nature? If practical, are existing tools like http://lalescu . ro / liviu / fet/ inadequate for you problem ? __label__3 Yes I think you can. Did you try creating a new gmail account and apply for a new adsense account?!__label__3 Please make your question more clear, preferably with examples. Is this a question about philosophy or about language ? __label__3 That is the standard ARBMAC (Arbitration related to some Macedonian and other Balkan countries) warning. Still interested in accepting the deal ? __label__3 Hi. Can you tell me why it ' s necessary for the article on the Greek goddess to be disambiguated, when <url> has only been designated as such for under 24 hours ? __label__3 I feel that way just from working all week, are you sure it ' s from the riding ? __label__3 Actually, a further question. Would he be known then as the ''Lord Lowther'' by virtue of the barony, for that three - year period, and not as ''Viscount Lowther''?__label__3 Is the function given the ready - made number (`1491625..`) or does it have to compute it itself? Extracting the nth digit should be easy (regardless of the base - but I assume you talk about base 10?).__label__3 Maybe this should be two questions? I didn ' t even realize until I looked at the answers, but it seems to completely change direction after "Which window manager would you suggest?"__label__3 did you miss "word1 word3 word2" and some others combinations on purpose ? edit: ie do you mean combinations in the mathematical sense (that is to say, not a permutation)?__label__3 I ' m having trouble understanding this "all the unread and not deleted private messages", because `is _ read` and `is _ deleted` fields seem to be in Recipient model instead of PrivateMessage. What makes private message deleted ? __label__3 The layout for this sample code seems incorrect: why do you have a larger gap between the second and the third columns? Shouldn ' t it be between the 3rd and 4th columns instead ? __label__3 Sorry, I ' m not sure I follow. How can I do that when I can ' t even boot into Ubuntu ? __label__3 So how do you get it working again? iisreset ? __label__3 for most arbitrary word pairs, there will be no "Kevin Bacon" path between them, and this distance will be infinite. Is that what you want ? __label__3 Something to check: click "My preferences" at the top of the screen. Under "User profile", in the "Basic information" box, what does it say in the line "Member of groups"?__label__3 How long does your regression test take to complete? Surely it should be based on this ? __label__3 Enjoyed the <url>s: the pdf is a fantastic external link! Who the hell was / is Bruce Patterson ? __label__3 I was starting bio..bio - something ' s talk page, telling him to make it an article, not a user page, and I saw that you wanted to delete it. Why ? __label__3 I agree with Deb. Is there anything else you are interested in besides city planning ? __label__3 I ' m puzzled by this <url>. Are you under the impression that I ' m active on IRC ? __label__3 @Yiannis: Sorry, I don ' t understand what you mean. Would you provide me an example ? __label__3 Yes, I ' d seen your note, but it looks as though all five of those edits were made by users other than Terra. Do you have any reason to suspect they are his sockpuppets ? __label__3 Barney Frank is a politician, Frank Barney is an artist. How could you guess what format the full name is ? __label__3 I ' m sorry, but I find your question hard to understand. Could you perhaps add a picture or an example ? __label__3 i put the file on c:\. so where can i put this file ? __label__3 Reason I suggested Wyatt ' s less powerful than his mom and aunts is because it was said on numerous occasions during the series' run that no other witch would ever be more powerful than them. You hear something else ? __label__3 What does "it doesn ' t work" means ? Do you get any kind of error (if necessary, you should try enabling error _ reporting) ?__label__3 Not a whole lot of contrast with the letters now, if you ' ve traversed the link. Maybe a green pattern is just not the right base color, if we are trying to avoid confusing with WP officialstuff ? __label__3 I don ' t see that it is necessarily bigoted to dislike certain forms of behaviour - after all, there is a group of people who practice racist behaviour. Is it bigoted to dislike them ? __label__3 Please add more information, what exactly is your problem? What have you tried ? __label__3 Are they here? Who ? __label__3 Can quotes be escaped? If so, how ? __label__3 You say that "it ' s no longer working", what have you changed? Does your `runcode2 . rb` start with `#!/usr / bin / ruby` or something similar ? __label__3 Well, don ' t everyone talk all at once now. :) Any suggestions for the article ?__label__3 I was aware of that part of <url>, but I don ' t see its relevance here. Do you say that considering the audience is an arbitrary standard ? __label__3 Just curious, how much is a bunch of fresh mint where you are ? __label__3 This question is not clear - are you talking about a system you ' re developing, that needs to store a credential client side? Or are you talking about a home user / end user PoV ? __label__3 For a start: Is it TurboPascal? Borland Pascal ? __label__3 I ' ve asked a question at <url> that you might be able to answer since you changed the redirect. Why does <url> redirect to <url> rather than <url> Surely the world ' s largest river, the world ' s largest rainforest and a huge multi national company are all equally as notable as the ancient legendary people ? __label__3 I don ' t understand the "go all the way until the end" part. Why wasn ' t 4 highlighted in the third line in your second example, and why wasn ' t 2 highlighted in the second line in the same example ? __label__3 Okay, I thought it was a mistake, but I wasn ' t sure. Do you normally eat dinner after 8 PM ? __label__3 Related answer: http://webmasters . stackexchange . com / questions / 5376 / seo - and - changeable - but - optional - urls / 5390 # 5390 Edit: If anyone is knowledgeable about this subject, I ' d also like to know how the canonical fits in when doing pagination or sorting. If the pages are showing the same content, but in different order, is it really the same page ? __label__3 Sorry, but i won ' t use a module for that task. So you have no idea about this ? __label__3 the title is a bit awkward, I had no idea what the Q was about before reading it. Perhaps "great GIS, maps & cartography quotes"?__label__3 Bearing in mind your comments there, if you are doing JA in AE, is it worth getting up a collection to make you change your mind? The arguments on MW are nothing compared to what JA would produce, surely ? __label__3 She did so in Switzerland. What makes you think a photo that was deemed not to be a "work" in Switzerland was not a work in the U . S., where the threshold of originality is much lower ? __label__3 @Macha I also upgraded to Ubuntu 10, and it still works for me. What terminal ? __label__3 You ' ll have to be much more specific. How are you escaping the text before entering it into the database ? __label__3 I would have explained a problem which could have solved with the help of Versioning and then would have explained what versioning is all about. you did the same and yet they do not understand ? __label__3 I guess it ' s kind of an obvious suggestion, but.. Have you tried kohlrabi ? __label__3 It ' s not clear what you ' re trying to do. Are you getting the input as a string using `raw _ input()` or something similar ? __label__3 OK then. You would support me if I removed ''ALL'' unreferenced material in Wikipedia ? __label__3 To properly address the symptom, we need some information. Do you mind following https://wiki . ubuntu . com / Audio / AlsaInfo, please ? __label__3 for whatever reason adding a ~/.irbrc like most people are suggesting isn ' t working for me. any other tips ? __label__3 Do you *just* want to extract columns 36 - 60? If so what does `O / CR` have to do with it ? __label__3 I thought you admitted that breaking down by decade can be going too far in some cases. Are you telling me that five films cannot be presented in a single row ? __label__3 ARSBot seems to not be working? Can it be turned back on ? __label__3 Just out of interest, is it now considered acceptable to utilize "utilize" instead of using "use" as in the question above? Or should I stop worrying about this ? __label__3 Just to clarify, is this a 20ft span with two 10ft beams, and a post in the middle that will support the ends of the two 10ft beams? If so, why not just make a 20ft beam ? __label__3 Seems strange to me that you ' d include no less than five tags, and yet not select one that indicate the language you ' re using. Is that some sort of Pascal ? __label__3 I found that you have participated in the last <url> concerning the use of flag icons, but I wonder why it appears that the talk reached to an end without a real guideline or consensus. Would you consider restarting a guideline proposal which indicates when these tiny flags should be used (or at least when they should not be)?__label__3 Right, I was demonstrating that one could merge <person> with <person>, that option would not appear on players that were not Dual players. Did anything actually break ? __label__3 You do `SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE id _ products=13 AND name="audio" AND value="2 . 1" AND name="hdd" AND value="200 gb"` but that won ' t return anything because there is no row that has all these values. Are you looking for OR instead of AND ? __label__3 Heap with linked list of records + balanced binary tree keyed on priority pointing to corresponding linked list won ' t work? What am I missing ? __label__3 Senta . jpg was garbled or empty or some such, so I deleted it. You might want to try re - uploading ? __label__3 Can you specify "sometimes"? When does it work and when not ? __label__3 I gave user <url> an official 3RR. Is there anything that can be done about this ?__label__3 I don ' t understand. If you choose S' = {r} where r is the root, then \sigma ( r) = V. Do you mean sigma ( s) to be all the elements less than or equal to r and greater than or equal to s (where less and greater are the lattice partial order)?__label__3 What exactly have you tested? You tested for the value you expect, I understand ? __label__3 @Matt Sorry about the edit, maan. Out of curiosity, why don ' t you want the spoiler block ? __label__3 Sorry, the question was not 'Is this correct, or what is correct?' it was 'Why does this work?'__label__3 So, you have duplicated records in the database, right? Also, why do you need `insertable=false, updatable=false` in join column ? __label__3 @user3266: Sorry if this is obvious, but how do one permute the order of the interior vertices and construct another valid Hamiltonian path? Or, only if such property exists then you put it into the equivalence class ? __label__3 the use of low level code does not guarantee that there will be no failure in its execution, so the validation tests should always be made. Your implementation does not have any report of failure ? __label__3 Whoops. How about now ? __label__3 What user list? The one I linked to ? __label__3 Ok, so you have successfully logged in??__label__3 There ' s a lot of **not* Mac OS X specific** answers, which is a requirement outlined in the question. Should the answers be revisited or the question edited ? __label__3 Hai nonsenz, Very thanks for your help and I want to restrict the "filedepot" module uploading file sizes basing on registered users. Please help me how to do ? __label__3 just wondering how the chapters were going. you think they are notable enough to have their own article ? __label__3 what does allowed? do or return ? __label__3 I can understand wanting to use less than O ( n) space, but O ( n) time seems odd, since you need to do something about n characters individually. Do you mean less than O ( n) time once the stream is stopped ? __label__3 Amusingly, the link to NACHA format you provide is to a tool that, apparently, can be used for the task you need to do. Have you tried it ? __label__3 I will have to hunt out my albums and take a look. Do you mean something like a photographer ' s credit ? __label__3 What are your requirements? Is LALR ( 1) not sufficient for you, and if so, in what ways ? __label__3 Equal area or equal size (i . e. similar width and height)?__label__3 There ' s a problem when you need to loop? Can you be a bit more specific about that ? __label__3 why is the profile a different model from the user? wouldn ' t all the profile attributes be for the user ? __label__3 RS422 / 485 do not have a clock, they ' re asynchronous. So.. what ? __label__3 Anon keeps reverting back. what should we do ? __label__3 Is there a reason why they have to be PDF? Can you not just create an image file for download ? __label__3 using Win32::API is not a goal in itself; you are trying to do *something* with the Win32::API. What is your ultimate goal ? __label__3 Also, the aim "using the minimum number of examiners for the minimum amount of time" is not too clear. How many examiners are you willing to add to subtract a unit of time ? __label__3 Can ' t confirm what <url>, because it isn ' t clarified in <url>. Thoughts ? __label__3 What kind of reporting? What exactly are you trying to do ? __label__3  " Generates" from what kind of data? Can you show an example ? __label__3 Maybe gae ' s setup works up on django ' s or parallel. But what is the final uri for an image which is located to http://localhost : 8080 / templates / images / background . jpg ?__label__3 I ' ve compiled with TeX Live 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 / pretest and had no errors. Would you please add the list of file that you obtain by adding `\listfiles` at the start of the input ? __label__3 I ' ve seen one on Nick . com .. I think. Or maybe Nick Arcade ? __label__3 Yes, but the project targets .NET Framework 3 . 5 Client Profile. Shouldn ' t the compiler throw an error if the client profile doesn ' t contain that method ? __label__3 Is this a fresh install? Have you tried running a fresh install ? __label__3 right but in this case, the certain artist goes by a different name now, so people would most likely type in ''"diddy"'' instead of the other old one. like if somebody changes their name or alias, and people wont know where theyre listed in ? __label__3 @Sunil: and what does you input look like? What ' s the contents of cb . Text ? __label__3 Hello Theraic, I did not start talking about your IP address I have no idea how people do that and did think it is NOT necessary anyway your obviously have a good point of view. I think you must have mixed up my words with those of HeartofDog ? __label__3 In the Catalan Wikipedia we have more than 60 wrong pages that we want to delete but nobody can do it. Where I have to request the permition ? __label__3 Have you tried any other applications that use libsvga? Also, "EGA driver" sounds a bit suspicious, have you tried using other modes than 'default'?__label__3 One oddity is that the Library of Congress isn ' t officially the U . S. national library; there are only national libraries in Medicine and Agriculture. Do you compare specialized libraries ? __label__3 Did you read the documentation *at all*? e . g. http://perldoc . perl . org / perreftut . html ? __label__3 Is there a reason the "pretty much dead" line has been removed from the <url> article? Any objections to my readding it ? __label__3 http://ww . youtube . com / watch ? v=l9lk0B1p3k0 Yamaguchi Japan -Candidate Site for the <url>. Time for an article ? __label__3 Harmless for them? Or harmless for you when they come find their revenge ? __label__3 Sorry, I have to ask: is Taxonomy module enabled ? __label__3 Do you have "remember me" set in IE? If not are you using the login link ? __label__3 Do you mean you only want the alternate caps inside of `"` delimited portions of your string, e . g. output should be `hello "HoW ArE YoU DoInG?"`.__label__3 Could you show more context? Where is `$form` coming from ? __label__3 Just so I understand correctly the censoring issue: When you dilute a sample the concentration of a compound falls so low that the test instrument can fail to detect its presence. Is that an accurate re - phrasing of the censoring problem ? __label__3 Can you restate the question? Do you want to display future events on the system calendar, or do you want to get the future events from the system calendar and display them somehow ? __label__3 @Kara: Perhaps rephrase the question: Is it OK to listen to music while cycling? When I first saw the title I thought it might be something like "What types of music do you listen to while cycling?"__label__3 About your last edit to <url>. Do you have a source ? __label__3 Did you try it? Did you encounter any errors ? __label__3 Could you try to render a case - use of the jussive mood from another language into english? As in, how would you use the imperative to command he / she / it / them separately from the second person ? __label__3 Compression is highly dependent on the source data. Since you say your matrices are "small sizes", why not post one ? __label__3 You sure? Are you in my chinese class as well ? __label__3 Array . binarySearch requires your array to be sorted in advance. Is it ? __label__3 You use the abbreviation WPMOS on your request on the Graphic Map Lab <url>. What does it mean ? __label__3 Fair enough, although the point that the Department serves a sizable population - since some cities may only have inhabitants in the hundreds - should be noted somewhere in the article. Perhaps when someone expands it, sometime in the future ? __label__3 This is a very confusing question! How are you compiling your C programs ? __label__3 I supose it would be cool to avoid using same person in different nationality infoboxes for the simple reason that for non - involved people may seem confusing. However, it does sem that we canxb4t treat this matter as sportspeople contracts ("''If you have a contract with one team, you canxb4t play for another''.") so if really necessary, the exceptions of having the same person in more infoboxes can happend.. right ? __label__3 Hello; I tried to visit the page for <url> today after learning of it elsewhere and being pointed here by google, and found it deleted. I viewed the entry for deletion linked to from the page and you stated at the top that the result of the discussion was 'keep' -- how come, then, it is now deleted ? __label__3 I don ' t quite understand the problem. If your code works, won ' t it fire both when the browser is resized the first time, *and* when the browser is size back to its original size ? __label__3 I don ' t see the references anywhere. Do you mean the "glimcher website" and "official website" links ? __label__3 What does scomposition mean? Do you mean "decomposition"?__label__3 This is a pretty fundamental difference. Are you sure you know what `this` is and what local variables are ? __label__3 and @pavium, if I just have to convert what I ' ve got, do you know how I could do it in Ruby code? regex ? __label__3 Brownout (or, conversely, surges) could be possibilities, but you ' d need to take some measurements before an EE can really make any comments. Do you have a logging DMM ? __label__3 community wiki? there isn ' t one right answer ? __label__3 Ok, now you got me. Where do I get the stack trace ? __label__3 @Chubsdad - my point was that there is a very small amount of memory being allocated above. Even if we were using a non - throwing version of `new`, what ' s the likelihood of `new` failing to allocate the insignificant amount of memory in that program ? __label__3 First time I hear about this, can you please supply more information - I ' m curies how this thing works. You mean my CPU has a GPU inside of it ? __label__3 Why ' re you referring to Jon Skeet as 'it'? Are you alleging he ' s not human? :)__label__3 You error seems to have something to do to with the function ' s invocation. Can you tell us where is line 26 ? __label__3 Dupe of http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 132319 / storing - objects - for - locating - by - xy - coordinates # 132393. Any reason to keep this version open ? __label__3 Hello. Who are you, and when are we to have met or communicated in the past ? __label__3 What do you mean by "deferred" and "fetch later"? Could you please give some examples ? __label__3 Or for example mention what stat package you are using ? (R, SAS, SPSS, etx ?)__label__3 Update is four hours late. Any chance you could post it ? __label__3 I have a question for you. How do you deal with an editor, who ' s soul mission is to undo ALL <url> across a vast number of articles ? __label__3 Is a toaster oven apt for heating a pizza stone? (sorry, no experiences with t . o. here) How long does it take to get enough temp ? __label__3 When you say 'it fails' what happens? Does it truncate the field or fail to insert, and if it fails what is the relevant error message ? __label__3 @Markos Fragkakis Can you show your Seam component and your page ? ear or war ?__label__3 Hey, I think it broke again; the link doesn ' t show on [so]. Can you check ? __label__3 Maybe a filesystem issue ? I mean no free space, security issue ?__label__3 @Rory ah, but you ' re still talking about general usage scenarios. What about the specific use case - connected to the Internet, but no outgoing connections except to Windows Update ? __label__3 Are you using two sockets with the same port? If so, what is the reason ? __label__3 Yes, it works. But if I write \path instead of \draw it doesn ' t work, could you tell me the difference between them, please ? __label__3 There used to be a Flash version made by Sega themselves. Where did that go ? __label__3 I noticed you delinked 1993 in the MGM Grand Las Vegas article <url>. What is MoS ? __label__3 I don ' t understand how do you get from "display water usage" to "linux". Can you please elaborate a bit more ? __label__3 Still fuzzy. :) Could you please rephrase - what does `twenty ten shows` and `new one shows the html template` mean ? __label__3 Getting error - when? While compiling, linking, running ? __label__3 <url>. I don ' t know the guy, doesn ' t look very notable, but I feel this strange kinship..old..undervalued..metal..can you save him ? __label__3 Have you considered using bitwise operators instead of floating - point math routines? You do realize that floating - point is subject to rounding errors, which might explain why you ' re getting 99 instead of 100 ? __label__3 I don ' t understand your question. Can you clarify ? __label__3 That is a forum, not a <url>. Do you have any other sources ? __label__3 At least he keeps the same account, some users manage to get into an edit war, find their own way to WP : 3RR, and edit their monobook --all on their first day! It ' s enough to make a person wonder, what did your block log look like before you used the SomUsr account ? __label__3 Many people have mentioned this mythical facillity - I ' ve never found it, and assumed it was only available to sysops, which I am not. Is this the case ? __label__3 By "doesn ' t work" do you mean that you left off the `self.` that would make the various values part of the object? Can you provide any error message or traceback ? __label__3 <url> It would be better if the content was not quite so pejorative. Perhaps a rewording ? __label__3 Thanks for starting my page for me, that was very sweet of you. ^_^ But is editing my user page the same thing as editing a gaming article ? __label__3 Parsley is very easy to grow. Could you buy some seeds and put them in a windowsill pot ? __label__3 Fair enough I didn ' t notice that the question was over a year old.. O . K do you even remember what you meant by according to 'my profiler'? What profiler are you using ? __label__3 Speaking of GregU ' s script, something in your script seems to be messing up the former. Do you know what it is ? __label__3 <url>? Do the guidelines disapprove of these kinds of dabs ? __label__3 Were you aware this guys was publishing private phone numbers? Even though it ' s an IP, do you think something longer than 31 hours is warranted ? __label__3 Regarding <url> I ' m not aware of disagreeing with you about a lot of stuff. What are you referring to ? __label__3 The founding date for <url> doesn ' t make sense. Which one should we use ? __label__3  " Which other interesting things are there to count.." isn ' t that the actual question? Maybe adjust the title ? __label__3 Am I missing something, or what specifically are you coding this in? JavaScript ? __label__3 What do you mean by no page opening, do you get an error or a blank page? If there ' s an error, what is it, if it ' s blank, are you sure your view is producing markup ? __label__4 Why, precisely? And what separates the etiquette of your area of society from our "conventional etiquette" speed - developed on the Internet ? __label__4 The answer is "one citation per city". Information must always be verifiable; without verifiable sources for say, Unna, how exactly are we to tell that the article is accurate ? __label__4 The admin says he thinks it should be renamed, but someone else is trying to pull the "but it happened in the same area nonsense". Was I clear enough in explaining where the pictures are listed ? __label__4 Thanks; I expected a decline, despite my extensive comments at <url>. As there is nothing more to this article than listings of bylines in non - notable publications, minor book acknowledgments, uncredited movie extra roles, blog comments, paid directory listings, and unsubstantiated claims about wildly over - the - top PR accomplishments, what exactly do you consider to be the examples of "credible notability"?__label__4 Are you running the latest update (10 . 5 . 8 or 10 . 6 . 5?). Is 'bluetooth devices can wake up' enabled ? __label__4 What error? What exactly is not working ? __label__4 It ' s placed outside of the article body, not "randomly put in the code". Why such shuffling is a "proper CHECKWIKKI task" and why does it warrant saving an edit ? __label__4 Im assuming that you need an exact solution. Thats the case, right ? __label__4 you need a copy, you say.. by that you mean a translation, or one which has been reconstructed to meet en. wiki coding ? __label__4 I wasn ' t aware my statement was supposed to cause worry. Is there something I ' m missing ? __label__4 Preferably, we don ' t do peoples homework here at SO. But BTW - What ' s the </FORM>-tag doing in front of the javascript function ? __label__4 With 6 rows you will end up with ids 1 - 5 having value 166 and id 6 with value 170. Sure you want that ? __label__4 I ' m not sure what you mean? Add my interests ? __label__4 I think you *might* be slightly pushing the edge of gamedev, though I hope you find your answer. You may want to try the gaming stackexchange ? __label__4 If you know how to get the bits into a string, then do that, and get the first five of them using a substring. Which part do you need help with ? __label__4 How about Guant who plays Pansy? Or Richard Fish who played Bill Weasley, and the actor who played Charlie Weasley in POA ? __label__4 I think you mean "remote" debugging. That being said, have you tried to turn off remote debugging for the SWF you don ' t want to allow debugging on ? __label__4 BS of course you can. And I have tried Firebug..same fustration..cant get it to work either..want to teach me how to use it??__label__4 Sorry, but i do not find "double torpedo tunnels" to be very good. Can you come up with something better ? __label__4 I ' m not sure I understand your question. Can you put the first sentence into a complete sentence ? __label__4 Do you really need to do it using web application ? __label__4 Sorry did not understand are you saying that Shotwell only works for Photo print sizes? If yes does this include the Custom option in the bottom of the list ? __label__4 Thanks, but why specifically? Because I know the difference between ''hale'' and ''hail''?__label__4 Is this the exact question? If not can you please post it exactly, word for word ? __label__4 Hmm..it appears to be an infobox at the moment and lacking in any content other than that. Have you done a search for the battle at all ? __label__4 maybe you can start with useing code tags. and i don ' t see how the frame loads the pics ? __label__4 I installed it using pacman, but it still shows the error. It ' s written "Please install the build.." so do I also need to build it, or do I just need to reboot ? __label__4 What do you mean by "URL", exactly? This is a rather artificial concept with classpath resources - what would you do with that URL ? __label__4 Testing, testing, 1 , 2, 3, are you still alive? Where are you ? __label__4 Can you give me a link to "We Are Defiance" ? And what do you mean by "remove" : 1) moving to the main space or 2) deleting the article ?__label__4 Uploaded where? With what ? __label__4 A hash? You mean a hash trie ? __label__4 Hmm, that ' s what I get too: |O - E|/sqrt ( E) = |17 - 16 . 5|/16 . 5 = 0 . 123. Can you add a link to the paper if it ' s available on the web ? __label__4 Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known ? __label__4 Technically, Taku is within his rights to change things to conform to an existing standard, but it ' s not very politic of him to do so; if we decide to change, then it ' s still more meaningless work to change everything once again. Unfortunately, it ' s all too common for editors to edit first and talk second, eh ? __label__4 Link? Is this homework ? __label__4 This is just the "name hiding" issue. Why can ' t you just use the `using A::foo` clause ?__label__4 When I look at your grammar at line 264, you define the syntax for an object.. but you don ' t appear to create a tree for object subexpression. What do expect the primary _ expression rule to do when it encounters an object and tries to set $$ to what I am guess ing is <junk>?__label__4 If it ' s TRUE white noise (static) it ' s at all frequencies equally and unfilteranle. What kind of noise is it really ? __label__4 Indeed.. The trolls just keep coming. Are you aware of content of the <url>?__label__4 @Alexander I did not understand your last comment. Why can ' t you store positions ? __label__4 I tagged the most recent article. Aren ' t there guidelines for public history in your state ? __label__4 Truly Kafkaesque. Did GoRight try to have it taken down ? __label__4 We need a visual of some kind. How ' s the state of your right - brain today ? __label__4 Polynomial of what? Number of points defining the space ? __label__4 He ' s still got the youtube link on there even after your reversion. How does once vs. 25 times or so make any difference ? __label__4 You seemed, to me, to be addressing all of us who were opposed to your merger. Do you know a different meaning for "oddwater" other than "urine"?__label__4 if i ' m not mistaken, this goes on the front, right ? __label__4 If there was another film that had the same title and wasn ' t disambiguated on the 1961 film ' s page or the short story ' s page, then I cannot be held responsible. How was I to know that there was another film ? __label__4 Why is your code stored in a `.cpp` (C++) file, while the question is about C? So, what is it C++ or C ? __label__4 Done. Does Adam Hunter need your disambig - style touch ? __label__4 Why would you use a genetic algorithm for this? What ' s wrong with an ordinary one ? __label__4 Are u the guy on TV Forum using the same name??__label__4 ..just vandalized my page again. What level warning is appropriate ? __label__4 Golf? Obfuscation ? __label__4 So currently, you ' re on 3 . 1 . 2, correct? When you downgraded, did you use a stock firmware, or did you just put the redsn0w image on there right away ? __label__4 Don ' t you think it ' s taken too far back to be of any use? Do we have any alternatives ? __label__4 Are you the owner of hacktolive . org? If not, what ' s your relationship to it ? __label__4 Hardly. Does the <url> exercise executive control over Northern Ireland ? __label__4 Yes, I posted a link to the history. I was asking / thinking where you stepped into the discussion and if you were editing as an IP and that would put a different slant on your 3rr warning to Bbb23?, have you been recently editing the article was the simple question ? __label__4  " best" according to what Goal? What are you trying to minimize or maximize ? __label__4 Looks like you ' ve installed vmware. Did you try to disable / uninstall vmware ? __label__4 The last sentence makes me think that there is a bigger picture. What is it that you are really trying to do ? __label__4 What GUI framework? What OS ? __label__4 Give us more code. What it `$res`?__label__4 I never understand why people get annoyed at Python ' s required indenting. I *hope* you were going to indent your code anyway, right ? __label__4 What do you mean with "deleted quicksilver" ? Did you just put it in the Trash ?__label__4 Eight Days of Malaise, What is your favorite whois application and why ? __label__4 No idea what feature you refer to (don ' t think it is something native), please elaborate? Also self - hosted WordPress or wordpress . com blog ? __label__4 You don ' t have a file handle, you have a file *name*. Which does the subroutine expect ? __label__4 Please see our ongoing discussion <url>. Is this how you properly send a message ? __label__4 Exactly how is your bignum stored? Or if you don ' t know that, how are you allowed to access it ? __label__4 the question lacks clarity. is this a mathematical question ? __label__4 There are 6190283353629375 ways to pair up 30 people. Do you really want all of them ? __label__4 Actually, material in the lead must be discussed in the body. Contemporary economics haven ' t been discussed in the body, so how can they be discussed in the lead ? __label__4 "*i need to include that function*" What function? "*i need to know an easy way to get it included and get started with it*" What is 'it'?__label__4 What do you mean Justin? I am unsure what you mean by Autobot and Decepticon ? __label__4 did you finally resolve your problem? did you file a bug - report ? __label__4 What do you mean "wont"? What ' s the error or result that you aren ' t expecting ? __label__4 Answered at <url>. Maybe you are not familiar with the expression ? __label__4 Why would one want to re - create GNAA??__label__4 It ' s not that, it ' s just feels .. wrong. An admin especially should be accountable for all his dealings, so why delete the history ? __label__4 Clarification: Do you mean to run the container itself under a hot tap? Is the result really "good as new?"__label__4 I had to revert another one <url>. How about that protection ? __label__4  " I ' ve simply been told before that itsa flow of electrons, but this seems to basic and does show that electricity is instant." Why would this mean that electricity is "instantaneous" ?__label__4 *@RealityCramp* - I have read your question several times and while I think I understand what you might be asking I ' m at a loss regarding the details. Can you please rephrase your question ? __label__4 @Emtucifor: My point is simply that if you ' re going to clutch your pearls this tight and go all " _O tempora o mores!_ " on us, it ' s more convincing if you yourself don ' t exemplify the decline of standards you are bemoaning. If you don ' t hold yourself to a standard of perfection, then what could possibly be the point of your question ? __label__4 You support Scotland leaving the United Kingdom despite the fact most Scots do not? I am curious as to why ? __label__4 In case you didn ' t realize, one of the first things they states on that article was that if the information on a main or major character becomes long, then it warrants its own article. So, if that the case, then why did you merge <url>, since his article is long and he is the main character on <url>?__label__4 Hi, ixb4d like to know why are you constantly removing all information i put in your scm comparison about Plastic SCM. donxb4t we have the right to show there our information as the rest of users ? __label__4 If a then b is true for any b provided that a is false, as it is in your question. So how do you hope to learn anything interesting ? __label__4 Who said the bunks are equidistant? Also, what is a "bunk"?__label__4 I ' m always behind the times. PS- When did you guys decide to ''remove'' the Quebecois nation resolution from that article ' s introduction ? __label__4 Actually it was a compliment. Does that count as an 'issue'?__label__4 That first parameter *will* be your page title .. Have you tested this code? What exactly are you trying to accomplish and what are you seeing that ' s not the behavior you want ? __label__4 LOL, I can ' t believe you reverted Kizzle ' s deletion of my summary at S & aQ. Did you actually like my summary ? __label__4 I ' ve always pondered if there were any 3D games classified as "Metroidvania". Do you know of any other than the Prime series (which I ' ve always considered in the spirit of the classification, but never really dwelled on it)?__label__4 Did you upload ''Image : 11 . jpg'' to make a point about censorship? What exactly is your intention with that image ? __label__4 What platform? Mac, Windows, Linux ? __label__4 Please rephrase your question using full words and complete sentences. Also, what does assembly have to do with this ? __label__4 What is the question here? Are you wondering what you might ' ve missed ? __label__4 Where have you put this material? On a user page somewhere ? __label__4 So they ' re const global variables. Big deal..?__label__4 qsort does sort lines in increasing order, but your definition of "increasing" isn ' t the same as everybody else ' s. Why do you think it ' s more logical to sort strings by length rather than by alphabetical order ? __label__4 i cant see that map service. I assume its dynamic and not cached ? __label__4 The Hitchin - related hoax claims by <url> seem to have led to a rather precipitate response, considering that he has only been an editor for a few days. Is there something going on here that isn ' t obvious ? __label__4 Changed tag to "copyright". Was there a specific tag you were looking to use ? __label__4 You may be experiencing [bug #732677](https://bugs . launchpad . net / ubuntu/+source / bcmwl/+bug / 732677). Can you please edit your question to include the output of `sudo lshw -class network` and `lsmod | grep -E 'b43|ssb|wl'`?__label__4 Would you know what the difference is between 'computing by Operating systems' and 'operating systems"? Not obvious to me, why not just eliminate it and add the computing category to the operating systems category page ? __label__4 That ' s not clear, what kind of distance? You mean orthogonal distance from a side of original rectangle to another one ? __label__4 A redirect works exactly the same way regardless of whether there ' s a space between "#REDIRECT" and the target article ' s name or not. Why bother removing spaces from the redirects if it doesn ' t change the functionality at all ? __label__4 Ah, as I recall it was ''you'' who confused me on that one, by adding them to <url> during the GA review ;) What is the preferred display quote? Does one just use blockquote ? __label__4 The second example in your second question accesses unallocated memory. Was that on purpose ? __label__4 But, before you accuse me of shying away from your second to last question, my PhD is in inorganic chemistry, homogeneous catalysis to be specific, but my latest scientific paper was submitted (still with the reviewers) to ''<url>'': it touches on the metrological consequences of the microscopic quantization of ''Q'', as it happens, although that is not its main thrust. So, do you want to thrash this out among scientists, or would you prefer to waste your time with ArbCom ? __label__4 A _variable_ has scope; an _object_ has a lifetime. What exactly are you asking about ? __label__4 Which way are you trying to identify it? From within code ? __label__4 If the only page you ' ve been visiting is Wikipedia, then it makes sense the viruses would come from here, but if you ' ve been to other sites, they get thrown into the equation. Again, don ' t you have any anti - virus software ? __label__4 No other encyclopedia deals with these charges in their entries on Reagan; encyclopedias have higher standards than supermarket tabloids and Kitty Kelley. On that note, why not post the content you want in the <url> article instead ? __label__4 Don ' t you mean 2N edges? And you want the matching to include all nodes, correct ? __label__4 Your question is too vague. What do you want to achieve exactly, and what did you already tried ? __label__4 You said other sources supported the info in the infobox yet you did not indicate what sources. And why can ' t we use a primary source for his birth date ? __label__4 You added partisan colours for the early Chancellors (such as a conservative blue colour for Bismarck); as the early Chancellors were not attached to any political party, and the "party" given is merely an approximate indication of their political leanings, I ' m not sure if this is a good idea. Also, why did you remove the partisan colour from the last part of the table (the Republic)?__label__4 One side question: It sounds like your yard slopes towards your house. Assuming you don ' t already have any water problems, could adding a deck (which could trap some of the moisture) cause a problem ? __label__4 Without seeing the images, how can we help you? Can you post some links to them ? __label__4 I see you ' ve added <url> to the category "Jewish - Canadians". What is your source for this ? __label__4 Use a thick pen for the line and thin one to draw the border. (BTW, What ' s that got to do with `C++`?)__label__4 Funny, you could not tell it was me.. who else would it be??__label__4 @BoltClock: I ' m pretty sure that algorithms are part of the "programming" subject. Strictly speaking an algorithm is not a program, of course, but are we really going to throw out all the questions on searching and sorting methods, on the grounds that "quicksort is an algorithm, it has absolutely nothing to do with programming"?__label__4 Right, so the links on your userpage? And what is the "article" you want me to check over ? __label__4 Are you referring to loading them using the iPad Camera Connection Kit? If so, are you unable to delete the JPEG preview or the RAW image the JPEG was rendered from ? __label__4 I don ' t see anything there that would indicate that you can use dynamic text to label latitude and longitude. Can you please provide some more information or a methodology ? __label__4 Do you understand how `UIImagePickerController` works? Do you have the delegate methods implemented ? __label__4 @mpiktas: what do you mean with "additional data"? Could you please give an example of this in the car context ? __label__4 Why did you remove you comment on the talk page? Did you change your opinion ? __label__4 I don ' t understand Tasc0??__label__4 Are you saying that it ' s impossible for Wikipedia to admit that most people don ' t know the true meaning of slavery? That it ' s my point of view & original research in understanding what the true meaning of slavery is ? __label__4 Welcome to wikipedia? Does <url> and <url> look like unreferenced uselessness to you ? __label__4 @Jeff OK, OK. This is how wiki works though huh ? __label__4 OK, I give up? What notability is asserted ? __label__4 Reading your help desk comment, I ' m totally confused now. Was it 2005 or 2006 ? __label__4 why o' why? Developing a new DBMS ? __label__4 How can you not know the length of the array? How will you know that your index is out - of - boundaries ? __label__4 ??__label__4 This should possibly be a comment / clarification to original question. Can they be merged ? __label__4 I was not trying to sound rude earlier. Haunted Angel which of my seven reasons had you decided were evidence of his sock puppetry ? __label__4 Umm, it was renamed to <url> as you proposed. Is there something wrong ? __label__4 Where is the vandalism? Diffs ? __label__4 Do you have any experience in Visual Basic? Have you tried reading a tutorial or a book ? __label__4 I have one last question about the SPI I filed et al. before I put this ugly chapter of my time here behind me; should the <url> sock not be tagged with <code><nowiki><person></nowiki></code>?__label__4  " I ' ve found these packages being imported by the model:" The model? To what do you refer ? __label__4 Testing, testing, 1 , 2, 3, are you still alive? Where are you ? __label__4 Actually, I am concerned that you had completely removed verifiable facts of which I had included the references. Would you please explain why you had removed the entire section I wrote on Collection Agencies in Canada ? __label__4 return cell; [tableView deselectRowAtIndexPath : indexPath animated : YES]; why you have code for deselecting row after returning cell??__label__4 I hope I am now signed on and you remove the erroneous vandalism report. Don ' t you think it would be more politic to send a message with a question than to preemptorily declare an edit "vandalism"?__label__4 This guys is both an MCSE (sysadmin) **AND** an MCSD? and you ' re gonna waste his time with reading logfiles ? __label__4 Which API call is producing the exception in question? What are the permissions attached to the path that you aren ' t being allowed to access ? __label__4 Aberayron, certainly. But Aberaryron ?__label__4 Really? Why ? __label__4 My problem is that the Style Guide for cities causes several topics for this small village to be repeated somewhat, especially the railroad, Gas Boom, and stockyard. Any thoughts on this article ' s organization ? __label__4 Do you mean "What can you do with Drush that goes beyond what you can do through the Drupal web interface?" or "Can Drush be used for things besides Drupal?"__label__4 <url> is a validly notable topic which has been ruthlessly suppressed at WP, probably because of egoism rather than religionist POV warriors but possibly both. Can you advise me on how to go about appealling deletions ? __label__4 I didn ' t remove the image; I just moved it down to the bottom of the box, to avoid having a long stack of images at the top. Is that a problem ? __label__4 Nice close shot, but almost too minimalist.. Now I and James Barrie can ' t agree if this is the inside or the outside of the wok. Can you throw some light on the matter ? __label__4 Great. Any reason why SCIRS is still an essay and not a content guideline ? __label__4 Hey, why do you edit the standings when a game isnxb4t over??__label__4 I know I can lose characters. But you find it normal that half the text after a particular character is lost though it does not contain special chars ?__label__4 I nominated <url> for speedy renaming to <url> and you removed it saying it was moved to /Working, but I don ' t see it there and it hasn ' t been renamed. Do you know what happened ? __label__4 What is the question? What is wrong with it ? __label__4 Done. Comments ? __label__4 Also, that photo isn ' t showing up for me. Can anyone else see it ? __label__4 comment from a member of the Article Rescue Squadron? Do you know how to hide a human body ? __label__4 arg, sorry. I was fiddling around with item formatting all day long I started to believe you can ' t use formatting in item[] at all.. Should I delete the question ? __label__4 At first blush this question seems purely mathematical: visualizing the function has nothing to do with the distribution of its arguments. However, the reference to "heteroskedasticity" suggests you ' re really trying to visualize an object that is more explicitly represented as $f ( x _ 1, .., x _ k) + \epsilon$ or more generally as $g ( f ( x _ 1, .., x _ k), \epsilon)$ where $epsilon$ is a zero - mean random variable and $g ( z , 0) = z$ for all z. Isn ' t this just a response - surface analysis ? __label__4 I think one reason people think it ' s a lame question is that the OP didn ' t posit even one reason developing such a game would seem to be easy. Kind of like asking "Why is it so hard to fly like superman?"__label__4 I was under the impression that it was also more efficient (less air resistance in the ductwork). Is that not the case ? __label__4 This is a very broad topic. Akin to, "How is cake made, and what are the ingredients?"__label__4 Did you mean to post this answer to a different question? If not, could you please clarify how an answer about adding filters to custom post types has anything to do with using a tagging plugin ? __label__4 See <url>. I assume you didn ' t mean <url> ?__label__4 Using Apache? How about mod _ security ? __label__4 I am far from worked up over this, but find it hard to AGF when someone tries to include inaccurate information into an article, claiming it had been checked by an administrator. Who was the administrator ? __label__4 On the third reading.. Why not include an edit summary that tells me this? Why not revert my revert ? __label__4 This feels like a duplicate of http://programmers . stackexchange . com / questions / 217 / should - i - keep - realbasic - on - my - resume and maybe we could make that question general. (Should I keep X on my resume?)__label__4 To quote Scott Meyers: "`make`? Who needs stinkin `make`?".__label__4 <url> - You made a bold edit, I reverted and now we discuss. Is there a reason why the Wikipedia editor generated filmography should be deleted and replaced by a link to an outside site ? __label__4 I ' m not sure I fully understand the problem. Are pick - an - email@domain addresses going to catchall@domain or does `pick - an - email` stand for one of the "real" addresses ? __label__4 There is no need to swallow initial whitespaces of lines; they are ignored anyway. Can you please edit your answer accordingly ? __label__4 Your wiki or someone else ' s? What wiki software ? __label__4 Could you share the relevant information with us *irrespective* of whether it is an exception, and error, or something else? Also, what does because I must there KeyPairValuOfStringAndCarType mean ? __label__4 I eat rarely. Is that bad ? __label__4 I added commentary. Does that explain what happens now ? __label__4 Are you trying to print the possible ways to express your number as a sum? You know there are an infinite number of ways to do that, right ? __label__4 @IVIAD: "Is Not My Vehicle Maybe his Yellow Mazda and Listen, Sir.. Aardvarks instill OBESITY!" Am I right ? __label__4 Can ' t you just filter out the value NULL before you process the records? Or did I miss something ? __label__4 @Aaronut Can ' t someone do this besides the OP? Don ' t we have some sort of mod people ? __label__4 Does it REALLY have to be IrfanView? Why not a free library like FreeImage or ImageMagick ? __label__4 `a` cannot equal 2<sup>779</sup> in standard C or C++ unless you ' ve defined a custom numeric type. If you do have one, why not just **try it**?__label__4 I ' m not sure what you are asking here. Admins cannot check IPs but why would you even want the same IP that would be foolish wouldn ' t it ? __label__4 Does it have to be a vegetable? Why not some other sauce? Why not zucchini and a protein ? __label__4 @code: Heh - heh.. missed that. Can you please add [StackCenter](http://stackapps . com / questions / 114 / stackcenter - your - one - stop - for - everything - stackexchange) to your list of apps that use Soapi . JS ? __label__4 The information itself obviously demonstrates notability. I ' m sure other sources can be found, however & mdash ; will you back off if other sources are added ? __label__4 Okay, so I did what it said and I sent a message to an admin. Now what do I do ? __label__4 Do you have problem with it? Does it work ? __label__4 Further to what Stefan said, the tocloft package might be sensitive to other things you have in your preamble. Could you post a [minimum working example](http://meta . tex . stackexchange . com / questions / 228 / ive - just - been - told - i - have - to - write - a - minimal - example - what - is - that), please ? __label__4 Why are you using jQuery here in the first place, it doesn ' t seem to be doing any good. Can ' t you just output the name inside the element directly ? __label__4 Complexity of what? Time complexity of some operation ? __label__4 Why the removal of the citation dealing with coriolis? Was the proof not within the citation, or was the citation not considered primary ? __label__4 Sorry, we were discussing iPad, but we did go through the overall state of Apple ' s products. Can you please address the other parts of the question ? __label__4 Figures as much. What ' s wrong with it ? __label__4 you mean as if you ' d print screen it ? or what ? __label__4 You are wasting a lot of power in the 150 ohm resistors. What is the 55 for ? __label__4 `else if` serves a very different purpose than a simple `if`. How can you code without `else if`?__label__4 So far there are four editors on <url> who have called you on your edit - warring. Would you please stop ? __label__4 Unfortunately I think <url> may also add that material; I am not familiar with Citizendum, though, but I will look at it. If Citizendum has the same policies regarding primary, secondary, and tertiary sources, then why not criticize both Wikipedia and Citizendum ? __label__4 These are my numbers: 7 years in Wikipedia, 6 years as an admin, 570+ articles, 4 featured articles, 1 featured list, 21 Good articles, 60 DYK ' s - After six years as an admin. I recently made some mistakes and I can understand if I am placed in some type of probation were I am monitored and forbidden to use my tools maybe for a year, but do I really merit the removal of my adminship ? __label__4 Okay, let ' s leave the naming thing posponed for now, why are you reverting the <url>-catagory thing? just because (as you say) Iraq was formed post - WWI that doesn ' t mean that they aren ' t the same people ? __label__4 Wassat? LeaveVissToYou ? __label__4 Yes, I am using an "ancient" version: OS X 10 . 4 . 11 and XCode 2 . 5! Is that the problem ? __label__4 Do you really need to produce separate pdf files? Maybe the `\include` and `\includeonly` features would be enough for you ? __label__4 I don ' t see why the trivial greedy algorithm does not work? Am I missing something ? __label__4 Why is your AWB robot changing ''&amp ; Oslash;'' to the letter ''xd8''? I asked you if all computers in the World are set up to read &Oslash; ?__label__4 hi zaky, i m using xcode 4 tat rename button doesnt exist anymore.. hi vakio, yes i can see "SimpleScrollView" still in the pbxproj, wat do u mean by "rename the executable"?__label__4 What ' s the benefit of the horizontal dropout? Is it safety? Is it just a style? Is it ease of maintenance ? __label__4 In your most recent edit to <url> you stated that the track in Clermont, Florida does not fulfill IAAF regulations (since reverted by another editor). On what grounds does it not and do you have a source for that remark ? __label__4 What language are you looking for? C / C++?__label__4 OK, now I ' m curious. Why isn ' t this a syntax error ? __label__4 your answer is too broad - can you try to give a little focus as where the question points? what aspect is relevant ? __label__4 I understand that *part* of the problem behind using cooking oil is that it goes bad and can smell faintly like, well, rotting food. Why does cooking oil do this and not chain lube ? __label__4 These events are fictional. What real - world information can there be about them ? __label__4 One more thing, you have a fellow Budgie insisting a losing appearance in an FA Cup semi is an "Honour" for your club. I guess it ' s because you haven ' t won much lately, but really, a losing semi - finalist isn ' t an honour in the real sense of the word, is it ? __label__4 Sure, but that ' s true of any investment you make. What are the top 50 features in a word processor ? __label__4 Are you saying that Scotty was being "hot - headed"? If so, can you please tell us what Scotty did that was "hot - headed"?__label__4 just curious, why do you change filters so often ? __label__4 I don ' t understand this. There is an infinite number of possible strings between "a longer string" and "another long string", so how can you guarantee unique values ? __label__4 I notice yall were trying to get some Canadian articles featured. How many Canadian articles are even at that status ? __label__4 Owing to your status as an active wikipedian, I ' m not yet reverting your edit to this article. But what sense is it to move his birth location from the birthdate position in line one, to the top of (a newly formed) paragraph 2 which then (continues from the former paragraph 1 subject) takes off on a subject entirely unrelated to his birth ? __label__4 I ' ve just seen your message on my Talk page. Why do you want the disambiguation page to be the one that doesn ' t say "disambiguation"?__label__4 Why are records of the Julianna posers changes being deleted? Even if this really was her, do celebrities get special privlidges on wikipedia ? __label__4 I don ' t see any element with ID or name of `sel2`. What gives ? __label__4 I realise it may seem ridiculous, but until the copyright holder has released it, we cannot use it (except under a claim of fair use, but this wouldn ' t fall under our rather strict <url>). I will delete the image now- why not draw your own map ? __label__4 Change them to what? If that is your input, what is your desired output ? __label__4 A module that is causing a fatal error because it ' s invoking a method of a non - object is clearly a bug in a module; it ' s difficult to say which module is causing the error, as the error is appending in a Views file, but it could depend from a parameter passed to a Views function from another module. (Is it Panels or APK?)__label__4 Even worse: "The authorized use of this data is limited to informational and educational purposes only, and NOT for operational or commercial purposes." This clearly disqualifies the text for Wikipedia purposes, I ' m afraid we ' ll have to delete the article. Do you know of any similar contributions you ' ve made ? __label__4 possible duplicate of [Simple algorithm for online outlier detection of a generic time series](http://stats . stackexchange . com / questions / 1142 / simple - algorithm - for - online - outlier - detection - of - a - generic - time - series) This question is proposed to be closed as a duplicate. Could you please let us know at the meta thread if and how your context is different from the question I linked ? __label__4 How are you converting to decimal? Why wouldn ' t that same method work for conversion to ternary ? __label__4 What kind of generator have you tried? What do you mean by "didn ' t get any success"?__label__4 I ' ve removed my remark. But if somebody puts words in another ' s mouth, and that second person states that is not what he meant, and the first person responds that no, that ''is'' what the second person meant, well, wouldn ' t you say that ' s a little weird ? __label__4 Please stop removing properly referenced information that I have added to this article. This is an article that <b>YOU</b> nominated for deletion, so why are you even editing it ? __label__4 Is there a reason you dont just let IIS do this for you? Or use the `<authorization>` features in your web . config ? __label__4 @user597861: That looks like Java. Why aren ' t you just using `A . length`?__label__4 Couldn ' t this have been appended to that discussion? Or googled ? __label__4 I ' d suggest you get an iPod Touch to develop on then. Don ' t tell me you need something iPhone specific for your application like GPS? :)__label__4 Ditto? whats the deal ? __label__4 I use that template, because it cannot be missed on a page, because it allows for different reasons for blocking (template : blocked is "vandalism", only, and takes 2 edits to change to something else), and because it gives instructions for requesting unblock. What is the objection to it ? __label__4 My impression is that it depends on the culture that ' s making the pie.. in France, apple pie is a tart with one crust, but American apple pie traditionally has two. Anyone know ? __label__4 Back on topic Jigglyfidders; I totally agree with Deconstructhis on this one. What will you do to address this issue ? __label__4 Which ones? Activision, MS, all? :)__label__4 @shodanex: The issue is likely to be specific to your particular hardware (or virtual machine), so you should describe it. Also, does the clock still drift if you turn “synchronize with internet” off ? __label__4 It ' s a low - profile page in the sense of not getting much attention from editors. Why do you think addressing Luther ' s views on grace is necessary to understand contemporary philosophy ? __label__4 sorry, there aren ' t enough details for me to even begin answering. Could you include some more information ? __label__4 it just goes to update . php? nothing after ?__label__4 It looks like these are the cases, not actual references. Am I wrong ? __label__4 Hey, look at this, I don ' t even know your name! Quel est votre nom, Mademoiselle ? __label__4 Perhaps this is best seen as a way to structure the design of a large - scale digital circuit (just like it might be a good idea to use subroutines in a large - scale computer program), and not really as a formal lower bound? (Chapter 14 of the book that you linked has plenty of Theorems with Proofs, but they seem to assume that you follow certain principles in the design of the circuit?)__label__4 I just noticed you ' ve added me as a sock puppet for Blue Sea? Can I ask what led you to this conclusion ? __label__4 Sry this explains to me.. I want to rewrite this solution [link](http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 5636413 / how - to - determine - maximum - route - cost - in - a - n - high - numeric - pyramid) in ruby. And why did you say poorly implementing ? __label__4  " the density function in both polar and cartesian coordinates becomes a constant" What does density in polar coordinates mean? Is it even possible to have constant density in both coordinate systems ? __label__4 Have you actually installed one of these things on your website, and what experiences did you have with it ? __label__4 schoolwork? it ' s a strange query, don ' t you have more information for us ? __label__4 This cannot be the *only* relevant parts of your code, because this compiles fine. Are you sure that the error message really corresponds to the lines you ' ve shown here ? __label__4 I ' m with you - it really is a friggin' pain that people refuse to read no matter how big you put the text. Should we just maybe remove the source entirely ? __label__4 Oh..it is a spider with 'pajek'. Is it really necessary ? __label__4 Hmm, Apple software on Windows question. I guess the "Apple Software" part defines the fact that you posted it here ? __label__4 Why do you think there should be a klass method on the class you are using? What are you trying to achieve ? __label__4 What ordering are you assuming for @array2. In other words, why does the count for 'one' come before the count for 'two'?__label__4 please can you confirm where you have downloaded moonlight - and which version (add this to your question). Also, which websites are not working (add the links)?__label__4 You mean _orthogonal_ forms? right ? __label__4 He has said its for ASP! or am I missing something ? __label__4 The race was advertised and billed as the 100th Indy 500. Are you saying the promoters and Indycar are liars ? __label__4 You mean the links that are being edit warred over? I can, but first can you explain what the edit war was all about and what the point of the links are ? __label__4 Weren ' t you involved with <url> (aka "wikibugs") at some point? Is it dead ? __label__4 Hmm, see you just reverted back. What ' s the bot ' s job suppost to be ? __label__4 Actually, it IS quote - mining when you provide a quote from an author that is the exact opposite of the primary meaning and intention of the author. Let me ask you, then, what was the primary message of the Linde letter to the editor ? __label__4 sorry, no idea what the code should do. Is the selected in the db or what ? __label__4 That ' s a couple levels of automation beyond my experience. But if you just got the idea today, then how can you know the false positive level is low enough for WP : AWB / Typos ? __label__4 @Kosmonaut, I have to admit I ' d side with @Tony on this one, at least in the UK, *voila* would be used as a 'consciously' French word, whereas Envelope, brilliant wouldn ' t. [Almost worth another question?)__label__4 @dan and sri, Sorry if this is too far from the original question, but is there a manner of linking (ie. the type of URL I use in my post) I can use to attempt to maintain the header (I ' m *imagining* some `rel=` attribute to the effect of the capturing it), or does HTTPS always strip it out ? __label__4 What do you mean by "How to calculate"? Do you actually want to know the how the algorithmic complexity of stack operations is derived, or do you just want to know the answers ? __label__4 SPI is not for just simple yes no answers. Why did you not warn the Minneapolis IP, they are warring as much as Bb23 ? __label__4 That ' s exaxtly what i meant for the point one..and as you said 200 in 1 week is definetly more impressive than 100 in 1 year..Considering that i have a mysql db, php in the middle to make query and return json object and java for my android client that get the json and parse it . At wich level this "ordering" algorith should work? for example on the flight in php page..it mean that that the db is not ordered and in the php page i make a query enfding with ORDER BY and than my function ordering , or the MYsql db shoul already ordered , maybe running my algoruth once a day to reorder app table ? __label__4 Yes, I know what a score ''card'' is, but you wrote "score ''car''" in the article. Was that a typo, or is there really such a thing as a score "car"?__label__4 <url> Well there is no name to the byline, which an article in a newspaper usually has, op - ed or editorials not so much. Do you not think you should have gone to talk before reverting btw ? __label__4 And I guess with exception of 7 countries that recognize same - sex marriage, everybody else would end up in "homophobia" category. Or what would be the threshold ? __label__4 Afterthought: where did you get your figure of 82500 tons pa??__label__4 What if there is no idle worker, how do you intend to deal with that? Just queue them up ? __label__4 I have some made some improvements to the articles you references on the above user ' s talk page. Perhaps next time you would bring your concerns directly to ''me''?__label__4 I ' m sorry but how do I delete old keys? All the keys or just those two ? __label__4 1. Could you please give us a small but complete example showing the problem. 2. Have you already tried replacing the float package by floatrow ? __label__4 I see you removed the review, which makes sense until at least four days from now, when it won ' t be mentioned on the mainpage at all. But maybe leave a note at <url> so he doesn ' t feel put - off ? __label__4 Also, @Ahh or Cedric, can you please edit the question title so it asks "for modern physics" instead of general background? And by modern physics, do you mean quantum mechanics, relativity, quantum electrodynamics, and particle physics ? __label__4 Do you not have even tiny holes for ventilation you could sample through? And do you regard a toothpick hole as looking really bad ? __label__4  " Get Up" was released in Canada??__label__4 I ' m using javascript to include other html files. <-- why ? __label__4 Why was <url> deleted when it was simply a crop of <url> which is public domain? I ' m pretty sure I wrote that on the description page, but if not, can it be restored ? __label__4 What exactly do you want to warn about, and what exactly do you want the message to be? How is `@Deprecated` itself not meeting your needs ? __label__4 We already list Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia separately. Along with Belarus and Ukraine, that doesn ' t leave much of the USSR that was occupied, does it ? __label__4 IMDB calls her Ethyl, not Ethel. Which is it ? __label__4 You never mentioned how far it is to work? How fast you ride ? __label__4 How much data are you backing up daily, weekly, monthly? How much data do you plan to retain, and for how long ? __label__4 I don ' t think I ' ll ever understand the "subjective and argumentative" thing for community Wikis. If nobody ' s getting rep, what harm does it do ?__label__4 You want *all* the paths? You want *all simple paths containing at least two members of the subset*?__label__4 Please enlighten me. How can a developer make doubly sure that his / her fix is correct if he / she can ' t reproduce the bug ? __label__4 task == homework? ^^ Moreover: what is supposed to output this newly invented `diff`?__label__4 @T . E . D.: Um..thank you ? __label__4 Why have you cut out the interesting bit from the Apache confs? Where ' s the `ServerName`/`ServerAlias` stuff ? __label__4 The answers here (http://cooking . stackexchange . com / questions / 8618 / stopping - water - from - bubbling - over - when - cooking - rice) may be of help to you. For example, do you wash your rice before cooking ? __label__4 Sorry to be daft, but where do I find the community wiki? Is that another name for the Metas site or is it something completely different ? __label__4 this is not merging, this is sorting. BTW what are those objects (a1 b1 ..) string ? __label__4 What are you trying to do? Why can ' t you just store the "Range"?__label__4 I ' d guess it ' s an archaic past tense of "to owe", i . e. "Which you owed yesterday"?__label__4 What part of that are you confused about? [this](http://ww . quirksmode . org / js / this . html)?__label__4 Yeah, I already noticed that. Why can ' t people can just edit in a responsible fashion, or through ''discussion with others''?__label__4 list b? I don ' t get it.. mind to explain more ? __label__4 So the request *does* actually make it to your `update` method (i . e. gets routed via the mappings with the `PUT` method correctly)?__label__4 If you serve a thousand of these per page you ' re hitting 49 kilobytes. How many of these could you possibly be serving ? __label__4 I know, I looked it up and fixed the article, but it was annoying that you just changed one small thing making the page contradict itself. What ' s the use changing it if the reader will have no idea what ' s going on ? __label__4  ' Buffering of video for multiple channels' sounds likely to be problematic - if you ' re saying that the client will receive all channels and show only one, in order that the user can switch between them quickly. Did you try posting to Stack Overflow ? __label__4 Anyone know if this just for the galaxy s? I don ' t think I ' ve ever seen this in stock Android or cyanogenmod ? __label__4 Show more declarations, what is the type of the curr _ time2 variable? How is the get _ time _ in _ seconds() function declared ? __label__4 I don ' t see why you would prefer academic papers over actual solutions. For example, have you looked at how Doxygen does this ? __label__4 Interesting. Are these log - based analytics or something like Google Analytics ? __label__4 The question is quite unclear. Can you provide a test - case ? __label__4 HTML5 is very diverse and can serve many different purposes. What is the main goal of your site ? __label__4 This is a rant why you do not want to use LaTeX, not a question. So, what exactly is your question ? __label__4 There you go, it ' s GA now. Have you done anything else that ' s gotten to GA ? __label__4 He ' s aware of "perdoc", but he doesn ' t know how to search? And he ' s annoyed by it having MORE than just a list of functions ? __label__4 Email from the Darkshado guy complaining about you adding him to the spamlist. I searched the site and couldn ' t find any of our articles replicated there; has he removed them, or what ? __label__4 I ' m not seeing it. Has it been fixed ? __label__4 Yes, I can change the font. Could you please provide me with an example ? __label__4 You haven ' t told us anything about the value of n2? Is it constant from (i) to (ii)?__label__4 Ok, so could you be specific what is problematic for? Maybe show some code ? __label__4 "..without considerably more context" - I am sorry for being, perhaps, too annoying, but your last words give me some hope that "speaking tings" is still possible under some very very specific circumstances, some broader context. Can you, please, try to come up with such context ? __label__4 It ' s been four days. Still haven ' t tried the hotfix ? __label__4 Based on what? Don ' t you think a little discussion is in order before doing this ? __label__4 I am not sure why you feel that in regression you will get R2 = 1 if you try to predict the predicted variable. Can you clarify ? __label__4 You created an object of class `A`. Why would a `print _ r` in some instance of class `B` have access to something you changed in a different instance of class `A`?__label__4 So? what is the question? "The code ' s not working", is that the question ? __label__4 You don ' t have any call to `fork()` in your sample program. Is this intentional ? __label__4 Miten sxe4 osaat nii hyvin suomee jos sun xe4idinkieli on kumminki englanti? Onks sul suomenkieliset vanhemmat tai jotai vai ootsxe4 vaa opiskellu ite tosi paljo suomee ? __label__4 What do you mean? How am I supposed to vindicate myself of this ridiculous accusation ? __label__4 wants to move from a free nation like th US to a tyrannical country like the UK. Give me an honest opinion Haunted Angel what do you yhink of him ? __label__4 Why do you want to "fit ellipses"? Isn ' t enough to "find ellipses"?__label__4 I ' m not sure how you ' re having this problem - Ctrl+Shift+Left / Right cursor jumps text and highlights. What programs are you experiencing this issue in ? __label__4 Why do you need 200 variables? Why not have one array with 200 elements ? __label__4 very similar question: http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 1083017 / iphone - socket - program Have you tried searching with google or something ? __label__4 It ' s not off topic, and I see no comment in that other discussion on the merits of WMC ' s Martian push -- in fact, you evaded the question. So I take it that this is a refusal to answer ? __label__4 Yesterday you undid an edit of mine (on the <url> article). What did you mean by "a COI link"?__label__4 Actually, the page is still up, and I ' m still getting a deluge of obscene phone calls and emails in an effort to punish me for constructive editing on Wikipedia consistent with Wikipedia policies and guidelines. Is <url> and <url> a policy or isn ' t it ? __label__4 ..and how small are you hoping the hash result will be, given that the input is only 11 bytes? Or do you mean there are 11 separate values ? __label__4  " I will be retiring to the Cayman Islands shortly with the riches I ' m gathering through my Wikipedia editing of political pages." - ''(From your userpage)'' - You ' re joking, right? Oh, and you ' re also joking about being a Republican too ? __label__4 Kidding about what? Are there no reliable sources ? __label__4 How do you know it ' s not returning a 64 - bit pointer? Have you done `sizeof ( void *)` to check ? __label__4 What ' s "shortening"? Is that another name for margarines ? __label__4 You need to narrow the problem down. Is your question actually "how do I update an entity reference in EF"?__label__4 Ruby on Rails runs at the server side. So how about using that ? __label__4 Wikipedia is not IMDb, which can easily be used (and is more suited) to providing complete soundtrack listings for pretty much every movie ever made. Would you care to address any of the other points I ' ve brought up ? __label__4 Who does not want to see such questions might want to include poll and subjective into the ignored tags. ;-) What is the point of it being a wiki ? __label__4 How hot was your oven? did you glaze the pastry prior to baking ? __label__4 How far have you gotten? What kind of code have you written ? __label__4 Hi. The original link (http://ww . lgso . org . uk / index . htm) gives a 404 error, but the amended URL (http://ww . lgso . org . uk/) works for me, so why do you say it ' s still dead ? __label__4 Huh, looks fine to me. Maybe this computer just lies to me to get me to shut up and stop complaining ? __label__4 But ATT is a re - statement of NOR and V. We don ' t need a re - statement of them and then call it RS. What would be the point ? __label__4 You said: "I am just upset that you are harassing a person who seems to be trying to better himself and his relationship with fellow wikipedians." First, I ' m harrassing no - one, and it would be better if you didn ' t make such accusations. Secondly, what evidence do you see that SS is trying to do anything of the kind ? __label__4 It looks like you will have the device powered for most of the time that you have valid data. Isn ' t a battery backup - ed SRAM more appropriate than an EEPROM (or better, Flash) then ? __label__4 I have noticed that you added the reference to him living in NZ. Do you know anymore ? __label__4 You reverted my removal of the "to critical acclaim" description from this article. I cannot see where in <url> there is a basis for that claim - it looks like a neutral factual review to me ? __label__4 Why revert? Shouldn ' t it be included somewhere in the discography ? __label__4 Why voted down? Fair enough question, yes ? __label__4 All of the answers to that othe question are correct. Do you really need help updating a datbase or do you need help working with the Perl standard - data - structures ? __label__4 Yes, Pavel. That is correct (frame problem, much?) :(__label__4 Looks like you ' re passing null to an API parameter, particularly a null Overlay somewhere in a mapview probably. How are we supposed to know ? __label__4 Yeah, at the moment. Unless there are any other dryandras on the cusp of GA - hood..?__label__4 What do you mean by *"the compiler thinks it ' s an integer"*. How can the compiler think a 30 - digit number is an `Integer`?__label__4 Please provide the example of what you want to achieve. What exactly you do not get ? __label__4 -- Though I thought I would note that you have now exceeded <big>''500''</big> edits while on "wikibreak" and that is over less than 10 days, May I ask what kind of break is that??__label__4 How are these inconsistent with the traditional account of the origins of the Torah involving redactions as late as Ezra? Why do we need bizarre hypotheses about documents being interwoven that are contrary to all known examples of how books are written ? __label__4 First you need to be precise in what you want to describe. What kind of Illy are we talking about ? __label__4 Lionel, tell me the truth. How long have you known BelloMello was wMo ? __label__4 I believe supserstition exists. Why did you ask me ? __label__4 I didn ' t have those in <person> because they were already included under the tributaries categories. Is this one of those "basketball player" exceptions ? __label__4 Why do you want to show multiple tooltips for a single control? Why not just combine the contents of the two into a single tooltip ? __label__4 I see you moved and renamed.. um, it.. to <url>. Are you sure about that, given the conventions at <url>?__label__4 See my recent edit as he was not charged for one of the events so not all are criminal. What do you mean by my identification ? __label__4 You took me by surprise on this one with your comment - what about the obedience a diocesan priest owes to his bishop? And I was under the impression that all Latin - rite priests took simple vows of chastity ? __label__4 According to google this is likly to be a bug in your TeX distribution. What operating system and TeX distribution are you using ? __label__4 Why avoid it? Is "November 6,<br>2010" somehow a more desired rendering than "6 November<br>2010"?__label__4 What are you programming on, where 16MB is too much? A phone ? __label__4 This is programming related.

What am I missing ? __label__4 @sepp2k isn ' t fnc declaration and "worded" postcondition sufficient for this task (I wasn ' t given definition at all by the way)? What for would one need to see guts of a fnc in order to be able to give formal proof for postcondition ? __label__4 Any particular reason you ' re thinking of `O ( n * log ( log ( n))`? Or is that just something that spontaneously came into your head ? __label__4 So a fixed gear with no brakes would count? I mean, using the pedals to stop the rear wheel does qualify, no ? __label__4 <url> suddenly has a bunch of new entries for today. Did you change the program ? __label__4 Just wondering, is there any reason why you removed categories from a number of articles and replaced them with the non - existend <url>. Wouldn ' t <url> have been the better choice, which, as it appears, is a category you yourself created a few days ago ? __label__4 Is this a business website or a consumer oriented website? Or are you asking for solutions to both scenarios ? __label__4 What do you mean by "one edit war away"? And whats a siteban ? __label__4 Unclear. Is that one process ? __label__4 It seems <url> has tagged the following baiting articles <url> <url> <url> and <url> with a delete tag out of spite. It there a way to remedy this type of poor behaviour ?__label__4 99% of my use is C++ .. I don ' t know what they did but it ' s horrid.

Why are there no comments in your code ? __label__4  " Wordpress is not designed performance wise in the end" Making wild statements like that with no proof or backup is just flamebait.

Are you just in a shell prompt, or are you trying to capture arrow keys in an irb prompt ? __label__4 Thanks! Can you please explain me in a way that a mere CS major can understand, how can I get this filter, and what should this filter, erm, filter ? __label__4 You say it ' s not compiling. Do you understand the error message ? __label__4 a bit late I know but I just saw this question. Shouldn ' t it be on http://ww . superuser . com ?__label__4  " with just an index" to what? is this homework ? __label__4 If it ' s read - only .. what exactly are you testing? I presume (because it ' s read - only) that the data is input from somewhere else and Rails is just consuming it ? __label__4 Reading the guideline again: ''The name of each article (a link to the articles is recommended as well) in which fair use is claimed for the item''. Where does that say I ''need'' a link to the article ? __label__4 He ' s gone. Was it something I said ? __label__4 There is no image attached. Also, what have you tried by yourself ? __label__4 I ' ve never tried comparing them, but I ' d be very surprised if you saw a difference. Isn ' t the SQL engine going to optimize this for you ? __label__4 I ' m sorry, but I don ' t see the value in having different criteria for two versions of the same list, one sorted by name and one sorted by nationality. Every other list and article on space travel uses the altitude definition, why would the sub - list sorted by nationality be different ? __label__4 If you know nothing about the structure of the URLs, then it ' s impossible to do. How should the algorithm find out whether to group `a / b / c` with `a / d / c` or `a / b / e`?__label__4 Does that mean we ' re not allowed to ask WordPress questions on SO, even if they ' re legitimate programming questions?

Are <url> and <url> the same team ? __label__4 Having the number of managed threads isn ' t very meaningful as a metric; most of those threads will have near - zero overhead when they ' re sleeping. Why do you want to know ? __label__4 You ' re probably trying to optimize the wrong thing. I ' m wondering why you think this particular part of the language is so important ? __label__4 He ' s now been asked if he is ''the'' Alex Salmond and if not he should make that known. Imagine if he was ? __label__4 One question - how come the page is marked as "in dispute"? The data that is currently posted isn ' t in dispute, correct ? __label__4 What do you mean? exact practical view ? __label__4 I have also put speedy delete tags on <url> and <url>. Was there any particular reason to move your user / user talk pages to that name, and back again ? __label__4 why not `fprintf`? is this a homework ? __label__4 I don ' t think anyone ' s going to be able to help you based on that information alone (considering we don ' t know what `0x306aeaa5` is). Can you post your code and tell us what the exact problem is ? __label__4 Just to let you know, you appear to have conducted the same blanking of links four times within a 24 - hour period, in three different instances. Shall I report you for this, or will you kindly restore the links ? __label__4 I ' ve gotten curious about your experiences interviewing Russians. Would you go into details please ? __label__4 While watching the contribs I noticed that the bot blanked <url> which has already been checked and is listed at <url>.

Why does the file need to be only available on create ? __label__4 If the ads are script elements, does it really matter where you place them? Perhaps you can give an example ? __label__4 I am not equally confident about this pinning one: <person>. Hector again ? __label__4 That ' s still not the original source, and after searching through a few pages on Flickr, I ' m assuming the original is all rights reserved anyway. Can I ask why you believe it is public domain ? __label__4 I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Please be more precise ? __label__4 Is there any way I could talk you into being more conservative with creation of new articles? Do you agree that some of what you ' re creating here would be seen as obviously deletable material by most editors ? __label__4 Please elaborate. Does it mean it ' s planned for Oneiric ? __label__4 hmm. off topic ? __label__4 Terrible question title. I don ' t know enough about graphs to generate a better one - any suggestions ? __label__4 Seems like a roundabout way to get an address structure to me. Why not just pass "2a00 : 1450 : 8006::68" to `getaddrinfo`?__label__4 Depending on how you do it you won ' t lose any data. Which build do you have now ? __label__4 This question is too vague. Please could you make it clearer exactly what it is you are asking ? __label__4 You ' re welcome to revert edits, but I ' m puzzled as to why you reverted this one - it seems absolutely essential to me the give a summary of Genesis 1. And if you revert Gen1, why leave Gen2 ? __label__4 Why the downvote? Am I missing something ? __label__4 One more thing. How is the policy of "you ' re not allowed to block someone for personally attacking you" unworkable ? __label__4 How did you learn Interlingua? Was it an online course like lernu, or what ? __label__4 Why do you need randomness? Why can ' t you use sequential strings ? __label__4 I don ' t think I ' ll have the time to keep the flies off it all week but I ' ll have a go (I might get around to incorporating Caitlin Moran ' s detailed reviews too). Could you not semi it as well ? __label__4 Why are you doing `{% ifequal gallery . draft True %}`? Why not do `{% if gallery . draft %}`?__label__4 More time spent does not imply more dollars spent. If the decision is between having to pay five developers for a month or having customers wait 0 . 5s longer for a request, what would you choose ? __label__4 Is there any reason you keep moving boldface marks? ITN is on my watchlist and you seem to do this quite frequently, yet, as far as I can see, it makes no difference, so I feel compelled to ask if there ' s any particular reason ? __label__4 I ' m curious. Why $65cm²$ ?__label__4 The Nyan Cat is a flying cat with a toast instead of its body. Isn ' t quite similar ? __label__4 Why doesnt belong there??__label__4 Wikipedia is not the place for new information. How would we know if it was true or not if someone credible hasn ' t verified it ? __label__4 What ' s your question? Whether or not to use MonoDroid ? __label__4 There ' s too little information. How about posting some code ? __label__4 Take a look at: <url> Baltimore ' s were ordered as Recon bomber/ Great Britain - this is the GR designation??__label__4 no.. there is no viewForSection method. What images are you referring to ? __label__4 Homework? Who told you that checking the precondition is a bad idea ? __label__4 Wouldn ' t R and C just be fixed numbers? What error are you getting ? __label__4 what about my answer? didn ' t it help ? __label__4 @jtbandes Its not a home work.. i wanted to know the appropriate algoritm basically. @pascal using temporary dictionary means using extra memory ( storage)?__label__4 Not really, no (though maybe with JS). Is `display: block` a problem for some reason ? __label__4 I see a number of possible apps when I search in the Market for "mp3 tag". Did you try that ? __label__4 I understand your point about MJ being very close and having competent editors, but do you not think those of us who understand the source problems, etc. that the Reagan page is having should try and explain them to those editors (that is, try to educate them)?__label__4 Do you have a specific question ? E . g. which part are you having difficulty with ?__label__4 @martin . malek — I ' ve edited the title. Does that accurately reflect what you ' re looking for ? __label__4  " a method that exposes all info of a team" .. exposes how? `return this;`?__label__4 Have you tried simply turning your muffins at some point in the baking process ? __label__4 So you are still sidestepping the question. Please answer it directly: please answer my question, clearly: are you saying is that you cannot use the wiki to edit cooperatively with other people on the same text, or are you saying that you can use the wiki as it was intended and edit a single text cooperatively ? __label__4 What is your relation to these authors? Are you writing a package, or editing a publication ? __label__4 Let ' s pretend that we have reached an impasse and then we can stop talking to each other. Deal ? __label__4 And as I ' ve said already, look at how Apple do it. Have you looked at how CoreDataBooks works ? __label__4 Do you really think it is necessary to do that? Could you not simply take my advice on board ? __label__4 @Georg : Anyway, I inended to answer both questions. Do you think I should edit my answer to make this clearer ?__label__4 I can ' t repro, have you tried decompressing the payload with gzip? Is it valid ? __label__4 Note them where? On their talk page, or by adding them to the list you created at ArbCom so a clerk can notify them ? __label__4 This is still, even after the edit, unclear. Do you want to say that she is right and this was the best she could have said in this situation, or do you want to ask her whether she has nothing better to say, or do you want to add to the answer and propose the best follow up to her remark ? __label__4 Hmm. Over ? __label__4 Huh?! You really want to use browser - side JS to create a cookie, receive it with server - side PHP, and store in a cookie . jar file for use with PHP ' s curl library ? __label__4 I dislike feuds. What to do ? __label__4 <url> is one of the three fundamental Wikipedia content policies; why is it a "shame" you have to follow it? What did you mean by "people like you"?__label__4 Do you have perfect knowledge of the meetings before hand, ie who will be there and in what order the meetings occur? Or, do you have to process meetings as you get them ? __label__4 Did you see JzG <url> James Cantor that his alleged COI prohibits him from editing any BLPs related to his academic field? Didn ' t the AN discussion after the last round actually repudiate JzG ' s stance on this ? __label__4 All programming exercises apply to all languages. What are you asking ? __label__4 Aha! Can I also give you an answer which is not coded?? You and me need codes.. Okay ? __label__4 That was awfully quick, considering that it was open for less than 12 hours. Since I must now do them individually, must they be considered "Second Nominations" if I put them up again ? __label__4 @yossarian: Have you made this yet? How did it work out ? __label__4 Yeah, funny I ' d write that while looking at the book.. Wasnt Mitch McConnell Pres. Bush ' s chief of staff ? __label__4 I deliberately didn ' t mention memory constraints because I wanted to hear several ideas and then make a judgement about speed / memory tradeoff. Can you be more specific about lookup tables in this scenario ? __label__4 What ' s the point of subfeatures if you can ' t save them to a file? Is there some other format I can save that preserves subfeatures ? __label__4 Hot d * mn, this is more complicated than I thought at first. Week 1 is the week that contains the calendar year ' s first *Thursday*!?!__label__4 I will find religious advocacy statements. You don ' t understand, or disagree, that medical issues are over emphasized in the circumcision article ? __label__4 Re <url>: I reverted once. Shouldn ' t I get a cut of the proceeds ? __label__4 Why would a battery be less efficient with higher voltage? It ' s just a bigger number of same low - voltage cells, isn ' t it ? __label__4 What do you mean by prefix? Do you mean to add a prefix to all the entity class names ? __label__4 <url> Am I missing something ? __label__4 Are you using Perl 5? If you are, why are you writing for Perl 4 ? __label__4 I made the revert as an editor, not an Administrator - I haven ' t used my Admin tools and I have said I would not use them as I ' m involved. Where did I say I hadn ' t read any of the material ? __label__4 Changing your userpage doesn ' t answer my question. Why is your userpage a copy of <url>'s ? __label__4 So say a sample has size n = 400. Then you have one such sample of random variates from A, and 100 replicates each for B, C and D ? __label__4 i can input number, number1. skips to letter2 why ? __label__4 , and <url> hot. What more could a young man need ? __label__4 Lemme just remember, who ' s going to be mentioned first? Snyder, or the failed projects ? __label__4 I ' ve always been intrigued by 'dark - complected man.' What ' s with the radio, and fist in the air ? __label__4 What for did you analyse the two ArbCom cases Piotrus - Ghirla and Eastern European dispute? Was that suggested to you by Sciurinxe6 during your off - wiki discussions for 20 days ? __label__4 my edit was described as ''(Reverted 1 edit by 64 . 53 . 137 . 232 (talk): Rv. (TW))'' and I didn ' t give the guy a warning or anything so how would anyone think I was calling him a vandal ? __label__4 I ' ve updated the plugin a few times on numerous blogs and never had to re - enter the API Key. Do you have a similar issue with the Askimet plugin ? __label__4 What a mess. Does anything need to be done about it at the moment ? __label__4 And if you use Coulson you would probably have to say "According to Coulson..". Have you read <url> yet ? __label__4 There ' s an interesting discussion here: <url>. Care to explain ? __label__4 feel free to share the specifics of the space, it ' s quite relevant to the question. Is the space ' s shape odd, or is it hard to get to, or what ? __label__4 This seems to be an elementary / homework - level question. @mehas: could you please provide some motivation and explain why you are interested in this question ? __label__4 Emmy, Have you found a solution for this ? __label__4 It makes a difference if they are sorted in ascending or descending order. Which is it ? __label__4 How are recognizing and not recognising defined in this context? The country has explicitly and officially stated that they do or do not recognise the State of Palestine ? __label__4 Most of the books listed are more related to theoretical physics. I wonder if there is any "bible" for experimental physics ? __label__4 I notice that your userpage announces that this is an alternate account and won ' t get involved in policy. Did you always have that attitude, or is it since December last year ? __label__4 Did you restart the server? Why do you need to change it anyway - you can serve content in any locale ? __label__4 What ' s "Web of Knowledge"? Where is this "javascript form"?__label__4 I ' m guessing ruby, but let ' s make it clear. What language ? __label__4 Looks like you should have started your homework a bit earlier. What have you tried ? __label__4 I really would rather use, in English, the one expression "<url>" instead of "<url>," "marz," "<url>," "khaet," "<url>," "eparchia," "ostan," "khoueng," "faritany," "aimag," "tinh " u2014or "<url>" (aka "<url>"). <url> then why should "<url>" not be also ? __label__4 Any more incite from either of you? Or anyone else for that matter ? __label__4 There ' s no tab at the top of the page with a bold EDIT THIS PAGE on it. Is it just my computer ? __label__4 ED.. They have drugs to fix that now, don ' t they ? __label__4 No doubt, some comments are crazy. But getting rid of **all* comments ? __label__4 I was about to participate in the Afd on Wooster Greeks. You ' ve reverted yourself and re - closed it ? __label__4 @Metalshark, this question has not received any unique answers, and I believe is probably close enough to a duplicate to close. Any objections ? __label__4 Emico, you have to understand that sometimes people use different words to describe the same thing. If I find a source saying "Hitler killed himself" and I write "Hitler committed suicide" am I wrong because the word ''suicide'' isn ' t in the sources ? __label__4 This is what you wrote: "In the book 'Inventing Elliot' written by Graham Gardener, the book, 1948 is mentioned numerous times." What book, 1948??__label__4 I refer you to my last answer about independent sources. Do you have press coverage ? __label__4 What does this have to do with programming? Are you trying to solve this problem with a program ? __label__4 Then, I am curious. Why did you create the redirect in the first place ? __label__4 Dana, before I give the examples of what sections or parts in the article that needs fixing, I need to know if <url> is still gonna work on the problems. Do you get me ? __label__4 How come you have a need to to _ str on a name? Isn ' t a string already ? __label__4 Is this really notable? Time for an AfD nom ? __label__4 Not sure why I got <url> from you. Had I tagged it ? __label__4 There is a lot to learn - but to date I have concentrated on content, followed by style. If I have to keep removing silly comments, though, I will get discouraged - is there an easy way to reverse somebody ' s goofing ? __label__4 <url> apperantly we need a source..do you have one..??__label__4 He has requested unblock, states that he has edited from a school IP and that may be the reason for it. Who is he supposed to be a sock of, and what ' s the evidence ? __label__4 Debug adds lots of overhead to a program. Why are you assuming things are wrong ? __label__4 Concerning <url>, I must say I am a bit confused: isn ' t the article ' s title "Austria<span style="color : red">u2013</span>Hungary" (where, incidentally, it was moved after an "Austria<span style="color : red">-</span>Hungary" period)? It ' s really no big deal, but how can something be both correct and incorrect, and which standard are we at long last supposed to follow ? __label__4 You need to define your scope. Do you plan to use this on *many* words ? __label__4 Doubt it. Why do you have PHP source stored in a MySQL database ? __label__4 you have not provider the 11 , 21 , 31 code for that line. Can you provide dxf file so I can get a better look at it ? __label__4 you could have started the discussion yourself. How can you say there was no consensus against the edits if there had been no discussion at the time you were doing the reverting ? __label__4 I haven ' t done an 'official investigation' but perhaps it would be revealing. Alright then, save us the time..enlighten us--how many links have you added to WP that are owned by Stephen Barrett ? __label__4 I love the idea of getting a coffee when you ' re angry. Maybe you could mix it up occasionally and have a vodka + red bull ? __label__4 I have noticed that your objection to someone who unilaterally stops a straw poll. What, then, do you think of somebody who unilaterally ''starts'' a straw poll ? __label__4 Are you saying that you have a close or imtimate relationship with N . I.?__label__4 You made me work at that a little too hard. Next time, could you provide a link to the algorithm that you ' re using, or at least give us the name of the algorithm ? __label__4 You want to compress strings from argv, really? Or do you mean you want to treat argv ' s elements as names of files to compress, like gzip the program does ? __label__4 What are you trying with [Names init]; ??__label__4 and so is the new Portishead. Did I mention the Knife ? __label__4 Sounds like possible homework. What have you tried ? __label__4 It is fair use. And, I have no free alternative in the context of "Sugoroku Mutou." Now, why don ' t you find me a replacement picture in the context of "Japanese names," and I will accept the removal of the picture ? __label__4 As another aside, they are mostly Germans. What ' s up with that ? __label__4 Tell us what type of coating. Is it a dry whitish streaks or spots? Is it clear but has a texture ? __label__4 So what exactly is the problem? Changing the size doesn ' t work ? __label__4 sorry for the dumb question..one thing that I don ' t get is why /sites route and other routes in the documentation have **This method is new to version 1 . 1** description. Is it new or just updated ? __label__4 I hate that they give no choices for being anonymous. Why do I have to use my real full name to sign up ? __label__4 maybe a bit harsh to close this. drop the last two sentences and it ' s an OK q, no ? __label__4 Extended Attributes will allow you to set some very liberal access permissions, and tell them to propagate inside the directory, and continue to do so on new creations, but for the life of me I can ' t find instructions. I can only do it on OSX Servers using the Server Admin Tools, which I assume is not a viable option here ? __label__4 I will take out Haskett in deference to you. OK ? __label__4 That sounds like an old domain parking page. Does "Fetch as Googlebot" give you any response to the /robots . txt ?__label__4 Okay, I have built a radar system before, I need one major thing, that I am not sure if you intended to answer. Do you plan to do this at a single frequency ? __label__4 User 86 . 138 . 232 . 97 does have a history of malicous edits. Are you then confirming that these malicious edits done by user 86 . 138 . 232 . 97 were done by yourself ? __label__4 Please answer Bishonen question to you. When were you invited to comment on UC related subjects ? __label__4 As I said in the summary when moving him away from <url>, for the last twenty - six years of his life he wasn ' t a priest. Perhaps I ' ve missed the part of the naming convention which requires 'priest', could you please say more ? __label__4 When someone explicitly states that they created the image themselves, then surely GFDL is at least implied? I know i forgot to add the tag but is it really necessary to put a delete template on the image ? __label__4 Your current solution may work but doesn ' t make sense to do it that way just so you can skip typing a class name. What is the problem with using the class name ? __label__4 I ' m sure the error says more than that. What else does it say ? __label__4 Does it do anything other than deselect it? That seems a little redundant, why not just uncheck the checkbox ? __label__4 I am the third party; <url> was the first to dispute its use. Why can ' t you describe the changes in words ? __label__4 I couldn ' t tell you why glam rock was there. Better ? __label__4 This is a bit tricky to answer. Does combinatorics fall outside classical mathematics ? __label__4 I think you need some more examples, cause I still don ' t understand what you ' re trying to do. What about longer arrays and a different number of elements to select ? __label__4 I was wondering, why did you do that, create that new cat and then add it to the polanski without any discussion at all? Have you read the polanski talkpage and seen the lengthy discussion regarding the cats there ? __label__4 If you ' re talking about the Recycling Troll, I ' ve never blocked him. Why do you think I have ? __label__4 Have you visited <url>??__label__4 How is the result of your code different from that shown in the article? What, exactly, are you asking for help with ? __label__4 Hi reinyday - I ' ve been noticing your sig on WP : CFD.. this is probably something you know all about but.. you do know about being able to use four tildes (<nowiki>~~</nowiki>) to sign, don ' t you? Or have you done some fancy trick with your signature to stop it linking back to your user page ? __label__4 Wait, I ' m confused. Aren ' t you already a moderator ? __label__4 Girne. Sen ? __label__4 Is this really about physics? I can see why it ' s a valid question, and I can see there ' s physics behind it, but is the question itself about physics ? __label__4 Eh. Awesome as in you are going to be more active ? __label__4 Well, that ' s probably going to be an annoying AfD. How about <url> and <url>?__label__4 Eeerr.. Could you type a little slower, I am having trouble with the above!?__label__4 Well, for a start, why is this irreplaceable? He ' s still alive, so what ' s to stop someone taking a picture and releasing it under a free license ? __label__4 what is the & sign for? why do it ? __label__4 Please do not remove warnings. Just follow the rules and everyone will get along, ok ? __label__4 Unicode contains only four double - struck Greek letters: ℽℼℾℿ (γπΓΠ), and since the Unicode repertoire is quite comprehensive (and much larger than the Comprehensive Symbols List), I ' d conjecture that this character is very uncommon. Could you give an example where this character is used ? __label__4 Yes, I appreciate that my edits were not the best, but they are currently the best available in Wikipedia for guiding readers in understanding there the emergence of the legal systems of the United Kingdom. Do You have a better suggestion ? __label__4 Hi, I noticed <url> of yours, claiming a <url> violation. Mind explaining that ? __label__4 Soo, what ' s the problem? Do you get an error when trying to compile the code ? __label__4 Hi RHM22. Would you or one of your coin - loving compatriots have access to <url>?__label__4 Making edits vanish without a trace would be ''extremely'' difficult to do u2013 only full <url> could do that, and I can assure you the oversighters wouldn ' t do such a thing just to allow somebody to cover their tracks. Maybe you are mis - remembering something, about edits that were in fact on some other page ? __label__4 Sorry, but I dont understand. How should I check ?__label__4 I don ' t think anybody wants the stale uninformative old Victorian results infoboxes. Can you gain consensus before deviating ? __label__4 Not a trivial task for homework. Did you not get any advice from the teacher on how to proceed ? __label__4 Do you mean it literally says "Unknown Sender?" Or the number is just unfamiliar to you ? __label__4 Why do you need to do this? Why is having the row id sequential important and necessary ? __label__4 While browsing wikipedia for missing pages to write i saw it on your things to do list. Assuming he ' s a poet, do you mean <url>?__label__4 I see where someone put "April Fool ' s" in a revision, but otherwise, there was no other humor included, the page was utilitarian otherwise, and you can ' t move a category (meaning I would have to delete it anyway). Do we ''really'' need to retain this ? __label__4 You are doing a regex match but not checking whether it succeeded or using its results in any way. What change to you want to happen to `$name`?__label__4 Usually you don ' t get answers, if you don ' t show effort of solving things by yourself first. So, what are your thoughts, what is your proposed solution, what is clear and what is unclear to you ? __label__4 So, does the above comment imply that the answer to the OP ' s question is 'No such examples can be constructed.'? Or perhaps, some pathological example exists which violates the assumptions behind admissibility ? __label__4 All right, I ' ll bite. Is honorary membership in the Justice League not criteria enough for being listed in that category ? __label__4 Helped them do what? Leave Israel ? __label__4 @edA - qa mort - ora - y: Why instead of saying *I want it POD* do you not state what is it that you need? Why is it that you are so interested in having it be a POD ? __label__4 Fair enough on the general murder victims. But Kriss Donald was British, was he not ? __label__4 Isn ' t this a way to rephrase: "Fast, Good or Cheap. Pick Two" ?__label__4 You said ''"undo. Raggz, you added the tag and THEN mentioned it on talk- you did not gain consensus first or even wait for anyone to discuss it."'' Is consensus required to add a tag ? __label__4 The flag "visible=yes" means a comment on the page is made visible, not that the page is visible in search engines. Why did you remove flag ? __label__4 Why would you build your own XML parser at all? Is this just to learn javaCC ? __label__4 And the username? Do you have any thoughts on changing it to something not involving Nazism ? __label__4 You ' re missing a paren. Is that the problem ? __label__4 It helps if you mention what operating system you ' re using. It is Ubuntu, Debian, or something else ? __label__4 Yet you did violate <url> and could be blocked right now. If that edit recurred, would you revert it again ? __label__4 Who is this Brit you keep talking about? A past vandal or something ? __label__4 Avinash: Below, you rejected Levenshtein as "slow". So your idea of "best" must include performance, too, no ? __label__4 I usually just boil water and then drink but I think it won ' t help here. Does it ? __label__4 I ' ve yet to see a single keyword from the Fortran language in this question. Could you post a minimum size example of fortran code which gives this kind of error, along with what you did to generate it, instead of guessing on the source of the problems ? __label__4 Might i also add that enabling iPad features in an iPhone app target seems silly. Why don ' t you do it properly and make the iPhone app a universal binary (iPad+iPhone) ?__label__4 Better is entirely subjective with nothing more specific. What do you photograph, what are your priorities ? __label__4 Why can ' t you just split every job to three equal sized parts (e . g. 100 = 33 + 33 + 334) and always run only one job at a time, and through all the three lines ? __label__4  " If any database errors occur, they will be emailed to the address specified here." Do u get any emails??__label__4 You ' re going to have to be more specific about what you want to know. What kind of platform are you using to implement these algorithms ? __label__4 I Mean hes been really sucessful why not??__label__4 Variables should be extremely common, so why do you have to modify the most common with a $? Shouldn ' t something else get the $?__label__4 Picking up your challenge. You a big fan of skittles or something ? __label__4 No. Distribued between what and what? Are those numbers independent or not ? __label__4 `self` is reserved? Are you sure about that ? __label__4 I ' m confused. You don ' t have the original assets ?__label__4 Man, I ' m discovering that Commons is lousy with copyrighted product packaging, there are ''thousands'' of them, I think. I am AWB - challenged, if I start compiling a list, perhaps you could eventually turn AWB loose on it ? __label__4 Also, the last time you asked this, 100 worked but 190 didn ' t work. Why the change ? __label__4 My job. Do you have any specific points to address ? __label__4 That code works fine for me. What does your **actual** code look like ? __label__4 Are you saying that Racepacket attempted to contact Laura ' s employer? When and where did this happen ? __label__4 I dont understand "Toeing in Will" and by brake calipers, do you mean brake pads ? __label__4 @Vlad: then why is there a problem? If you make each tile say 5 bytes (that 1 byte + entityID) and every entity contains it ' s position, then everything is O ( 1) right ? __label__4 I ' ve also started <url>. Now is this acceptable ? __label__4 Well it looked as though it had stopped, certainly tapered off for a few days but now some bloody wanker has started adding it again. I don ' t suppose you know how to get a page protected, I ' ve never had to do it before ? __label__4 What do you mean by 'documents'? Something that looks like a report or just a spreadsheet full of numbers ? __label__4 One to go. Shouldn ' t "now welcome" be "not welcome"?__label__4 Please clear some questions I have about your question: Are you looking to self - host your document management solution or are you wanting do create a knowledge base *about* self - hosted apps ? __label__4  # I am still convinced the long page on "prostatitis" (a misnomer in the case of CPPS) is confusing, with too many sections and subsections, and would benefit from restructuring and the creation of separate pages for each area, or at the very least the removal of the CPPS section to its own, in depth page. You were the only editor to object to this going ahead, with this comment: "So, suggest keep this on hold for now, but in principle one might similarly split off other classification categories with this then just umbrella simple introduction." Do you still hold this view ? __label__4 So, let me make sure I understand this. You think that, if we remove an image as it does not meet the NFCC, you would then be able to upload the same image, only this time, it would meet the NFCC ? __label__4 Damn it! Should we just revert back to the beginning of the day, since what I wrote was based on analyzing the satellite data ? __label__4 I ' ve just started seeing this same problem after the latest Froyo OTA upgrade. Maybe that ' s related ? __label__4  " Use images for transactions"?? Do you mean that you want to use images to represent certain info on the screen ? __label__4 @zr: **How is 0x5f7ff "even" but 0x5f800 is not?** What exactly do you mean by *nearest even*?__label__4 You can narrow this down a bit; are you on a mountain bike? A road bike? A 16" folding bike ? __label__4 By "this project" I mean Wikipedia. Do you share the values of civility and consensus ? __label__4 And <url> targets <url>. Shouldn ' t it go to <url>?__label__4 Im interested in where you got the information you added stating woodlands house was closed in 2003. As far as i can see your wording was taken from one website, the milesfaster one. Should you not cite the website you quoted rather than look for a couple of others ? __label__4 What..? How are these related ? __label__4 ..to Giggy ' s RfA. Did you mean to remove 2 , 066 bytes of replies ? __label__4 I suppose I should not have used rollback. I was aware of the problem, but you had not solved it, had you ? __label__4 I ' m sure there is, along with a million other clever optimizations. But I really doubt they ' re caching the *results* of my search, so I ' m still curious - what algorithm are they using to actually obtain the result list ? __label__4 @Matthew Why not just use an existing hashtable implementation? Why do you need a custom hash ? __label__4 You recently edited this page. It is my view that this page is just a corporate marketing listing, there are several hundred companies that do the same job yet are not listed in Wikipedia - Do you not think that this is advertorial ? __label__4 Many thanks for the review. So what was the truce term ''you'' used when little then ? __label__4 Could this be sublimed to something that is best described as a development manifesto? Is that what we should, essentially, be looking for ? __label__4 The reason given on the <nowiki><person></nowiki> tag (''"Non - notable book promo"'') seems to have nothing at all to do with the article. Is this on the correct article ? __label__4 Hmm. So **We ' ve a long way to go** in the UK, before we reach US linguistic standards? I know Americans favour inserting *got* there, but is that a closely - observed rule ? __label__4 I have no need to search the interwebs, all that matters is it offends people and is a violation of NPOV and MoS. "All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views (that have been published by reliable sources)" - ess - eff is a bias term for a minority group of fans, put it this way: is there an SF - channel, or how often is the clichxe9 ess - eff used outside fan - groups ? __label__4 @Frog: Your question is only slightly clearer now. Is the general rule "xyz" -> "myXyz"?__label__4 What ' s the processor? What have you done yourself to answer the question ? __label__4 Why aren ' t you just doing this . startActivity ( intent)? Can you post the logcat ? __label__4 Where did you get the file from? What is the name / extension of the file ? __label__4 Who is this StriplingWarrior? Why he / she edit my question ? __label__4 you ' re gonna need to explain what you mean a little better. Is this even a programming question or are you trying to figure out how yahoo mail works ? __label__4 uh, okay lol :) no, i dont think i am (although i dont remember drinking any at all..), and um? okay ? __label__4 I presume you haven ' t obliterated them completely, because that would be to be editorialise enormously. Where have you put them instead ? __label__4 Just curious, who asked a question like that? Did you apply for a math heavy position without knowing what FFT is, or did you apply for a "normal" job and they asked you this ? __label__4 You mean the OS - specific printing interface? How can the OS - specific printing API be magically OS independent ? __label__4 @Nick Usually they are <div class="section"> but sometimes there are other classes. Does that matter ? __label__4 See my comments on the article ' s talk page, which is on my watchlist by the way. Be bold ? __label__4 I have listened to the beginning for your recording of Thomas Jefferson and nothing is mentioned that Thomas Jefferson owned slaves or Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings. Why ? __label__4 Its been over a week now and I see you still haven ' t passed or failed the article. Made a decision ? __label__4 hmm.. wait a minute.. hmm.. what?!__label__4 Is there a reason you didn ' t accept the answer? Is there something wrong with it ? __label__4 Hi, Why were the images <url> from the infobox in <url>? Is this part of an MOS or something ? __label__4 We need no code to reverse a string. And, who would need a reversed string anyway ? __label__4 You are removing the film poster s images from the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards articles and the Academy awards. Why ? __label__4 Are you running a dedicated server with your own VMs, or do you have one VM provided by a hosting company? Or are you talking about vhosts in regard of apache being multi - homed ? __label__4 There are ways, but to be honest this seems like a bad idea. Why do you want to do this ? __label__4 @felix, why? isn ' t he just creating an new object ? __label__4 I am totally and completely baffled by what is meant by "not one that happens every Thurs evening at the local church, but rather the big store". What is "the big store"?__label__4 Why not just use the onmousedown event as a trigger for whatever you ' re attempting to do instead? (What are you trying to achieve?)__label__4 You just created that article - but maybe you haven ' t noticed there ' s already <url>, which covers the same character set, as the ISO followed the Thai standard. Maybe you should merge your additions there, and make TIS - 620 a redirect ? __label__4 I notice that you added a period to the middle of a sentence in the article about <url>. Why ? __label__4 Hey Geek Could U pls guide me to start learning the basics of flurry analytics in android? Where can i find its tutorial kind of things ? __label__4 Since there ' s different tricks and none is the one right answer, shouldn ' t this be a community wiki ? __label__4 Why did you remove those German emigrant cases. Shouldn ' t we include those cases of people who was born in what was then Germany at the time ? __label__4 There are not many ready - made exploits for max excel out there, at least not in non - commercial exploit packs. Which version of office do you have ? __label__4 I need an answer to this question, but I cannot see which question it is meant to be a duplicate of. Where do I see that ? __label__4 Let me know what you ' d like me to do. Are you / anyone thinking of copying over the temporary copy wholesale or in parts; destroying the edit history of either, both or neither..?__label__4 Could you ask a specific question? What have you tried so far ? __label__4 Actually, I thought that I was moving to the end of the list. I must be missing what is the issue with putting a (revised) picture at the end of the list ? __label__4 What do you mean 'same operation'? Is @myArray shared ? __label__4 Yeah, I ' m not sure that I care one way or another, but the 3RR is clearly incorrect. And what happened to <url>?__label__4 Why did you remove the pollution references on <url>. Do you have a source which refutes this claim ? __label__4 What "fact" that was recently prooved is referred to? And since when is pi the ratio of circumference to radius, rather than circumference to diameter ? __label__4 If you are insecure about your pet IDE being criticized, then by all means, step up and defend it. How do I define a custom key binding in eclipse ? __label__4 @MAK: Well, there is a problem **what order to store in**, and then there is a solution that specifies one way to solve the problem with its own advantages and disadvantages. Not `algorithm` -worthy ? __label__4 I have no axe to grind on this issue; I just want to understand: Why you consider hammerpond . org . uk a spam or conflict of interest link? It doesn ' t seem to be advertising or promoting anything ? __label__4 One of your edits concerns me - <url>. Maybe a copyedit would be good, but was it really required to be deleted completely ? __label__4 I ' ve noticed that you ' re engaged in several edit wars, with Meliniki, regarding minor alterations to multiple Greek language articles. Perhaps you should consider discussing the changes on Meliniki ' s <url> instead ? __label__4 And you logged in here how? What ' s with the fake questions ? __label__4 what error did you get (exception / error message) ? what exactly do you want to achieve when you say "merging" 2 PNG ?__label__4 What page is this? Why was it deleted ? __label__4 Thanks for reverting that obnoxious vandalism on my talk page. How do I bring in an administrator to deal with the vandal ? __label__4 @Koper, in order to program this algorithm, I need to understand what the algorithm does. How is it *not* related to programming ? __label__4  [ This thread](http://forum . archosfans . com / viewtopic . php ? f=35 & t=17511) on an archos 5 mentions turning off the "static IP" setting on the device. Does your device have that setting ? __label__4 I ' m wondering why you ' ve removed this category from <url>'s page? Is he no longer part of the council ? __label__4 And: what does "choppy" mean exactly? Could http://ww . learningjquery . com / 2009 / 01 / quick - tip - prevent - animation - queue - buildup help ? __label__4 I don ; t like commons because when i try to link things in the description it never works because it links only to commons. what is that ? __label__4 Alright, the NPOV template is even worse, since it specifically points people to a talk page discussion which does not exist. Why are you adding these templates ? __label__4 Do you want the actual algorithm, or a clue (ie. some kind of homework help)?__label__4 Why do you contend that New Atheism and Atheism 3 . 0 are unrelated? They are so intermingled that people have difficulty discerning which is which ? __label__4 Well, I suppose it is only reasonable for you to conclude that everyone behaves as you and your allies do. If "good typography" is whatever Dicklyon likes, why shouldn ' t the truth be whatever subserves Dicklyon ' s cause ? __label__4 Why you undid mi edition??__label__4 Which link are you referencing? Anyway, TTN, that another phony or is that you on WikiQuote ? __label__4 You have an unbalanced double quote. Where does your quote end ? __label__4 anyone! Any ideas ? __label__4 I was checking out the article on the Unitarian Society in Fall River that you contributed to, and there ' s a lot that was wrong. I want to reconcile what you know with what I know so we can get this article right.. a little help here ? __label__4 I ' ve come to state that I find it mildly amusing that you don ' t consider a press release for a journalism award from Columbia University to be a "substantial story from a citable source". Isn ' t Columbia among the world ' s most prestigious journalism schools ? __label__4 Your <url> give your first edit as on April 9, 2011. Do you have any other account you have not disclosed yet ? __label__4 You may not remember doing this but, you erased a page entitled, Earl Newton. Why did you do it ? __label__4 ??__label__4 Is there any point though? If the image is already the correct size ? __label__4 Your new images of Micheal Knight and Devon look kinda squashed. Can you fix them or find better ones to replace them ? __label__4 You can place islands so there is no path between points. What should happen then ? __label__4 This question does not seem to make sense. You say both ends are routers, so assuming you set the routes correctly, and the routers are gateways, what is the question ? __label__4 Defined "central point"? Do you want any point within a convex hull around the points, the geometric center, or what ? __label__4 What error? Why do you need `@` before `mysqli _ query`?__label__4 Why would your 8 pts be in a 1 / 3 cube? Why not a 1 / 2 cube or a 9 / 10ths cube ? __label__4 I don ' t really get the logic. What ' s similar about [2] and [5] and what ' s equal about titles..?__label__4 Trust me, I have not. But when you create an app that is your own work from the ground up, don ' t you wanna dot the 'i ' s ? __label__4 Flush ? Do you mean flash ?__label__4 Hey Love, as you wish, if you have any suggestions about my section, let me know. Is English a second language for you ? __label__4 The water . mapcalc file should be rather straightforward. However, probably the white space in the directory name causes troubles ? __label__4 I don ' t understand what your question is. Where are you stuck ? __label__4 Why is your `i` loop going from `j : 6`, rather than `1 : 6`? Have you noticed that `sum` is being recalculated on every iteration (overwriting the value from the previous iteration)?__label__4 What exactly are you asking? Are you asking for good examples for books to use, good things to try while learning, or just our opinion about the difficulty of examples ? __label__4 You just added it again. Maybe you should look over the guidelines for inclusion of the tag ? __label__4 Have you tried? How? Some code ? __label__4 Acad, at <url> the article suddenly starts talking about ''Pomone'' without any context - is this a typo? You ' re a major contributor - can you clarify ? __label__4 What is your definition of a "small change" in the output? Edit distance (treating hashes as strings) or mathematical distance of numbers (treating hashes as integers?)__label__4 I only used approved templates. If they are not considered polite, why have them ? __label__4 ya it is! am i not supposed to ask hw questions here ? __label__4 Fatwa? What is that ? __label__4 Could you clarify what you mean by "go into"? Why don ' t you explain what you want to happen ? __label__4 Sorry about not being clear, but I was talking about an idealised case where air resistance is negligible and the tires are perfectly rigid and there is no internal friction at play. So, then why is it 0 ? __label__4 Are you actually wanting to know? Or are you telling me to include that information on the photographs page ? __label__4 Also, what time are you synchronising? And why ? __label__4 Yes, but the w doesn ' t have to be 2. What then ? __label__4 You mean other than when things like taste, heat tolerance, health, etc are factors? Or is that what you are asking ? __label__4 I note also that so far you seem to be the sole editor who favors deletion, while several have favored retention of the article, possibly with editing. Could it be that your view does not command consensus ? __label__4 I don ' t get it. How can you want to find the "highest value" while at the same time not caring how a comparison is done ? __label__4 The reason given on the <nowiki><person></nowiki> tag (''"Non - notable book promo"'') seems to have nothing at all to do with the article. Is this on the correct article ? __label__4 Would you be so kind as to show a schematic of your receiver? Are you supplying the bias voltage of 1 . 9 V ? __label__4 Never heard of this before. I guess you ' ve already tried a full repair and it ' s still happening ? __label__4 @leppie so this is ambigious? Why? Because of the loop ? __label__4 You speedy - delete - tagged <url> and <url> as <nowiki><person></nowiki>. What maintenance work were you weanting to do with them ? __label__4 somthing missing in your question! what forms you want to turn to ? __label__4 er, no that wont work. It wud still complain about that error, wont it ? __label__4 @astony: *in a single step, you could transfer at least one point from element to its neighbours*. Do you mean **at most**?__label__4 I advance (Ultra - Orthodox) Rabbi Dr Mordechai Halperin, (Ultra - Orthodox), Rabbi Gershon Winkler, (Conservative) Rabbi Elliot Dorff, to you, for example, that the Torah and Talmud only forbids anal sex. Now explain exactly what division of Judaism is left, for you to claim your view fairly represents ? __label__4 I ' m not clear on something. Is this taking place _before_ or _after_ the hatches are open ? __label__4 O ( n) is trivial. Is it possible to do this faster ? __label__4 Not that clear to me. What ' s wrong with this username ? __label__4 I give a glimpse there now and then. What is up ? __label__4 What City in Connecticut do you live in? And have you been to the north as your name suggests ? __label__4 I have no idea what to tag this. Ideas ? __label__4 Track users? Keep statistics on what ? __label__4 Any word on what happened to it? Did you get a chance to talk to your instructor ? __label__4 What is a metapackage? Is it a format ? __label__4 Hi. With only a little over one day remaiming and <url> not editing and not contributing to the case as yet are there to be any known deviations from the standard procedure ? __label__4 Die Person, die Probleme macht, ist jetzt in Schwierigkeiten. Vielleicht seit langem ? __label__4 He used it to assert that ''others'' had expressed the notion that the process was concluded and that it was time to move on, and used your statement as evidence of this. Since you did not mean that it had been concluded, and since obviously you were only speaking for yourself and no one else, and participants have been continuing to post on the RfC page and its Talk Page to indicate that they do not feel this way at all, how does it serve to support the idea that they have ? __label__4 In this <url> there was a loss of some info. Was that intentional ? __label__4 Please elaborate on "doesn ' t seem to be accurately answered". What did you try and what happened when you did ? __label__4 Why do you need to do another `ls`? Why don ' t you just print the results from the first `ls`?__label__4 I have read (on http://ww . mathjax . org / docs / 1 . 1 / installation . html) that Firefox ' s same - origin policy might slow the loading of `mathjax`. Does anyone know how I might install `mathjax` locally on my windows XP machine ? __label__4 You are moved <url>. You know that ''major warship'' is clasification in <url>s ?__label__4 What do you mean by "equivalent value"?? Are you just looking for a linear function like that in @phimuemue ' s answer ? __label__4 I notice that to the <url> and <url> pages edited ''Gorka'' ''Josxe9 Unda Velasco'' and changed it to simply ''Gorka''. Why ? __label__4 1. what are your pedals and why such pedals? 2. Any idea what load an aluminium bike can stand on touring ? __label__4 Read beyond the obvious. What is that essay saying when you remove all referances to users under blocks, bans or other sanctions ? __label__4 Innovative? You mean, something that uses genetic algorithms that cloud compute on quantum computers ? __label__4 If you ' re not going to reply then I will undo the edit. Again, why have "Fictional martial artists" over the sub - cat "Anime and manga martial artists" and not use alphabetical order ? __label__4 You recently uploaded <url> as being in the public domain as its copyright was not renewed. Does the book indicate that its copyright was not renewed or do you have any other reason to believe that the L . A. Times did not renew the copyright ? __label__4 where are you viewing the records?? are you sure they are not stored well ? __label__4 i am not getting you, and where is the link ? __label__4 ??__label__4 Are there integers? and can they repeat within a set ? __label__4 Hmm.. this seems like a chemistry question to me (and therefore quite possibly off - topic for this site). Thoughts from anyone else ? __label__4 What do you mean *excluding the $ and $*? What $ and $?__label__4 Wait a minute! I ' ve done plenty of good edits, where did they all go ? __label__4 If input is {{a: 1, b: 1}, {c: 1}, {b: 1, c: 1}}, do you just want {{a: 1, b: 1} , {c: 1}}, or all 3? If it ' s the former, what exactly do you need this for ? __label__4 Why do you want to use those? What are you trying to do ? __label__4 @Sorin: If it ' s just a simple script, then why do you need "syntactic sugar" at all? Is it pure vanity (*"..but I want it to work this way because it looks much nicer"*) or is there any technical reason that you cannot simply use the methods that are already there ? __label__4 I don ' t have the delete privilege assigned to my account. What are you talking about ? __label__4 ..and, really, BeeGees? And not Peter Frampton ? __label__4 Can you please clarify your question so it ' s clear what you ' re asking for. Do you want examples of functional and non - functional requirements in the problem specification ? __label__4 What exactly is your concern? Is it the fact that you can ' t reach the shifter with your hands on the bars? Or the fact that it ' s not indexed? Or something else ? __label__4 define 'normal stovetop' .. gas or electric ?__label__4 What ' s the purpose of this? How do you want to use them ? __label__4 Email checked and responded to. If you can ' t respond here, could you at least leave me a note to check my email ? __label__4 Is your problem that you don ' t know why the cost of the cycle 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 is 37? Or is it that you don ' t know how to do the backtracking ? __label__4 Can you please elaborate a bit? Like write few - word intro to those algorithms ? __label__4 Its not "really" fast, it just runs at a normal rate. Ever heard of the saying, in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king ? __label__4 <url>.. it doesn ' t really explain what the issue was. Can you word it better ? __label__4 Speaking of FPC closures, is it common practice to close the likes of the Emu feeding video or the White Ibis, which had nothing but weak supports and supports (not enough total votes, but that was all) as "Not Promoted"? Isn ' t that what the "Nominations 7 days or older - Decision Time" section is for ? __label__4 You have given your point by point rebuttals to my reasons several times. How can you say I haven ' t provided my reasoning ? __label__4 Where exactly are you stuck? What doesn ' t work ? __label__4 You ' ll need to store something server - side. And I don ' t get what 'stand - alone' means in this case, how will it access the URL then ? __label__4 Just move <url> to <url>. And shouldn ' t the clean - up parameter be added to <url> also to make it work ? __label__4 The sum divided by 4 results in 6 minutes. How do you get 8 minutes ? __label__4 Also, u201ccould be expectedu201d? By whom ? __label__4 Could we have a question concerning the GPL without discussions about whether the GPL is good or bad sometime? Please ? __label__4 The question isn ' t clear. Is it a video of two stars in the sky ? __label__4 Thats good. Do you have any enemies on here as well ? __label__4 Transport protocol right above the data link layer? You sure ? __label__4 *"I ' m developing a Java desktop application that is to be used with Ubuntu."* What is the attraction of coding in Java when only targeting one OS ? __label__4 Just a bit of feedback: assuming that this is the same question as your recent directed - acyclic - network before, it seems much clearer now. -- How ' s your linear algebra ? __label__4 How exactly is a one - time martial arts tournament, all of whose participants are red - links, notable? Is Wikipedia to have separate articles for every martial arts tournament ever broadcast on television ? __label__4 I was under the impression that higher temperatures caused even more carcinogens.

Is there any way to find the original proposal and / or artical, or has it just been sent to oblivion ? __label__4 Sorry, I didn ' t think about 20x hashed md5, so it isn ' t 36 ^ 32 but 19 * 36 ^ 32 + unknown lenght, characters, salt in last md5 hash. Am I right ? __label__4 Why do you need to take factorials of such large numbers? What will you do with the results ? __label__4 Where are you sorting `dateArray`? Or you aren ' t doing it right now ? __label__4 Is this format safe? Does it remove also hidden partitions, if any ? __label__4 Due to the different interpretations people have of "independent", can you please clarify your question. What do you mean by independent ? __label__4 Your formatting makes it seem like your perl script actually calls each line in tick marks.

Or it doesn ' t matter ? __label__4 Hey, what was with the fact tag? Do you dispute its name ? __label__4 I believe that an opinion about AS belongs only to article about AS (and you are welcome to cite the MS opinion ''in proper context''). However an opinion about MS belongs only to article about MS. Is not this fair and logical ? __label__4 I ' m curious how you justify your removal of a link to the Washington Blade newspaper website in the <url> article<url>. The Blade is a valid media outlet - a newspaper dating back to 1969. Is there some bias at work ? __label__4 For one phonological citation I need an uppercase "I", as in "Italy", with _serifs_ to distinguish it from lowercase L. You advised "The Classic skin uses a serifed font, if you can accept a personal solution." I ' m sorry, I don ' t catch your meaning. Where do I find the Classic skin, what is a personal solution, and why wouldn ' t I accept it ? __label__4 I see that you closed that CfD discussion as rename, but haven ' t actually renamed the categories. What ' s up with that ? __label__4 According to ''Nature'' <url>, the picture is xa9 Zhongda Zhang / IVPP (IVPP is the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in China). What evidence do you have that we have permission to use it ? __label__4 @ANdrea: I don ' t that is right. What if all the numbers were negative ? __label__4 One the the main reasons I ask for a citation is to learn precisely what is meant by "the consistency of the reals". You haven ' t heard anything about this, Trovatore, have you ? __label__4 I thought that only section tags go into sections while the article tags go to the top of the page so they could serve it ' s purpose. Is there a Wikipedia guideline that can substantiate your revert ? __label__4 Arora and Barak ' s textbook on computational complexity covers derandomization fairly well. Did you have something else in mind ? __label__4  " doing math on the file as if it were one long number" sounds like a bad idea! What method is this ? __label__4 When you say "cover the chicken", specifically how and with what do you do that ? __label__4 is this a kind of Homework? and put some code that you have tried ?__label__4 You parsed XML using JSON parsing? Why??__label__4 Anupam, the etymology of ''chand raat'' Sanskritic, as stated in article is basically correct. Is there an issue ? __label__4 I know what the band Rush is. I ' m just wondering if you were joking or didn ' t know the user was referring to Rush Limbaugh ? __label__4 And it ''takes'' thousands and thousands of dollars to run a campaign, so exactly what ' s your point? Has there actually been some evidence of wrongdoing on anyone ' s part ? __label__4 <url>! Shall we greet him as he deserves ? __label__4 Sounds like 'can anyone show me how to iterate over array and execute function on each element'. What ' s the problem with iterating it step by step, just as you described ? __label__4 Just to let you know, there ' s a <url> now. I don ' t know, is this mimicry allowed on Wikipedia ? __label__4 I tried this for some of the code but immediately ran into problems - the code for some reason it went over the book ' s margins. Please take a look here: http://i . imgur . com / 7S9cE . png Any ideas how to make it wrap nicely ? __label__4 Still, I cannot understand why virtually all boxes related to the EU were removed. What makes this issue more divisive than for example the re - unification of Yugoslavia ? __label__4 having trouble grokking those first couple paragraphs. Edit ? __label__4 @brian Actually, yes. Is that possible without causing the "world to burn"?__label__4 If the Russia tricolor is not the flag of the Lokot Autonomy, than what is? Is the flag even available on Wikipedia ? __label__4 Is this like a printing error on a postage stamp, i . e. a rarity ? __label__4 I also have problems with a lot of the other recategorisation you have done to these articles, but I won ' t revert any more until I hear from you. Taking <url> as an example: why have you removed it from <url> when it clearly is a linear filter; why remove it from <url> when it forms part of image parameter theory; why does an article which discusses electronic designs not belong in <url>; why remove it from <url> when, obviously, it is a term ? __label__4 Since each polygon would overlay a polygon of the exact same shape, you really won ' t glean any benefit (that I can think of) from having multiple shapes. Are you doing this for something other than symbolizing features on a map ? __label__4 Less than 127? Don ' t you mean "Less or equal to 127"?__label__4 Wow that ' s old! What do you think of <url>?__label__4 Seems to be down again. I assume this is nothing I can resurrect on my own when you have intermittent Internet access like this ? __label__4 I solved the problem, and I can assure you it is trivial. Is it homework or not ? __label__4  " invertHash", I suppose. But honestly, why does it matter what you name your own functions ? __label__4 Touched upon in [Do All Adverbs End in "-Ly"?](http://grammar . quickanddirtytips . com / do - all - adverbs - end - in - ly . aspx), section "What Are Flat Adverbs?".__label__4 What ' s wrong with it? Isn ' t making a wordpress theme programming ? __label__4 <url>: I am not sure how a regular spy mission gone bad had contributed to the history of cryptography. Should every spy ship, listening post, tampered cable and what not get included in the category ? __label__4 Which software? which version ? __label__4 Also, why is this glorious photo of a <url> not used in any articles? Was there some argument about its copyright status ? __label__4 Why is the clause changing every time? Why don ' t you post your best attempt and we ' ll look at it ? __label__4 I still don ' t understand what you want to do. What do you mean by "reorder the sequence in which the pixel intensity data comes"?__label__4 Hi, sorry I think I ' m missing something here. Why are you adding a red link to the vandalism page ? __label__4 Granted, it wouldn ' t be terribly difficult for me to recreate what I did, but I don ' t like doing extra work when I don ' t have to. Could you at least userfy the last version edited by me ? __label__4 What is a `peek()` method? What is it you want, exactly ? __label__4 I assume you were directing these comments to Malcolm, who was reverted by multiple people (and who blatantly violated the 3RR, as pointed out on his talk page). Correct ? __label__4 <url> seems a bit bizarre. Why nowrap date fields in cite templates ? __label__4 can you really fix velocity and number of vehicles and vary the area? It does not look like it is possible to do controlled experiment in your case, can you please clarify ? __label__4 Looks like he earned a block. He break the 3RR rule ? __label__4 Editing pattern just means, have you made more than 3R in 24h. Why should S get blocked, when S didn ' t break 3RR ? __label__4 Do you mind if you tell me why do you add duplicate links to the article? More specifically, why do you add internal links to the See Also sections when those links are already in the article navbox ? __label__4 Crossover with ''30 Days of Night''?! wow..link ? __label__4 What makes you think that this is the reason for the memory usage diff? Are your results repeatable ? __label__4 @hippietrail: Truncated how? and on what OS ? __label__4 Hi, Jpa! Why not archive the old discussions on your talk page ? __label__4 I just tried an empty field in Lightroom 3, and it seems to be working as you & I would expect: all photos without a setting on that field are being included. Is there a chance some other setting on your collection is tripping it up ? __label__4 It might depend on your messaging app -- HTC phones with Sense don ' t have the standard android mesages app, for example. What phone do you have ? __label__4 This is clearly them being just as congenial and accurate as always.<url> What is the appropriate place to report them ? __label__4 When were closures for JDK 7 cancelled? You have a link confirm this ? __label__4 What ' s not working? what do you expect it to do ? __label__4 I figured I would ask you directly, since you objected to my original draft, and it seems to be difficult to workshop specific problems in the general discussion taking place at <url>. How is <url>?__label__4 I ' m no expert on the language, but on the face of it that dab page disambiguates two words which are unambiguous anyway - Zakhmet and Khachpas. Am I missing something ? __label__4 I agreed from my very first post on the first subject that it shouldn ' t be included yet you and the other user continued to misrepresent my position. Would you disagree with that ? __label__4 <sigh> some people have no sense of humor. If I create <url>, do you suppose people will ignore it ? __label__4 Gee, thanks. But shouldn ' t it be a barnstar for ''bad'' humor, or maybe for the humor "phlegm"?__label__4 I don ' t understand your concern with "the user might think that margins contains only :left and :right". How is it different when you use the chart . marings(:left, 10) syntax ?__label__4 There are quite a lot of <url> on Wikipedia. What ' s wrong with adding <url>?__label__4 I thought we had already established consensus last month. What exactly is the deal with the parenthesis and columns ? __label__4 May I ask why you removed <url> from the article on <url>? Since CAP is the USAF ' s official auxiliary, wouldn ' t it make sense for the CAP article to be in the USAF category ? __label__4 Looks like you ' ve been a bit inactive lately, but on the off - chance you check in soon, take a look at <url> and <url>. You ' re probably the most familiar with CoM ' s style and brand of hostility, do you think Freakshownerd here is his sock ? __label__4 What do you mean by "will take an arbitrary number"? Do you think about some input (from user or file) or some other way ? __label__4 Sorry but I never saw any application breaking after deleting / moving .folders.. usualy they just reconfigure and restore to defaults. What exactly did break for you ? __label__4 Also, how do you know it failed? You get an error message ? __label__4 Would it be a better question if it were "Why are Perl threads so $#@$&!*@# slow compared to other languages?"__label__4 Could you provide more details , the summary of that question seems to be that special characters are ignored in google search which applies to this case. Is this the start of an expression ?__label__4 <url>??__label__4 Nope. Do I need to start one ? __label__4 The real question is , what does First returns? Since Dictionnary uses hash values, First is first of what??__label__4 Did you solve the other problem? The multiplication one ? __label__4 Time to register and start giving some votes to the people that are giving you free consulting. All : Is a feature on Stackoverflow that if a user doesn ' t register that there is no calculation of acceptance rate ? __label__4 The only time that I saw that was when using different monitors, or a remote login (in other words : changing the resolution, and then the layout of the panels). Is it your case ?__label__4 experence suggests that most of the time it is an extreamly good criteria but in this case I ' ve put the links back. Which morris side are you with ? __label__4 Do you need the id column? Why not just tell the query to fetch only the name column ? __label__4 Not completely so, because my question is more specific in terms of hash size and ignores performance. Also I am not just looking for _a_ hash function, I am looking for a meaningful choice -- I know there are CRC32 and FNV32, but which is better for my domain ? __label__4 I really had intended ot get back to this, and to get out to see it. How about: ..that <url> was built from plans found in the <url>'s pocket when he died of a heart attack ? __label__4 I obviously made a mistake too. Do you really think I ' d purposefully misinterpret things like that ? __label__4 .. since your ' re quoting something, mind sharing what you ' re quoting? A homework assignment perhaps ? __label__4 Yes, I just saw that. DJ, if you wished to delete the still tagged pages then that was your judgement call but to delete pages which I had already declined a speedy on was rather bad form wouldn ' t you say ? __label__4 Do you still can use build - in rails validation with this custom exception class? Haven ' t you blogged about it ? __label__4 The edit might make the question more relevant to more people. Maybe or maybe not ? __label__4 Hi *@Rikard* - Glad it helped. Can you mark the best answers with the checkmark and vote up any that are good answers ? __label__4 Well, now you ' ve got me puzzled. If you think he ' s a sneaky vandal, why did you revert my reversion of his numerical change ? __label__4 Why isn ' t <url> included there? Is it possible there ' s a redirect in it ' s place ? __label__4 I don ' t understand this answer. What ' s the 2' piece for? Are you assuming the beams are made from a single thickness of 2 - by lumber ? __label__4 - millions of people are using it to get help our service is free of charge. Since it ' s a tech support site you can ' t claim that it ' s not related to the article either (if you disagree with that just google for "consumer electronics tech support" see who comes first).We are here to server the community - why do you find it so offensive ? __label__4 How can people edit them if it just redirects? Did you think about that ? __label__4 how much have you studied yet? Do you want specific questions ? __label__4 Actually, I counted 2 sets of <url>. Can he be blocked for 48 hours ? __label__4 .. but when you do things like <url>, I start distancing myself. What made you come to that decision if you did differently on the <url> and <url>?__label__4 Can you please provide some additional information: Are the lines you quote the only messages relating to granola? Which kernel version are you running ? __label__4 Why don ' t you use the DEBUG flag directly instead of 'delegating' the function to a class variable? It sounds like that telephone game, 'Chinese Whispers' (?)__label__4 At the top of my talk page, it says, "If I left you a message: please answer on your talk page, as I am watching it." I think I already explained this to you. Is there a reason we cannot communicate ? __label__4 Not sure I understand the question: (1) wireshark will look at packets as they come from the wire, so iptables rules for incoming packets do not apply; (2) your iptables rules apply to UDP, but you state that you open a raw socket. Could you please clarify what you are trying to achieve and what does not work as expected ? __label__4 In the article on <url>, you recently replaced a non - free image with J. Malcolm Greany ' s ''Ansel Adams and Camera'' on the basis that the latter image is in the public domain. How did you determine that this image is a work of the U . S. government ? __label__4 You removed the border issue coverage in <url>, and your explanation was that it ' s covered in another article. Where is it covered ? __label__4 The three readings given for that kanji are &#12395;&#12435; (nin), &#12375;&#12398;&#12406; (shinobu), and &#12375;&#12398;&#12403; (shinobi). So what ' s the reading of this word &#19981;&#24525;?__label__4 what have you tried? There are over 200 questions here on SO about random numbers, have you had a look on some of them ? __label__4 Um.. the Kent roast? Tentrake host ? __label__4 Yes. It references the static in A just fine, just not in B. I see why this is a problem since A may have no visibility to B ' s statics. I ' m asking if there is another way to do this ? __label__4 Why bother with the `.php` in the rewritten URLs? Why not just `/course _ view`?__label__4 So who exactly is going to *teach* this topic in the class? Shouldn ' t the teacher be able to "show how it can be implemented"?__label__4 by js?? you mean AJAX??__label__4 Images are always rectangular, how are you creating anything different? Are you looking for [image maps](http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Image _ map)?__label__4 ..cause I feel like a petulant kid, posting it. But: "We have three volunteers: Awadewit, Mike Christie and Wrad." Given that I, you know, proposed the countries idea, wasn ' t it obvious that I was volunteering ? __label__4 The notion that a hunter would kill dozens of birds with a single shot seems outlandish to me. Do you have a reference for this ? __label__4 I ' d assume it ' s a ban on this account, that was used by multiple people. I don ' t think you would be blocked because you at one point edited on this account, and as long as you don ' t use the same IP, I don ' t think you could be blocked, how whould anyone know ? __label__4 What ' s all the .strip() doing in the parsing rules? Shouln ' t your lexer take care of removing trailing whitespace ? __label__4 in this case the noun has to be capitalised, so "Erdene Zuu monastery" would be "Erdene Zuu Monastery". And why did you move <url>, what other monastery with this name exists ? __label__4 Have a look at the edit to <url>. Is this page even a dab ? __label__4 Why not using `isnan()` from math . h? Any specially reason ? __label__4 what can i do about that? Make a new one??__label__4 BTW, small step, huh, from Berkely to Soman ' s talk page. What ' s next--Cambridge ? __label__4 I ' ve never seen something go beyond AN / I myself, and I find it hard to believe the other two hadn ' t been tried by now. Or is it a case - by - case thing ? __label__4 @Marc: Wow. Was it obvious that aali was a sockpuppet account ? __label__4 What do you mean "log in repeadedly? I just keep clickin' what button ? __label__4 Where are you using this code? Have you tried `theme _ get _ setting('logo _ path', 'THEME _ NAME')`, replacing THEME _ NAME with the name of your theme ? __label__4 What is the purpose of knowing if they are using the computer or not? What happens if they are not ? __label__4 give me your personal opinion, is an article with citations and written in a mature manner, about shart, ever going to remain without being deleted? or will i just waste my time if i make it ? __label__4 Do you have 18GiB of memory to store the solution? Do you really need all of them ? __label__4 i really dont understand the question, and also the example is weird. if he throws a ball to 3 others player why there are 5 different paths??__label__4 Yeah, why do you have multiple HTML files in one file in the first place? Wouldn ' t it be easier to remedy that ? __label__4 I don ' t think there ' s any "optimal" way to do it other than just scanning the string looking for the delimiters. Perhaps _you_ could code that yourself ? __label__4 This depends on the version of Drupal. Which version are you using ? __label__4 @Rippo: Tried it and it doesn ' t work. Isn ' t the `$form . find('.person')` supposed to find all elements that have the `person` class inside the form with `personas` id ? __label__4 Title says it all.<url> I dont have time to put up a page.. but might I suggest <url>?__label__4 I hope Ed ' s doesn ' t look like mine. Wait--what is this navbar we ' re talking about ? __label__4 I would go and say, "I can ' t find any problem. Are you sure it ' s not the user?"__label__4 40 kbps is fast enough to load the full facebook . com in about a minute. Is that even worth it ? __label__4 This question is almost word - for - word, the same as http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 3624056/ . Is this homework ? __label__4 I feel I ' m on the receiving end of a cross - cultural dialect issue :) What geographic location is this relevant to ? __label__4 You ' ve already said that you ' re using JPEG200, which will work. What do you have a question about ? __label__4  - 1: For not specifying what is to be done later with the data. If you claim the question is open - ended (interview and all) then why accept an answer ? __label__4 Your bot takes zh : u514bu91ccu65afu6258u5f17xb7u6885u7b56u723eu5fb7 off of the Christoph Metzelder page. What exactly is wrong with it ? __label__4 MONGO, today you speedied this article as a non notable character. Surely you know the non notable speedy criteria is for real people, not characters ? __label__4 No, just admire them from a distance of a couple of centuries! You ? __label__4 Due to your edits to this template, <url> is now required on all transclusions. Are you running a bot to clean this up ? __label__4 I think you need to describe better what you ' re trying to do. You want to break up the string into substrings of a certain length ? __label__4 Whats wrong with `foreach($array as $key => $value)`? Or, asked the other way around, what ' s the point using `foreach($array as $value)` when you actually need `$key` somewhere down the road ? __label__4 What benefits would you have from doing it? I think it is more trouble than it ' s worth.. After all, the names should be read by the users anyway, shouldn ' t they ? __label__4 He ' s doing it again, removing Lauren ' s "bottom 2" placing (<url>). I just reverted him but maybe we need to file something at AN / I ?__label__4 Do you have a Flickr Pro account? Could it be that you ' ve got close to your monthly usage allowance this month ? __label__4 The article already says where they come from in the ''birth location'' field. What ' s the point of repeating it, especially at the expense of other info ? __label__4 Never needed to coat the inside of a frame, WD40 is useful to get any water out. I suppose car wax could work ? __label__4 This has got nothing to do with any of the tags. Please can you retag appropriately if you want an answer ? __label__4 Okay, where can it go then? The list of episodes ? __label__4 Double standards? Biased administrators ? __label__4 That "guest" could have been an undercover Colbert staff member and the whole segment could have been staged. Otherwise, why would Colbert have taken 3 minutes out of his show to talk to someone in the audience ? __label__4 Sorry you ' re trying to make a stream of you on your computer? Screenshots or video from a webcam ? __label__4 One wonders, of course, who "Elliott of Macedon" would have been. Probably something analogous to Brian of Nazareth but in a Macedonian phalanx ? __label__4 I ' m not proficient in Japanese, so correct me if I ' m saying something dumb, but last time I checked, か was a *final* interrogative particle, coming at the very end of a sentence and not changing the intonation of the rest of it, like, *at all*. As to your English examples, would you regard the rewordings "Are you running into.." and "Is (it really (so that)) the fastest way.." as sacrificing the content / format / impact ? __label__4 SuaveArt has edited his post on the Wikipedia Review and is now lying about me. Did you see the actual post there before he changed it so you can back up my cut - n - paste of what it said ? __label__4 @Lev: Your graph model can be seen as the sum of d independently chosen random graphs where each vertex chooses a next neighbour uniformly at random. This would seem to make analysis easier ? __label__4 I ' m not 100% clear on what you ' re asking, but I suspect there ' s one crucial idea that when you get, everything will fall into place. Are you aware that even "empty space" posses a vacuum energy due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and particle - antiparticle pairs can in fact be generated "out of nothing" for very short time periods ? __label__4 Could you please be more specific? What do you mean by "Library Errors"?__label__4 How do you expect a DOM node to be serialized? What information do you want from a DOM node ? __label__4 Finding the min / max of a sequence is at worst a linear operation. How did you come up with something quadratic ? __label__4 I must be missing something here. Would you mind clarifying for me the nature of your extensive work on <url>?__label__4 Your examples have nothing to do with GLn. Are the coefficients always integers ?__label__4 So do I, because, inspite of my 100s of friends and supporters, I ' m feeling a little beleaguered and lonely here. If I can hang on in here, can ' t you at least keep me company ? __label__4 I ' m baffled. What point is there being unblocked only to file an appeal that C has already decided to reject ? __label__4 @Unreason, yes its not an natural thing to grasp, simply put: Possible Haiku combination = Infinite; Number of Monkeys OR Time required to produce said Infinite Hakim = NOT possible, as in order to generate those Infinite Haiku ' s you would need a greater than Infinite amount of time Or GREATER THAN infinite amount of monkeys. Now do you see the contradiction ? __label__4 Can I ask: was this really the implication that you intended in making this change? And do you really think the RfC expressed consensus support for such a position ? __label__4 Just OOC, how often does this happen? Is it really often, or just once every few weeks ? __label__4 I ' m not sure what you ' re asking.. it is final; it is marked as such. Are you wanting to test that its value never changes during the execution of `method`?__label__4 Thanks Bro, it is better to ask is the stead of jumping out and getting a disgruntled Admin on my back. And why would you continualy :: bludgeon yourself over the head with your keyboard when you have my jokes ? __label__4 You seem to have typed a small "x" in the modeline (`1360x1020`), but a capital "X" in `xrandr --addmode`. Is this just a copy / paste error ? __label__4 I would suggest you change the title to something less subjective, such as "What is a good package for displaying algorithms?" or more in line with the current one "What is a good package for displaying dem algorithms?" :)__label__4 My god, the code got all mangled. The insert code capability here is atrocious, just mangles the code and leaves out tags.. How do I fix this ? __label__4 As the log mentions, BTServer is posting a notification called BluetoothAvailabilityChangedNotification. Why don ' t you suscribe to this, and any other notification interesting to your app instead of reading and parsing the logs ? __label__4 I see you have been creating lots of articles on bus stations on the <url>. Considering how little information there is (and is likely to be) for these stations, would it not be better to have them all on one article ? __label__4 The same goes for our lives. Arent we effected directly by decisions made in the White House ? __label__4 What do you mean by "There ' s no Interlocked function available that will actually swap values."? Why can ' t you use these functions ? __label__4 Again: What attributes do you have? What is the structure of your data ? __label__4  " Cactus League", eh? Let ' s see.. what does Liebman have in common with the type of pain you might get from a cactus needle ? __label__4 Could you clarify what you think the problem with `Digest::MD5` might be? If you can ' t, why don ' t you just use it ? __label__4 Can you clarify please? What you want to do is change `some . email@gmail . com` to `this . other . email@gmail . com`, without changing any other information and retaining your accumulated messages ? __label__4 Just try the first instruction - `MOVE *R2, R1` - read the comment next to it - it pretty much tells you all you need to know. What do you think the result of this instruction will be ?__label__4 What ' s your issue with noting the copyright registration date for this piece? Also, could you point me to the consensus you mentioned ? __label__4 Now I ' m confused--did I miss something? Who was talking about G1, and who was talking about IP blocks ? __label__4 re: <url> edit. Then let me ask you, what exactly was offensive about them ? __label__4 And what about <person>? Does it need fixed now too ? __label__4 I pretty much agree with <url>, except I would like to know why you modified the see also section to be a hatnote. Doesn ' t <url> have specific requirements for this ? __label__4 I ' m unclear on what you ' re asking; is the registry entry _not_ deleting (or returning after you ' ve deleted it). Or is the debugger prompt still appearing despite having deleted the registry setting ? __label__4 I am concern why this user never replies to messages left on her talk page. Does she talk ? __label__4 How is it awkward? Which version of VS (they have different levels of js intellisense support)?__label__4 @NV, if it ' s a job interview, are you allowed to get outside help? I mean, you ' re the one who ' s applying for the job, right ? __label__4 Ultimately, **every** file is represented using `0` and `1` only. What makes a "bitmap index" different ? __label__4 Ack, hit the wrong button? How do you manage that ? __label__4 Why does transparency matter? It ' s just another channel, just like red, green or blue ? __label__4 Why can ' t your second snippet just `return result`? Or at least, if Yes or No or Cancel, `return result`?__label__4 How come you removed Dobby as an omitted character? Where does he appear ? __label__4 @Qmal: why don ' t you want it? Any reason ? __label__4 The "shaped bokeh" effect is a special case. Does http://photo . stackexchange . com / questions / 2706 / what - is - bokeh - really answer your question ? __label__4 Maybe you can add the way you (or your (grand ) mother) prepare it ? __label__4 To be perfectly honest, I really have no idea what you ' re talking about. Would it not be simpler to just ''add'' a link to the template (if that is indeed what you mean) than to create a potentially offensive and almost certain to be rapidly deleted category ? __label__4 @Matt No it ' s not, because hashes are not encryption. Better would be "Can I find the preimage for a hash?"__label__4 The instructions you linked mention using Visual C++ Express, yet your output tells that distutils tries to use gcc. What are you actually using ? __label__4 well it wasn ' t exactly a joke. am I the only one who notice they share the same melody ? __label__4 @Eric no, this is hobby stuff. Why, does it make a difference ? __label__4 Not enough details. What programming problem do you have ? __label__4 How many other states follow the same pattern? And do we really need it to ? __label__4 Alright, I don ' t like it but is not worth wasting more time on, but (as you now noticed as well) if it ''really'' had been deleted for <url>, it would have been truly problematic. Can I just ask: ''if'' Mephistophelian would return, are we allowed to undelete it ? __label__4 Not my question, but okay. Would you care to elaborate on this and tell me what exactly is wrong ? __label__4 If the zeros are not valid data, why are they in the vector to begin with? If they are valid, why would you not want to StdDev to account for them ? __label__4 Since I have not been able to get an answer to this on the project page, let me ask you directly: Did you receive Durova ' s "secret evidence" prior to the blocking of <url>?__label__4 OK, so while browsing my watchlist, I saw something peculiar in one of the pages that I ' m watching; the user seems to be quite suspicious, based on his user page (similar to Wynchard Bloom ' s) which leads to the conclusion that he ' s Gerald. Can you like give him the stick ? __label__4 @shakti : that ' s not an issue . My question is why there is no output ?__label__4 FYI, perhaps you failed to notice, but Anthropologist ' s "accursed" faux pas was already brought to his attention by Philbrick. I think you ' ll probably agree that a second, dedicated TP section is a bit of an overkill, no ? __label__4 Was the stuck batter really brown? Did it stick on the sides ? __label__4 Unless im making a major mistake here, this article was about a Not for profit organisation which seemed notable enough to give the origional creator at least some time to source it. Are you sure this had to be a speedy ? __label__4 I ' m loathe to come running to an admin, but Gregcaletta is just making the same edits that I had undone before and made objection to on the talk page without any attempt to address the previous objections on the talk page. Now what ? __label__4 Dude, what ' s going on? Why are you leaving ? __label__4 That user <url> moved <url> page for no reason and I do not understand why it was moved or why a persistent vandalist like this was allowed to move it. Is there anyway at all to get it moved back and that user permanently banned ? __label__4 Why would you copy an egg? Did not introduced yourself to `virtualenv` yet ? __label__4 You ' re not "removing" duplicates -- you ' re merging them. Right ? __label__4 Im not really sure what you are up to. Chances are that you would like to do something as asked in [this question](http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 4924350)?__label__4 Why did you rollback <url>? It appears by a quick scan that the user was correct re <url> - but regardless seemed a good faith edit, one certainly not worthy of a vandalism rollback I would think ? __label__4 Accepted! @Rory, one more thing - can you add a line about using the *right* hashing algorithms ? __label__4 I think I misunderstood. Is the peak perpendicular to the garage door, or parallel ? __label__4 Are they a particular type of files? Do all users have access to all the files and do they require it ? __label__4 What is a wall these days? 10 sentences ? __label__4 I don ' t know why claim that you reverted vandalism (rv edit summary) when to me they appeared to be good faith edits. What exactly was the vandalism ? __label__4  " Checkpoints", hmm? Must they be visited in order ? __label__4 I can, but it is written in Lithuanian language, so I think you woun ' t understand. Anyway, where should I put it ? __label__4 I have to say, I ' ve reviewed the suggestions that "year in x" not be piped, and I vehemently disagree. As I note on the [[Wikipedia talk : Piped link|talk page]], "[s ] ee [[Lindsay Lohan]] for a good example of why piping is a good thing (a simple [&#91 ; 2003 in film]] in line would create clunky, hard - to - follow writing & mdash ; better to use no links at all)." Comment ? __label__4 Sorry, I don ' t really understand what you want it to do. Why would you hold it to your ear while dialing, and what does that have to do with vibrating on answering a call ? __label__4 What are you trying to get exactly? If the list is just 2 tickets with priorities 3 and 5, what do you want to find ? __label__4 By downvoting without any comment is not helping anyone. Don ' t you think that some kind of explanation would be nice for Ved ? __label__4 How does your grammar look like? It is a full - blown language, or just some math equation ? __label__4 Something ' s still not right with me here. Think you can perform one of those cleanups ? __label__4 So how are u gonna concider weither the licences used by Fluckr are accurate..? ,and if this image has to bee conciderd than http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Image : Petercrouch _ liverpool . JPG should be to..?__label__4 I note you reverted my edit on <url>, quoting "consensus". What consensus ? __label__4 @omri yes you are right.. I have applied the logic acc. to what I thought is right if somebody could tell me what ' s wrong I have done ??__label__4 @carleeto: Have you tried the various suggestions in the answers? 15 minutes? Wow . __label__4 Hyphenation in English is a pain (and worth a PhD thesis or two) but I remember learning the Castillian hyphenation rules in school as a child, so it would seem to be much simpler (unless I ' m missing something, of course). Is hyphenation in Asturian all that different from Castillian ? __label__4 |style="vertical - align: top; border - top: 1px solid gray;" | For creating an article on a relatively obscure bridge with interesting information that remains in the current article, which has become the focus of the world for all the wrong reasons, I hereby award you this oddball barnstar. Who knew all this could happen ? __label__4 Strange, because it should use the Intel chipset drivers to run the USB. Have you updated to the latest Boot Camp ? __label__4 @Yoga, did you get around to reading the FAQ ? And why is advice for a better question bullying ? __label__4 I ' d like to ask why you ' re so insistent on creating a page called <url>, which means the same thing as <url>. Are you disagreeing that they mean the same thing, do you feel that the <url> article is bad, or do you feel that <url> is a better name for the article ? __label__4 Is there an explicit reason you can not simulate data yourself (i . e. why you can not make your own gold standard and see how changing reference systems impacts this)?__label__4 @hakre: I don ' t understand how I can circumvent the "that" by using physical media in distribution. Can you explain please ? __label__4 Why is this closed? The asker is looking for organised week - long rides. He could expand his question a bit, give more details of the type of ride he is looking for, but otherwise, why ? __label__4 I think you ' ve got a typo here, I doubt that command returned "How do I find out which process is eating up my bandwidth?".. ;) any chance you could edit the question please ? __label__4 Are you 100% sure that the planks in your hardware store never got treated with chemicals ? __label__4 Sorry, I still don ' t get it? You want the nodes to be edited / deleted by the same role as node author ? __label__4 Having said that, I don ' t want to drive anyone away just because they can ' t write well. The question is, where do you begin ? __label__4 @eWolf: Sorry, I didn ' t have a chance to install the XNA framework. Have you considered listing your application on [StackList](http://stacklist . quickmediasolutions . com/)?__label__4  / me scratches head. did you let VP access the internet through your firewall ? __label__4 @codeka - 4 in all of those bases is still 4. A more interesting question would be, what base is "10"? :P__label__4 Thank you very much @Lubos Motl ! Would you please sum up your comments and post them as an answer ? __label__4 No, I didn ' t know that. Where does this "rule" come from ? __label__4 Why do you need builtin DB support? Do you want to call the graph functions with SQL code as argument ? __label__4 pass from where? what ' s your desired use - case ? __label__4 He published the document himself for the world to see. What privacy ? __label__4 sound weird to me, why do you need to unmount? what ' s wrong with just shutdown ? __label__4 Regarding <url>: <url> seems to say the exact opposite (that links on a dab page should ''not'' be through redirects). The page is at <url>, so shouldn ' t that be how it ' s linked on the dab page ? __label__4 The only way I have a naval website is that I am one of the people actively working to make sure Wikipedia has good coverage of naval topics here. Which website do you think I run ? __label__4 Iulius! Could you provide exact reference of article u017dirmu016bnai part ''Demographics'' ethnicity composition ? __label__4 What exactly want you to install the mysql server? Can you give the commands you entered + the output ? __label__4 I ' m don ' t understand what you are getting at here. It might help if you told us what `$one`, `$top _ level` and the output you want are, along with that "the value" means the value of what ? __label__4 Hi Debresser, what ' s up? Why are you doing what you are doing ? __label__4 This post says some things about "ownership" and "GIS" and "land" but there ' s no recognizable, unambiguous question. Could you please clarify and repost ? __label__4 I ' m not sure what you mean by pointing out that votes were placed before the version you created. Could you elaborate ? __label__4 I asked it before but I ' m asking it again: Was it a Basque state? Can we say that ? __label__4 What is exactly your problem? What does not work ? __label__4 OK, fair enough. But it ' s still not a SO question ? __label__4 Since your last warning to BigBang19, he ' s continued to vandalize the ''Punk ' d'' article, undoing the grammatical corrections I made some time ago, and inserting irrelevant, non - noteworthy material about Kuthcer ' s observence of Jewish holidays and his marriage to Demi Moore. Can someone block this person for a period of more than just 24 hours so that he gets the message ? __label__4 There ' s nothing in your history besides editing my page, so I ' m not sure to what you are referring. What page are you talking about ? __label__4 You also did three reversions. Where are the administrators, meanwhile ? __label__4 I read his note, and you should know that as I responded to it and then you responded to me. So where did the doubt come in regarding that matter ? __label__4 @Joonas: What about the solution posted by Benjamin Manns? That does not work for you ? __label__4 <url>. Or is it just me ? __label__4 What "did not work"? closing of the connection or removing the persistence ? __label__4 Gah! What just happned ? __label__4 So how come he can have all types of slandereous links on his wiki page? Don ' t you think being an admin you should delete them ? __label__4 You seem to have missed the whole point of templates, there. Why create the text manually using concatentation and then "rendering" something that contains no template syntax, rather than actually using a template file with proper template logic that can do all that for you ? __label__4 Storing an entire HTML page as CSV doesn ' t really make much sense. You mean convert an HTML table to CSV ? __label__4 This looks unnecessarily complicated. What are `prodsofar` and `listsofar` supposed to represent ? __label__4 Thank you! I am confused about the save function though.. can you please explain how is works ? __label__4 Is there any point to the quotation that ' s not served equally by the link on its own? Other than the obvious (which I ' d like to think you ' re above), which is trolling the student pollies ? __label__4 Also, could you please explain the second scenario a little ? how is that possible ?__label__4 @Marc: Could you, please, make more precise your statement "two paths are different iff they use different child nodes in a branching node". You mean they ' re different if there is such a branching node where they use different child nodes ? __label__4 What is / are "all monthy in whay"? Are you trying to state that you need to list all values in January along with their sum ? __label__4 I ' d be surprised if the network is slowing you down that much..try those commands in the python window in ArcMap. Are they still slow ? __label__4 What dictionary do you normally use? Does it lack these definitions or are they confusing ? __label__4 What do you mean by "moving"? Moving around in your window or a moving image like a *.gif ? __label__4 I think you may have made a typo in your question, you show Data #3 at index 4, then later show Data [ 4] = Data #4. But essentially you want to have an list with all 9 values, and fill in nulls where a value is not provided ? __label__4 Nope, no sense. What ' s a conceptual break in this context ? __label__4 I ' ve never worked with beamer `\note`. Could you please add a minimal example for your problem which compiles ? __label__4 Are you both "Dribblingscribe" and "Indiestu" ? Do both those accounts belong to the same person ? __label__4 Please clarify your definition of bacon. Perhaps with a picture ? __label__4 Can you explain what you mean by 'marking up reusable elements' a nd 'standardized markup'? Do you mean reusing code (i . e. snippets of logic / functionality) or reusing UI elements ? __label__4 Your early edit ' s clearly indicate that you were not a newbie. How do explain this ? __label__4 I think we must sort the group for select algorithm but it is not necessary for sorting the elements in the quick select algorithm !! isn ' t it ? __label__4 the last one doesn ' t work if i ' m working on battery power Is their a solution for this ? __label__4 Why are you holding this as a string? Can ' t you convert them to a dictionary ? __label__4 What about B . C, B . D, and C . D? Why does your goal not include these ? __label__4 Where does it say in the policy that it doesn ' t apply to good users? Where in the policy does it say only soft blocks should be performed ? __label__4 it seems you are posting some parameter named `imagename` from your code, and you are trying to find path of that parameter ?? confusing, Or if you are uploading the file and you want the path to file from client??__label__4 I see that KarBot is editing User Talk Pages. Is this deliberate ? __label__4 That said, why remove any mention of the way the incomplete? This seems especially relevant because the American production ended in the same way, with no word from the editor stating that the perfect edition ending would be released ? __label__4  " The" house arrest? Shouldn ' t it either be "her" house arrest or just simply "house arrest"?__label__4 Either <url> is really misinterpreting the guidelines or I missed out on something. Care to shed light here ? __label__4 OTRS. At this point why not try ? __label__4 Please define "primary navigation". Also: are you using a custom theme, or one from the theme repository ? __label__4 You ' ve violated <url> on <url>, with 2 reverts in half an hour. Would you like to revert yourself to avoid being blocked again ? __label__4 Err, okay. But let ' s make sure our answers are accurate by using <url> rather than something we heard someone say, eh ? __label__4 Okay, but everything has to do with physics. Is there a survival . SE? :)__label__4 I ' m confused: what did you do? And how did you delete it twice without restoring it in between ? __label__4 It was for closure ' s sake, as to show that the debate was closed and that was the result, the user was ''blocked'' and the userpage was ''deleted''. Doesn ' t that show you the items better ? __label__4 How do you know the i386 machine is i386 only? Also, why not a universal build ? __label__4 Well, you look in Data::Compare and see what they do. Why don ' t you want to use that module ? __label__4 You ' re acting very oddly today: You ' ve just reverted two separate edits on <url>, saying they were the phrasing of the Lancet, but neither references the Lancet, and it seems unlikely that both would have the same statement applying to them. Have you been hacked ? __label__4 I ' m slightly surpirised that this post just got to 1k views and still there ' s no voting on the answers. Is that just laziness, are viewers lacking voting rights or is there something wrong with the answer ( s)?__label__4 So your argument is that as long as you follow the "rules," nothing else should matter? That if it ' s legal it ' s OK ? __label__4 Your title mentions relativity, but your question body does not. Could you resolve this for us please ? __label__4 The bug you refer to is detected in 1 . 6 . 0 _ 4 and not yet fixed. Why wouldn ' t you expect it to be present in your environment ? __label__4 This does not look like Python.. what exactly do you want? parse C++ code with a Python program ? __label__4 Please, show a minimal example. Are you using the setspace package or other tools that enlarge the interline space ? __label__4 what doesn ' t work about it? can you provide some example js in your post to demonstrate it not working ? __label__4 .. not possible to my knowledge. Any reason you want something like that ? __label__4 Some clarification questions: 1) Do you want BibTeX to get the information _directly_ from the database, or are you prepared to extract it yourself in .bib format? 2) Do you already have the information in a database in a specific format and want to use only that, or would you be happy converting to another bibliographic database system ? __label__4 The consequences apparently have no sliding scale? It ' s either "you ' re blocked," or you ' re not ? __label__4 p . s. why would having more molasses make it hygroscopic, I thought that meant water - seeking. Wouldn ' t the drier ingredient absorb more water ? __label__4 Please explain this <url>. Is there a valid reason why this image was removed ? __label__4 @Pax: would you really call this a _basic_ question? Considering it depends on the alignment of the instruction bytes ? __label__4 Yikes. Don ' t stoves usually provide heat that ' s too uneven and would tend to stress and break glass ? __label__4 In your nom of Everyking you wrote ''..as Everyking is a former administrator, he made over 1 , 300 in his 2+ year time as a sysop.'' Should that be over 1 , 300 sysop actions ? __label__4 Hello Glacier109, I am contacting you because in golf they put Money not Winnings as the standard on most leaderboards used at the end of tournaments. I am just wondering why you selected the word winnings ? __label__4 Is this homework? What have you tried so far ? __label__4 I understand the problem with that redundant category--I ' ve hashed that out, I think--but why did you remove ALL categories from the Christian shows? That seems..excessive.. Or do I just need a nap ? __label__4 If you wrote the CGI script, then you know how that script determines where to put the files and how to name them. What is stopping you from adding that information to a database ? __label__4 What ' s with all the crap behind him? Was this at a signature desk ? __label__4 it **only** affects the object that has been created in the last loop - round? or, it **also** affects the object that has been created in the last loop - round ? __label__4 Outside or inside? Is there are paint or enamel or anything on the wood already ? __label__4 Andy, that jars with my understanding of what a Sylvester matrix is. Do you have a reference ? __label__4 Why did you edit out my 'Hi', and 'Thanks'? Is common courtesy not allowed any more ? __label__4  ( S ) he seems to have violated the spirit of 3RR <url>. How do we deal with this guy ? __label__4 You might want to explain a bit more of the *removing* business. Why is the first `remove` removing `2` (tail of the sequence), but the second removing `3` (which at the time is the head of the sequence)?__label__4 You mean "the higher solubility in the ocean"? Solubility of what ? __label__4 How are you grilling them? High heat? Low and Slow? How long does it take to cook them on the grill ? __label__4 I ' m sorry, but I can ' t understand `find the missing element in O ( N) or better` What does mean *"or better"* in this context? It seems the kind of thing that would be solved with a simple while loop, but anyway I don ' t understand - it ' s either *solved* or *not solved*, right ? __label__4 Perhaps these articles should be nominated for deletion. A blue belt is far from a notable BJJ player; Google returns 594 results for him, many of which might not even be the Barry Ley in question; and as for the Blaggers article: I don ' t see any articles on the higher - selling books you mention, why does this one deserve it ? __label__4 Career advice questions like this one are too localized for this site. Please see [Are Career Advice questions useful for anyone except the poster](http://meta . programmers . stackexchange . com / questions / 588 / are - career - advice - questions - useful - to - anyone - except - the - poster / 590 # 590)?__label__4 Why would your application need such a structure? What are you doing ? __label__4 Have you tried upgrading using the tools provided with core? What errors have you encountered ? __label__5 As a side note, I ' m slightly amused that on the one hand, you caution me not to "encourage" the penguieater troll, explicitly striking out the "mocking" part, but then in the same breath you sign the finding that cites those same penguin diffs as evidence of terrible insults and intimidation. Slightly inconsistent, perhaps ? __label__5 Apparently, you correctly answered your own question: The watch window gets the value of a variable by calling its `ToString` method. So, what ' s your *actual* question ? __label__5 Why did everyone list universities? Aren ' t there any other types of infosec policies ? __label__5 @Andrew I beg to differ, the examples aren ' t good enough to explain what he wants. It ' s like saying "I need *something*, for instance a car, so can you help?".__label__5 Cla, your partisanship is indeed fairly obvious, and pointing to one article where you ' ve deliberately been good isn ' t good enough. So: if I point you to my stand against AJL, will you declare me to be non - partisan ? __label__5 cuz then it wouldn ' t be a BINARY search. Any more obvious questions I can answer for ya? :)__label__5 Sorry @klox I don ' t understand. Could you explain a bit more ? __label__5 *"I am going to be developing a real - time web application"* - good luck with that! How are you planning to get around the internet latency ? __label__5 REVERT??__label__5 iPhone 3 . 3? Do you work for Apple or something ? __label__5  ' copy public link' doesn ' t show on my dropbox. what happen ? __label__5 ''I just take care of the problem.'' Can ' t you work ''with'' me, and not ''against'' me ? __label__5 When we have a GLAM barnstar then you get it .. just for the Hindi article! I cannot explain why you needed to create a Derby page in Hindi - surely it should be there already ? __label__5 What ' s going on? Why did you revert my edits to those articles without any explanation ? __label__5 Hardcore the password? Would that make it a password to an adult site ? __label__5 Why did you revert my edits on that page? You say it was unsourced but it was sourced, I put two references to two fair sources (not blogs nor politicaly bound), so why did you remove them ? __label__5 Why not? How many colors do you want ? __label__5 I certainly think more things should be deleted from enwiki, but TheCommunity ( tm) is fickle. Are you complaining about something ''I'' did ? __label__5 What platforms are you talking about? Does it have to work across platforms ? __label__5 What, you are saying that nothing published at mises . org is a reliable source? What is your basis for asserting that ? __label__5 Your poorly written, bizarre comment makes no sense, since all of my edits in the Al Franken article conform to wikipedia ' s NPOV policy. What are you talking about ? __label__5 Agian, wishful thinking is one thing, fantasyland, now back to reality, Can you provide me ONE journal, ONE book that mentioned the term "palestinians" before 1960 ' s?? Why not ? __label__5 @Brian useful != possible. The question was, what is possible ? __label__5 **deletes even so cynical comment**. Can you tell a bit more about the nature of your data and how you want to display it ? __label__5 I am curious why this is an interesting question. Why would you care, as long as it ' s not leaky ? __label__5 To whom are you referring, Hipicrite? Who has a "secret opinion"?__label__5 Herlihy & Shavit ' s book, The Art of Multiprocessor Programming, or ["Lock - free linked lists and skip lists"](http://ww . cse . yorku . ca/~ruppert / Mikhail . pdf) or [java . util . concurrent](http://download . oracle . com / javase / 6 / docs / api / java / util / concurrent / ConcurrentSkipListMap . html) or [Practical lock - freedom](http://ww . cl . cam . ac . uk / research / srg / netos / lock - free/). Have you considered using a concurrent hash table like a [hopscotch hash table](https://sites . google . com / site / cconcurrencypackage / hopscotch - hashing)?__label__5 O RLY? And what does it do there ? __label__5 Self - follow - up: Also, while sometimes the status quo should be maintained, by supporting it in this case, you ' re also supporting a "revert - first, ask questions later" approach to dealing with good faith edits. Is that really what you want ? __label__5 This is an awesome question. I think the question should be, "How do I import the [Geonames list for India (ID . zip)](http://download . geonames . org / export / dump/) as taxonomy terms so it works with Hierarchical Select?"__label__5 If its your homework you should possibly do it yourself. Have you even tried it ? __label__5 How about some code? Otherwise, how can we tell what you ' re doing with the image?!__label__5 How is it false to state he was the ruler of the PRC - terms such as "Mao ' s government" are used in the article. Can you leave your Marxist personal beliefs at the door ? __label__5 As it is currently worded, this question is pretty broad. Could you provide more specific information about what kind of portrait shots you are hoping to take ? __label__5 You ' re a troll. Why not go somewhere else ? __label__5 You tags are misleading - Algorithm, data structures and in your question you are asking for an answer to the puzzle. what do you want ? __label__5 what is your problem? what is your question ? __label__5 Why did you remove my comment from your page? What was the reason for that ? __label__5 ''<url>''Please also answer the questions at paragraph ''<url>'' above, as you are looking like a classic bully admin who abuses his powers and should be stripped of that role. Is there any review process in wikipedia, for proposing that you be stripped of your admin powers for bullyism ? __label__5 Oh that ' s charming, so instead of making a personal attack on a single editor you made it on a class of editors. Does that somehow make it more ok ? __label__5 Do you mean multiple categories of blogs? Or multiple discrete blogs like CNN ' s blog site ? __label__5 What benefit will you gain if we do your homework for you? Why don ' t you do it yourself ? __label__5 Emulating how a fish "thinks" is the way to get it really right, worse you can ' t even start on a rough heuristic until you know what a "fish - like swimming path" *looks* like. Do you even have a way to judge how you ' re doing ? __label__5 That ' s what groups are for. http://docs . djangoproject . com / en / 1 . 3 / topics / auth/#groups Why aren ' t you using groups ? __label__5 I use the [full - size version](http://training . perl . com / scripts / rename) of the rename script everyday. Why in the world would you *not* want to use existing code ? __label__5 Did you build the wheels for your car on your own, or you bought the ready ones from the store? If you didn ' t reinvent the wheels literally, why are you considering it metaphorically ? __label__5 You ' ve completely lost me. What are you asking about ? __label__5 One final thing: "If anything, many vegetarians are characterized by their disapproval of non - violence (towards animals)." You do realise that you are saying, here, that many vegetarians approve of violence towards animals? Is that really what you meant ? __label__5 Um - no. And I take it you delieve all racist and fascist groups are "right wing"?__label__5 could you give an example, please. What oportunity do you mean ? __label__5 Sorry. But, what is "Sym" button ? __label__5 What did they give as the reason they rejected your site? And what did you do to resolve that problem ? __label__5  " Using an SSD as an SD Card" does not make sense to me. Can you please explain ? __label__5 @Paul: The list of operands you can use inside a predicate does not include "and", but you ' re using the comma as if it were an "and". Should we consider "and" to be allowable in the definition of a predicate ? __label__5 Bread has *plenty* of water. Do you mean bread *crumbs*, which are typically used in batters ? __label__5 Um, you know that the last couple of replies have been from someone other than Esprqii? Right ? __label__5 You could specify whether you need an introduction on applied statistics, or one on (theoretical) statistical inference. I . e., do you want the framework of testing, regression and ANOVA explained or do you want to know what the central limit theorem and the inequality of Chebiyshev have to do with the weak law of large numbers ? __label__5 When you say that the Sharpe ratio is the mean divided by the sample standard deviation.. "Up to a constant factor (sqrt ( n), where n is the number of observations)".. what does this last part mean? Is it really the mean divided by the standard error of the mean ? __label__5 Excuse me? What are you accusing me of doing ? __label__5 Which of course is all the more ironic as my initial edits were an attempt to ''improve'' the article per <url>. Who the hell would have predicted all this ? __label__5 karthick, that was a great answer. Could you please add some info on OCRFeeder to mark it as the accepted answer ? __label__5 I don ' t see anything strange in the log you posted. What do you expect `NSTokenField` to do??__label__5 @Mitch: I have given you my answer. Can you give your ' s now ? __label__5 So you deny you did anything wrong Jason? And we ' re all Nazi ' s persecuting you, Itake and Uncle Davey ? __label__5 *"Use a JavaScript literal."* Huh ? __label__5 Please provide more detail of what you have "Kabob" (kebab) is not a technical term, and means many different things depending where you live. Are the Kebabs raw or cooked? Why do you think it will not be tender ? __label__5 It ' s not my job to add the "Bronze Age" material in the article on <url>, so please refrain from removing existing material just because you haven ' t made any effort to add the "Bronze Age" content. OK ?__label__5 Do you mean something like "Intrateam 30 - minute meeting"? Or does it have to be one word ? __label__5 So this *is* a trick question, right? Or am I just completely useless ? __label__5 What do you mean they are not related to the scope of <url>? Like which articles ? __label__5 Why are you putting <nowiki><person></nowiki> on several pages related with Yu - musicians? IMO this is a pretty <strike>stup</strike> meaningless stub to have; why not <nowiki><person></nowiki> instead ? __label__5 Why not just leave it in the fridge? Do you really need easy quick access to the butter ? __label__5 I ' ve never been able to get Mail . app to use the Exchange account that Google provides for mobile device use. Any chance they ' re using Google ? __label__5 someone? anyone ? __label__5 show some code ? what u mean not work ?__label__5 I asked you a question. Be educated and please respond: What does <url> has to do with <url>?__label__5 homework? perchance ? __label__5 Was this wholesale revert really necessary? <url> Did the edit completely fail to improve the article in any way ? __label__5 How do you know the author / uploader of <url> intended it to be licenced under the copyright licence that you attached to the file with <url> Are you clairvoyant or did the uploader tell you this was his wish ? __label__5 No, I have not read it, as it is of no interest to me or this encyclopedia. Are you claiming that the references make the blog post a reliable source, or why are we still discussing this ? __label__5 Please explain why you continue to <url> <url> <url> over the folk magic / Christian revivalist wording in the lede despite the clear consensus against you. You have not gained any favorable comments for your position in the RFC (which in fact is about the treasure seeking sentence you want to add and not about rewording or removing the existing sentence), so on what basis do you claim preeminence for your preferred wording, or for removing the sentences completely ? __label__5 Are you using cheesecloth, and worried because the finer particles get through and settle out? Or are you just running it through a sieve and seeing small cracklings still floating in it..?__label__5 How would there be a conflict? You ' re not using user supplied filenames for anything, are you ? __label__5 Can you post a link to which themes you ' ve downloaded. Also, are you using the stock launcher or some other customised one like ADW or Launcher Pro ? __label__5 Evidently, I don ' t have enough consciousness, because I haven ' t the foggiest idea of what you ' re talking about. Could you tell me ? __label__5 Why do you have a problem with the inclusion of Lady Bristol ' s persona prior to her 2nd marriage? And to the inclusion of Somerset ' s son - in - law ? __label__5 I started, but gave up. And why link the word 'mother'?__label__5 Also are you complete sold with VSFTPD? Or would you be interested in other types of FTP softwares like pureftp ? __label__5 Are you kidding me? Do you even bother to click on <url> to see its fleet ? __label__5 What exactly do you want to interpolate? What is the resolution and distribution of your measurement points ? __label__5 Could you kindly stick to the issue at hand in the FAC? Which is to discuss the article, not me ? __label__5 Huh? Is that a web address or a wikilink ? __label__5 Why not use a database such as MySQL? And more disturbing is why didn ' t anyone mention that ?!?!__label__5 my iphone 4 ( only one week old, with iOS 4 . 3 installed 5 days ago), HAD custom labels but now doesnt. Did it go away between 4 . 2 and 4 . 3 ??__label__5 Why did you make this community wiki? Why are you refusing to read the documentation ? __label__5 CW, you are aware that Lebanon isn ' t Hezbollah, right? In the same way that Ireland isn ' t the IRA ? __label__5 I didn ' t know that you had to use an email address instead of a username. When did that change ? __label__5 Sergio, can you please clarify? Do you mean "a wave or a particle"?__label__5 1st of all, I think `string` is a reserved word, and shouldn ' t be used. Second of all, have you tried debugging with console . log ? __label__5 Also, when you look at the logs, are the calls to the server become less frequent? Is it possible you have a loop or call that gets slower over time ? __label__5 Any more of this hoax crap at <url>, <url>, Eyre / Heller garbage, and you will be ''permanently'' banned from editing. Is that clear ? __label__5 <url> and <url> seem to be two articles on the same subject. What ' s the point of having separate articles ? __label__5 What are they? Where did that offensive photo come from ? __label__5 I fail to see how you call copyleft "selfish", but are fine with the idea of totally proprietary licenses. Wouldn ' t those be even more selfish, then ? __label__5 And this is your first edit. Isn ' t that interesting ? __label__5 Wait, that wasn ' t the question, was it. What appears after these that I don ' t have ? __label__5 Maybe it would be better if we never talked directly to each other ever again. Agreed ? __label__5 I asked "A or B?", and you said "Yes"..?__label__5 Anyway why put up with all this carelessness? Why are sockpuppets and trolls being enabled ? __label__5 BTW, nobody else has been keeping that page updated as much as I have worked on it for the entire hockey year, and it would be dead and empty without my work. So, why don ' t you be positive and praise my work instead of being so picky on such a minor, insignificant thing as putting 'vacant' on - top instead of below a player who no longer is on the team ? __label__5 What?! Why did you resolve this without dealing with the User I mentioned ? __label__5 Bingo! Since you ' ve seen the light, now will you stop trying to craft PR statements ? __label__5  " non - default screen resolutions when using virtual display over screen sharing" — a statement, not a question. Please: do you *prefer*, or wish to *avoid* the non - default resolutions ? __label__5 I suggest re - titling the question, as this has nothing to do with ebay. Perhaps a title like "How can I secure my PHP website?".__label__5 The file clearly states this is an image from a poster. Since when does this require any additional explanation ? __label__5 I ' m not sure I would say either of those phrases as it ' s unclear to me what they would mean, exactly. Could you give a bit more context ? __label__5 The output you give doesn ' t tie in at all clearly with the inputs in the second case. What are you really after ? __label__5 @Rajendra: I have read it carefully, and both the original problem and the converted problem can be interpreted in multiple ways. Is it that hard to give a yes or no answer ? __label__5 Third: it ' s August 31 2010. Please check my userpage for reasons why I really don ' t feel useful today. Ask another admin, okay ? __label__5 So you exchanged my suggestion with an ''expired'' nomination.. Right ? __label__5 Thank you for this code . But when I put it in my file the title "Table of content" doesn ' t change. Could you help me, please ? __label__5 If you have something to say for keeping that picture, say it here and I ' ll copy it over to the FFD page. But, frankly, if you can ' t even be bothered to check out the <url> rules to find out about why the Zguri image isn ' t acceptable, how do you expect to be able to make any relevant argument about the other one ? __label__5 I ' m not even sure who this person is! Which page is this about ? __label__5 Your comment about "the additions were left intact as a courtesy" sounds a bit strange to me. Maybe you should read <url>?__label__5 @BioBuckyBall: Do you read what I wrote? Do you read every word ? __label__5 You can do just about anything with one pin of a micro. More specific please ? __label__5 Which views version are you using? Are you using the views - 7 . x - 3 . x - dev with the new UI ? __label__5 You also seem to have 'Web' there twice. Which browser are you using, and do you have any greasemonkey scripts or plugins which may be breaking the links ? __label__5 I ' m assuming that you want to delete the email messages on the non - Gmail account. Which email provider are you using ? __label__5 you have been following me around all week reverting my edits. what did i do to you ? __label__5 If I had asked you, the same thing that I did would have been accomplished. Why force you to go through the trouble of removing them if someone else is already removing all the others ? __label__5 You make it very hard to believe that you ' re acting in good faith when you rewrite the <url> article to remove all references to "liberal," but keep the phrase "conservative Independence Institute." I see POV - pushing when that happens. If you ' re so concerned about adjectives, why not edit the articles about AEI or Heritage or Americans for Tax Reform ? __label__5 OK, then, define "bias", propose a way to quantify it, and if it ' s accepted by consensus, we ' ll apply it to ''all'' the admins on that page. Or, perhaps as a starting point, how about presenting some evidence ? __label__5 Aren ' t answers from Kev and papin totally opposite? So what ' s the truth ? __label__5 wait.. what? Since there ' s only one actual neutral connection coming into the box, that one has to somehow connect to all five lamps, doesn ' t it ? __label__5 You do not appear to have alerted the other previous Delete advocates yet. May we take this as a tacit admission that actually you ''were'' intending to skew the deletion review ? __label__5 I based my sentence on the citation. Are you saying the citation is wrong ? __label__5 Can you add a reference to the LP bug, i . e. link it from your question ? __label__5 The question should not be "are assertions good?", but rather, "when are assertions good?"__label__5 If you ' re going to accuse me of operating in bad faith, then the discussion has become inappropriately personal. On what grounds do you make such an implication ? __label__5 Most of the editors who would care about the deletion of KiK ' s threads are the ones who would agree with him, so it ' s pointless to warn them. Hell .. come to think of it, hasn ' t KiK been all over their talk pages, with them high - fiving each other ? __label__5 no, not funny, unless you are a mentally challenged person. Why don ' t you find a better hobby where you don ' t post lies and offend the people of Tibet ? __label__5 Is there a "trap street" or "Fictitious entry" in it? http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Trap _ street otherwise you can probably get away with violating any copywrite ? __label__5 @space _ cadet: Thanks for your answer . I have two question for you . Could please let me know how the conterfactual states are generated in the first place and what is the role of \alpha s in getting rid of them ? Because I ' ve always just been taught that measurement gives each possible state with probability Tr(\Pi_\alpha \rho) for different possible projections and we never talked about inconsistent states! And the second question is in a talk by Rob Spekkens (from PI) he said he believes an adequate set of postulates for quantum mechanics shouldn ' t have this inner - outer problem ! What do you think ? __label__5 ..is indeed a sick and boring life. Where do I sign up to give you your celebratory sexin'?__label__5 I saw that you have a great answer from DisgruntledGoat. Did he not answer your question fully ? __label__5 Sure, done. (what ' s up with these 15 - character minimums?)__label__5 @Brian R Bondy: Isn ' t that a fault of the answers, and not of the question ? Or should the question be made more precisely ? __label__5 SudoGhost, just a question. Do you think that simply calling someone ' s edits disruptive is very specific ? __label__5 The name of that site is "CodeKata" not "Code Katas"; "can anyone .." is a yes / no question, what you really want to ask is "what are some more .."; the title "Code Katas" is too short and is automatically rejected by the system; greetings and signatures ("thanks!") are currently considered out of place on SO (see Meta); the [best - practices] tag is out of place, and [coding] (at least [currently](http://stackoverflow . com / questions / tagged / coding)) has lost any specific meaning (effectively all programming involves "coding", right?).__label__5 Calling all changes for vandalism just because you don ' t agree with them is NOT the way to explain why you reverts edits. May I suggest that you actually learn what vandalism actually means before you use the word ? __label__5 However, as you can see, I provided citation for my edit. Will you revert THAT and accuse me of vandalizing ? __label__5 And this is why you ' re asking all the stupid questions ? __label__5 Hi, You stated the editor is inactive, yet the editor is stalking me through MY CONTRIBUTIONS and reverting my entries and the editor left a message on the top of my TALK page, so why would you not block them ? You didn ' t even give them a warning ?__label__5 I ' m not understanding "The first paragraph of http://ww . ctan . org / starter . html needs an update." How, please ? __label__5 Do you want the complete question solved yourself? What exactly is the question here ? __label__5 Depends; do you care deeply about image policy? Or are you an incurable masochist ? __label__5 Seriously, have you tried Googling for "home automation"?__label__5 `transistors`? `transistor - level`?__label__5 I clearly provided a source that is valid, and yet a couple of hours is a big deal? Is it your way, or the highway ? __label__5 I ' m disappointed that your first response here was to revert me without discussion, and to assert a consensus that was not apparent. Before you choose to revert me again, can you ''please'' participate in the discussion at WT : RD ? __label__5 Could you provide a *minimal* example that reproduces the problem? Do you really need to load all those packages to get the bug to kick in ? __label__5 Please name one of those places. This doesn ' t make much sense; how would friction destroy a chemical ? __label__5 4 . 5 million hits on Google turning up the non - Columbia campuses. What are you talking about ? __label__5 why would you have to upload the access database? isn ' t it already on the server??__label__5 You can ' t imagine any circumstance in which you would need a simple front end to enter information into your db? Really ? __label__5 I didn ' t see your internal link, I put it back. <url> isn ' t orphaned, what are you talking about ? __label__5 Stopping code is completely different from debugging code. What ' s the real question ? __label__5 Delete, who cares. If we ' re going to delete every fair use image that ''has'' a sufficient rationale, why not change to German Wikipedia image policy already ? __label__5 My answer would be: What kind of lame ass product searches for palindromes in a string. May I take a closer look at your business plan, please ? __label__5 @Andrew Just out of curiosity, will it still work in LaTeX3? Is that even a concern ? __label__5 This strikes me as a rather weird use of templates. What is it that you are trying to achieve ? __label__5 <url> Honestly, I ' d like to know if you really are defending <url>. Do you really believe that they were justified ? __label__5 Sorry, I should ' ve made it clearer there are other text, figures and tables contained within leftbar as well - I omitted them because this was a minimal example. So that doesn ' t appear to be an option for me.. Any other ideas Stef, or others ? __label__5 You call what I did wikistalking yet these editors are allowed to do the same thing to me? Where ' s the sense in that ? __label__5 @stevenvh 1pm could be the difference between a space craft landing on mars and missing. Oh, sorry - is that one picometer or one picoyard ? __label__5 Hello? You going to answer this ? __label__5 You can ' t create a geodatabase in ArcMap, unless you are referring to the ArcCatalog window inside of ArcMap. Did you mean a 9 . 3 version of an .MXD file ? __label__5 Alright then!?__label__5 ''The sources are already there!'' Have you even looked at it ? __label__5 I have also seen people recommending tasksel. Maybe someone could explain what this one is good for too ? __label__5 Very informative about your daily life, but not a question. Can you please ask a clear question ? __label__5 @pimvdb, No I don ' t. Do you have something which could lead me to a solution or just wanna make some pointless comments ? __label__5 Not at all clear what you want to do. What is the full expected output ? __label__5 So, basically, you ' re just violating <url> and <url>. Why ? __label__5 Alf has a large <url> in Germany. How on earth do you know that he is a character "almost no one knows about" Where you get your f ' n info ? __label__5 Shudder? Why ? __label__5 Huh? A downvote? What for ? __label__5 Why did you block tanner1996 that is me I was going to choose Nascar1996 but someone else is using that name??__label__5  - 1 Why put "Urgent" in the title? Is your time more important than others ? __label__5 Shouldn ' t these be called 'dairy substitutes'? Or 'Substitutes for dairy?'__label__5 Will you have enough RAM to run the system off RAM (i . e. you can load a big compressed archive at boot time), or must it run from the flash card ? __label__5 so what is your problem? You don ' t know how to copy the content ? __label__5 This is a vague question. Do you even consider the payment and billing cycle dates ? __label__5 I was trying to be sarcastic, ok??__label__5 Misrepresenting a person ' s actions to portray them in a bad light is one of the more common (and transparent) forms of personal attack. Is that your defense for repeatedly violating <url>?__label__5 What does this have to do with Zeitgeist? I posted on your talk page because this is no longer remotely about the article, why are you continuing to quarrel here ? __label__5 oh sorry mr. wizard yeah i meant math in general - can i change it somehow ? __label__5 Is <url> what you ' re referring to?? ''One'' autograph page that he deleted almost ''five months'' ago and you ' re now attacking him as if he deleted every single autograph book ever ? __label__5 WHADDAFUCK YA GONNA DO TO ME, HUH BITCH!??__label__5 Isn ' t it? Homework is work too, or are you only allowed to get answers for free if you are actually payed to find them yourself ? __label__5 homework? or you write software for Somali pirates ? __label__5 OK done. When do I get my money ? __label__5 Saranyya: what task are you trying to accomplish? why do you need to sleep with such precision ? __label__5 No garlic? Are you sure this is a Caesar dressing ? __label__5 Do you have a specific geodatabase in mind or are you looking for general material. Same for Python: Are you looking for ESRI specific material or more general ? __label__5 And what ' s your problem, exactly? What have you tried so far ? __label__5 Why have you included the Putnam Line in the MTA infobox, when it was never operated by the MTA (excepting the Marble Hill stub, which is hardly on a par with the Hudson Line, Harlem Line, etc.)?__label__5 I find your decision to put the deepest level element as value and all parents as key somewhat weird. How are you going to know what to take from the array - key or value ? __label__5 Why do you want to cook fish for someone who doesn ' t like it? Why not just give her something else ? __label__5 @H . B.: Any chance the `f` was a unicode character instead of a standard f ? __label__5  * lol* the war against crackers is stopping our white - hats to learn the trade. Maybe the criminals will go away when we don ' t know how they do it? ;)__label__5 *"There ' s this funny gap I tried to write a paper once upon a time when I studied linguistics…"* — I think there ' s an "on" or "upon" missing. :-) You probably meant "…I tried to write a paper on once upon a time"?__label__5 Deleting Val Klassen ' s page. I redirected it to the creator ' s talkpage, wasn ' t that enough ? __label__5 @Georg: Yes. Did you read my comments ? __label__5 Not sure how this setup helps migration. Could you please elaborate ? __label__5 exact duplicate of your 5 minute old question [How to receive and use a json in ajax sended from php?](http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 4317587 / how - to - receive - and - use - a - json - in - ajax - sended - from - php). Are you for real ? __label__5 @badp I ' ve noticed you often use acronyms that I either need to look up or someone has to have you define for them. Maybe you could consider typing things out instead ? __label__5 It ' s unclear what you ' re trying to do.. why are you concatenating the strings if you don ' t *want* them concatenated? Could you give more sample inputs / outputs ? __label__5 I don ' t want to type my credentials in again. Couldn ' t you just give me an admin role and handle the authorization in your code ? __label__5 You mean that you are looking at the distribution of subsample **lengths** of subsegments covering each position, right? On the other hand (probably I ' m wrong) I ' m guessing it has something to do with the sequencing ? __label__5 Eh? No, those facts were correct, why do you think they were not ? __label__5 I am for some reason disappointed that it took me a few seconds longer to pick up the Bon Jovi reference than it did the Tom Petty one. Does that mean the terrorists have already won ? __label__5 Oh and you seem to have deleted half of the stuff on <url> .. I presume this was a mistake ? __label__5 Also, you say you are looking for a tool but it sounds like you are looking for an image format. Do you have a list of allowable formats ? __label__5 Okay, you simply posted your homework verbatim. Do you have a question of your own ? __label__5 An algorithm..for what? Mine placement ? __label__5 Do you really believe that your photograph at the top of the <url> is better than my photograph which you removed? Should Wikipedia have a dedicated sunrise article that does not feature even one single decent image of a red sky ? __label__5 Such as the redundant link to ''Roe v. Wade''? Not an improvement ? __label__5 You won ' t even let the ink on your report dry and you ' re already at it again. Care to explain finally what about the DAB needs "cleaning"?__label__5 It ' s on the talkpage - you are deleting like crazy. I can ask for a Cabral if you like ? __label__5 Looks pretty much like python problem. Why don ' t you post this to yum bugtracker ? __label__5 You have reverted four times, Sarek three times, and an IP once. Do I take it that you are declining to undo your edit ? __label__5 Why do you want to disable either Javascript or cookies, or both? What benefits will that provide ? __label__5 Of the two answers, you chose to accept the one with 3 downvotes vs. the one with 7 upvotes?!__label__5 What ' s up with all those tweaky changes? Just salting redirects ? __label__5 Why did you just do that? I am being serious - what business was it of yours exactly ? __label__5 I am not sure if I understand, it seems to me that your short answer contradicts your second answer. And, could you please provide an example of how can I use hyperref to do this ? __label__5 OK, now I see the <url>. Wouldn ' t it have been better to just say "see talk" in the edit summary so that editors don ' t think that you just moved it on a childish whim ? __label__5 Not sure if you are saying that I am beating a dead horse in raising the inclusion criteria problem again.. or if Doncram is doing so in objecting to my doing so again. Or is it both ? __label__5 @phwd: 25MB + 1 byte of zeros. does it matter ? __label__5  " Please explain in detail"? Really ? __label__5 As for restoring the image, no I will not. Did you consider that you are asking me to put up an image for which I know the "fair use" claim to be bogus, and that this is illegal ? __label__5  " Bike tires don ' t need tread to handle rain." Excuse me? Since when ? __label__5 Why would you doubt that. And for that matter why wouldn ' t you rewrite it yourself ? __label__5 after trying to edit your post I realize your syntax is totally bunked or you copied and pasted it wrong. Is this everything ? __label__5 Sorry, just to clarify: So I should try changing index . php (which is the splash page now) to index . html with the addition of the head content? Or do you mean change index2 . php to index . html ? __label__5 So what have you found so far? Or should we do all of your homework ? __label__5 <url> - "Even if he makes only a single administrative action then his having the tools is a net positive." - a single admin action> are you joking? he gets to see all the deleted data forever access to the extra buttons forever and you consider a single action as a net positive ? __label__5 It might help to give some details about the problem, other than general "it works in debug but not in release." What is "it", what is "it"?__label__5 Testing is an art more than a science. Before you go off and read a book, tell me - what are you trying to accomplish ? __label__5 I ' m usually polite, but this one seemed to need a slap across the face. It ' s .. words escape me .. mindboggling.. jaw - dropping .. ?__label__5 What problem are you trying to solve? Are you sure cron is the right solution ? __label__5 ??You wat ? __label__5 Very well I won ' t contact you anymore. Geez, whatever happen to the spirit of collaboration ? __label__5 I don ' t see any mention of Wikipedia in that article. Don ' t you have other things you could be worrying about ? __label__5 You think mapping strings to a variable ' s symbolic name is a good idea? Why in the world would you think that ? __label__5 ? EXPLAIN PLEASE! WHERE WOULD I DO THAT @ ?__label__5 If a main or major purpose of your presence here is to cause drama then I would support your being indefed. Am I misunderstanding something ? __label__5 Yeesh. Is it just me, or is it very difficult to follow these "stream of consciousness" postings ? __label__5 STOP! HAMMERTIME?!__label__5 Say what? And what does this have to do with "Happy New Year" and my pretty picture ? __label__5 miles per hour? really ? __label__5 Further: it seems to me that <url> was a perfectly reasonable dab page. I wonder why you needed to change it ? __label__5 I would say that it has nothing to do with the language, but with programming. Since this is homework, I suppose that you should know at least something about this subject ? __label__5 This should be the default behavior of a site using OG. Can you provide more details that may help figure out why this isn ' t the case in your configuration ? __label__5 WTF? Downvotes? What for ? __label__5 Actually, as a bike shop manager, that is exactly my job. What exactly, do you do ? __label__5 They did and have done, on my talk page and on their talk page and most the time im not really doing anything and i always seem to get the finger pointed at me. So what do you expect me to do if someone is uncivil towards me ? __label__5 Sigh. Did arbcomm teach you nothing ? __label__5 *"Obviously"*. Why not ? __label__5 did these suggestions help you? Are you able to accept an answer ? __label__5 What are you uploading the images for? Is it something that your theme will reference, or something that you want users to have access to and to be able to re - use images that you already posted in their own content ? __label__5 What do you mean with "it doesn ' t work" ? Does it crash (which I suspect, given your code), does it show the wrong images, doesn ' t it do anything at all ?__label__5 Is Google Voice actually a Web App? Or is it more a smartphone app ? __label__5 Remember we had the whole edit warring on Edelsten article a while back? I find it curious that a recently created account posted this <url> as their first contribution basically supporting Edelsten ' s personal website (which when you look would hardly pass <url>, I looked it at this site a while back in research and found some of the positive claims could not be verified) and wanting a complete rewrite of the article.. sound familiar ? __label__5 Holy steaming <url>. I presume you know about the <url>, yes ? __label__5 You do realise that it ' s not likely to be much cheaper unless you rebuild the wheels yourself ? __label__5 Hey, could you please tell me: if I decide to use Amazon CloudFront, what is the URL of my images going to be like? ww . mydomain . com / image . gif or an Amazon CDN domain like ww . ama - cdn . com/.. (or whatever domains Amazon uses)?__label__5 just look out or you ' ll regret ! OK, stop here, go to bed. Have U done "Tourism Report" yet ? __label__5 Except here is where the action took place, so here is where I questioned it. How about you answer it ? __label__5 When you deleted <url> did you accidentally overlook the <person> template? Or do you have some reason for ignoring it ? __label__5 I notice that many questions you have asked are simply available through a Google search. You do know about Google ?__label__5 <url> was a bit bad form. Think twice before you do it again ? __label__5 I don ' t think so, Giano. Can we just once attempt to let this pass by without calling for the heads of people ? __label__5 How are you going to power this? If it ' s off of batteries, how long would you want it to last ? __label__5 To ''Arbcom''? Aren ' t we being a bit dramatic here when other forms of dispute resolution have not been tried ? __label__5 do you know any good references for the special cases of nonexistence that you mentioned? Or perhaps, just a general reference / set of references for the order 12 case ? __label__5 Huh? Who the hell are you ? __label__5 Then maybe admins should focus on copyright infringements and avoid the leader / educator / cop / parliamentarian roles that they cherish so much. Could 100 admins handle this ? __label__5 Would you like to elaborate? How are you empowering me exactly ? __label__5 Clues? Any code??__label__5 And what operating system? and why on earth are you writing this in assembler ? __label__5 There. Better ? __label__5 Denied. I take it then that you deny responsiblity for an account (which I ' ll not name here) created just four minutes after you made that edit ? __label__5 Ridding the project from copyvio images, which could result in expensive legal battles and put the whole project at risk? You think that we should risk putting the work of thousands of editors to risk because of some image ? __label__5 What do you mean by missing file songs? Do you have items in your iTunes library that are non - existant of your hard drive ? __label__5 Just FYI, I have decided to be <url> and remove the screenshot at the top of the article. There is already a link to a mirror of goatse . cx in external links, so why force readers to look at that ? __label__5 last msg ??__label__5 Are you really denying that you brought Giano and Bishonen ' s names into this? Seriously ? __label__5 That you would consider a section that he "praised" a murderer (referenced to a website dedicated to smear campaigns, no less) as "NPOV" is astonishing. Doesn ' t <url> apply here or do you expect other users to turn the attack into something NPOV ? __label__5 Need more information — Does this happen on other WiFi Access Points? Are your iDevices Jailbroken ? __label__5 Why not K & R? Was this just an excuse to bad - mouth some books you didn ' t like ? __label__5 lol, WHAT? sry not making fun of anyone but this is hilarious the way it is asked ? __label__5 This sounds like homework. Also, Lisp is built around recursion, why do you want to avoid it ? __label__5 Your question, as it stands, is difficult to understand. What do you mean by "referred to" ?__label__5 Is it your view that the United States Senate doesn ' t have "any credibility"? Or are you of the view that some cyber truck that zooms around the WW must have bumped into the web page by "accident" and dumped stuff endorsed the United States government ? __label__5 Also, is <url> about chemistry, sociology, theology, international law, or what?? ''I'' know the answer to that question, but does the person reading the article know ? __label__5 Sure, we tell you some good ideas, you make mad money. Are we suckers ? __label__5 Boy, am I glad I don ' t have to eat your salmon. No offense, but I detest fennel, while I think dill is perfectly fine. Why would you want your fish tasting of licorice ? __label__5 This sounds bizarre. Can you explain WHY you have to do it this way ? __label__5 Um, why are you doing this with Javascript? Is that really going to be the way to put things into the database ? __label__5 Sounds like a good homework question. Does your instructor know you ' re cheating ? __label__5 .. then you have to at least meet me half - way. For instance, "''<url>'' described the episode as displaying "an exhilarating flair for rapid change of comic gear" and made commented positively on the scene." Can you see the problem here ? __label__5 Is there a reason why all of you on here seem to be anti - car? I would find this amusing, but highly inappropriate behavior from our mayor in Seattle. Why is it something to laud here ? __label__5 It would help if you described what your ultimate goal is. Do you really expect a given multigigabyte media file to have any resemblance to another multigigabyte media file ? __label__5 Wow, you waited a whole ten minutes. What ' s the problem ? __label__5 @user393043, is it that you ' ve consulted the documentation and are still confused? Or that you haven ' t even looked at the docs in the first place ? __label__5 what is the problem exactly? you don ' t know how to phrase it so cucumber will understand it ? __label__5 Those sound more like rhetorical questions than actual questions. What are you looking for ? __label__5 The text of your warning <url> made me smile. Did you really think that if China got a new Prime Minister as of today, and a female one at that, it wouldn ' t be all over the news, and the link to this person would be red ? __label__5 Firstly who are you? Secondly there seems to be a lot more people involved than just Node ue thirdly I don ' t care what his view is as long as his edits are neutral, which edits do you dispute ? __label__5 Consider rephrasing your title. "How complex is the documentation you write?"__label__5 If you completely disagree then why havn ' t you required references on other airport pages??__label__5 Joe Mills ' s answe is technically correct but I ' m not sure it ' s what you ' re after? Why don ' t you explain what you ' re trying to do rather than ask how something works ? __label__5 I gave a working answer, just scroll down to read it. Who is going to accept my answer ? __label__5 brian speaks truth. The best answer is "don ' t" followed by "why did you want to do that?"__label__5 So nearly a year later you change it all again. Why ? __label__5 What have you tried and where are you stuck? Or are you just asking *us* to do *your* work for you ? __label__5 What? No warning that gender can change ? __label__5 do you own any C++ books? if yes then why dont you try searching this in that ?__label__5 I have to protest that I find it rather meaningless to present arguments on the talk page for edits which are then blankly reverted by the likes of User : Historicar without explanation or discussion. Any suggestions for a more formal process or other remedies ? __label__5 "''Images with iconic status or historical importance: As subjects of commentary.''". Listen, it ' s just trivial to look up, could you take the care of actually reading these policies before arguing over them ? __label__5 How many times do I have to revert you before you stop? Do you want to get blocked ? __label__5 Guess that makes this community wiki. Don ' t you think ? __label__5 Ah well, if you are going to have such a bizarre flight of fancy as far as to calling it an attack page then perhaps I will remove it. Maybe you should also look at how you interact with others ? __label__5 It ' s not Bowdlerism to delete nonsensical trivia about which movies an actress appears nude in. Should we indicate what color her hair is in those movies ? __label__5 Your shortcode definition is `frame _ left`, code examples use `frame _ right`. Can I assume you have `frame _ right` shortcode defined in same way ? __label__5 Again, why are you simply reverting wholesale and without any explanation? Would you rather the article be out of line with the policies and guidelines, among other problems ? __label__5 You ask and answer your own question? Or am I completely missing out on something ? __label__5 Seems all too straightforward - I must be missing something. The only 'interesting' part is the talk of 'the reverse side of the page' which seems like a bit of irrelevant misdirection - or not ? __label__5 I find these methods quite unnecessary. What ' s the advantage of using these over the very trivial comparisons ? __label__5 Well, I bet you got that from stalking me. Are you making a template I can use ? __label__5 WHy would you need a dummy line to put a breakpoint on ? When can ' t you use an actual line ?__label__5 As @Woot4Moo points out, you have already asked this question AND received decent starting points in the replies. So what have YOU done ? __label__5 What technical reasons might those be? Do you understand how similar `require` and `use` are ? __label__5 Visual Studio 2080? Are you from the future? O _ O__label__5 Don ' t you think that "What do you miss?" kind of questions are subjective ? __label__5 ..have you considered implementing it yourself? You *are* a programmer, aren ' t you ? __label__5 The deletion review page linked above contains all the instructions for requesting a review. Why did you not read these instructions ? __label__5 Why on earth would that make for bad chicken salad ? __label__5 It is an obvious and strongly followed point that april fools jokes ''should not disrupt the running of the wiki''. Could you explain why the HELLS you coated a dozen users' pages with pictures of jimbo ' s ugly bearded fizzogg ? __label__5 @antti . huima Why? Because you can ' t solve it ? __label__5 I consider <url> to be the single most important edit I have ever made. God, what is happening with The Beatles coverage on Wikipedia ? __label__5 the singular of hierarchies is hierarchy, btw. can you edit that ?__label__5 Are you trying to learn a programming language one whole program at a time? Why don ' t you read the documentation in order to assemble your basic vocabulary ? __label__5 You should know that adding the tag "homework" to your question still doesn ' t convince many people to do all the work for you. Could you at least show us what you came up with so far ? __label__5 The review has been up there for something like six weeks, I notice. Think you ' ll be able to take care of those last couple of things ? __label__5 Wait.. "on this specific name / IP address it does not show my acceptance rate properly"? You don ' t actually know what those things mean, do you ? __label__5 That ' s "fucking consistent naming - schemers", please. Unless there ' s some actual reason for a) restriction to highways, b) infeasibly small stub categories, and c) inconsistent capitalisation ? __label__5 You also say that I am participating in a high - tech lynching. Isn ' t that what you did when you put SamuraiClinton on RFA ? __label__5 Google searches really should help you get most of what you need. What are you learning if you ' re just asking people for code ? __label__5 An empty inbox? What ' s that ? __label__5 now??__label__5 I am not sure why (1) is not a way to do (2). Anyway could you please provide more detail on how to go about doing (1)?__label__5 err.. huh??__label__5 Not that this really needs much more discussion but how did the object described as "creepy" change from the email in your first sentence to the administrator in the second? Especially when the original edit stated that the email was creepy, not the administrator ? __label__5 I don ' t understand your reference to "Appid". Are you able to clarify a bit more ? __label__5 I wasn ' t sure whether you were actually reading anything because facts seem to bounce off of you like bullets off of Superman. And you accuse ''me'' of fantasies ? __label__5 What is the problem? To identify the liars ? __label__5 Please don ' t talk like a robot. What harm did it do ? __label__5 Could you pose a question here? Is the question whether the paper is right ? __label__5 Thank you, I will give this a try tomorrow but could you please explain how to do different validations. For example validating for an correct email address, validating that there are no more than or at least XX characters, that a form field is filled out.. things like that ? __label__5 I ' m a little confused by the title, but I don ' t know much about corn varieties. I know candy corn as [this sweet confection](http://ww . reagantales . com / wp - content / uploads / 2009 / 09 / candycorn1 . jpg); is there a variety of corn that is grown that ' s commonly referred to as candy corn ? __label__5 Look dude, <url> was ALSO just deleted. What makes 2005 so special ? __label__5 That ' s a lot of complicated code for something which could probably be shown a lot more simply. Care to provide a much simpler example.. and an actual *question* to go with it ? __label__5 Howdy Resolute. Is <url> for real ? __label__5 Hey, if you want to assert that a cite does not say what it clearly does say, how about actually coming to the discussion page to discuss it, rather than treating edit summaries like a discussion space? Why the hell am I the one being accused of edit warring, when I ' m the only one actually willing to talk on the discussion page ? __label__5 Hey EAMann, that ' s great and it works. However, I ' m having trouble echoing the Title, can you put an example of how to do that please ? __label__5 I did not think that was a refinement. How were those categories not appropriate ? __label__5 You just did! What are you asking that your query doesnt already do ? __label__5 Listen, the reason I put those signs in the code 'break - clear' is because the arrangement of the blocks is ''off - key'', at least when looking through IE or Mozilla. Why are you taking them off ? __label__5 Your bot has ruined the formatting on ref 2 in <url>. Would you care to either call off the bot or suggest an alternate formatting that will work better ? __label__5 OK then. What ' s your problem with putting this in the lead : "is one of the <url> counties of the <url> and " ?__label__5 Because Wikipedia is an encylopaedia not a free advertising and self promotion venue. Why do you keep abusing it ? __label__5 I am genuinely trying to do something useful and helpful. Why are you attacking it ? __label__5 the edit just made things less clear! how does one reorder a list A to another list B when the elements may be different?!__label__5 @Kangkan: you ' re getting awfully technical, on a slippery road.. Does the application effectively _knows_? Does the application exist outside of the computer ? __label__5 That the requirements are wrong? (and the code right?)__label__5 No, Wikipedia does not consider itself (or wikis in general) as a reliable source. Surely you know such a basic policy ? __label__5 He has been indef blocked once again. I wonder how long it will take him to come back this time ? __label__5 On <url> about the Chinese sex imbalance, you accused either the OP or the first responder (me) of <url>. Could you explain why you thought either of us was advocating, opining, or recruiting, in a way that diminished the quality of the reference desk ? __label__5 Look even your 3rr message says to use the talk page. What authority does the Pokemon project have over Japanese mythology ? __label__5 Um. What do you want to replace them with? And, maybe a little context would help, no ? __label__5 According to the error message the second line of the file `/etc / apt / sources . list` is invalid. Could you please post that line ? __label__5 Lowell / Lawrence Blvd leading from Lowell to the Methuen Rotary is a device from hell as well. How many people does that short stretch of road have to kill ? __label__5 That ' s reason to expand the treatment to other painters, not to blank this one. And you didn ' t think that there would be more articles on van Gogh paintings ? __label__5 @Francesco: Why are you so against sharing the errors that you are seeing. Why don ' t you get that they are helpful ? __label__5 BTW you typo ' d the declaration of `bytes _ read`. And what on earth is "incertitude"?__label__5 I ' ve updated the question to specify that it ' s verbal feedback we need to record (sorry for the ambiguity). That noted, would such a system work with a member of the team adding clients' comments on their behalf ? __label__5 We prefer not to just do your homework for you. What answers have you considered ? __label__5 In general, in questions like this it would be very useful to specify what kind of thesis you are supposed to write: For example, BSc, MSc, PhD, something else? In particular, are you expected to do new research or "just" organise existing knowledge ? __label__5 It ' s my understanding that it is not possible to change a file ' s ctime without royally screwing everything else up. Why do you need this behavior ? __label__5 I wonder what difference it will make to your prompt? A few milliseconds cannot cause problems, can they ? __label__5 will u please rephrase the question? what do you want to do really ? __label__5 Hello??__label__5 They are completely different. Have you even glanced at the documentation ? __label__5 So you think it ' s a good idea to dump your homework here without any attempt at solving it from your side and expect us to do your work? Also: which assembler language are we talking about ? __label__5 Correcting an article to remove mention of something that ''was made up here in Wikipedia'' and does not exist in any formal definition of the article ' s subject is a furtherance of the <url> policy, not vandalism. Are you interested in knee - jerk reverting, or in actually making your encyclopedia correct and accurate ? __label__5 Just to be a bit of a stinker: your title isn ' t really a question, nor is it a good indicator of what you ' re actually asking. Consider revising ? __label__5 No problem, It was open and shut <url> issue. For your next project can you find something that doesnt make your fanclub at the Wikipedia Review angry ? __label__5 First, why are you saving an image into the database? Second, how are you loading the bytearray into the other ? __label__5 He probably couldn ' t understand the speedy notice. Then again, who knows what goes on in the minds of n00bs ? __label__5 And now you undid my declination of that one which was copyrighted. Would you ''please'' quit undoing my declinations ? __label__5 Why tag for deletion? It was obviously a new user ' s attempt at creating a disambiguation page, why not clean it up ? __label__5 So why didn ' t you just look through the source, to see if there was a number there? Or why didn ' t you simply ask the editor on their talk page ? __label__5 Wow, what are you doing that requires the microcontrollers to be so hot? Can ' t you just put the mcu outside of the hot area, maybe running wires to some sensors inside ? __label__5 You do realize this is an example? And that Ruby find this problem at RUNTIME ? __label__5 What do you mean "it just dies"? What ' s the error ? __label__5 Did you encrypt the actual /home partition using say dm - crypt / LUKS or did you have your user created with the actual home directory encrypted (say /home / jono/) with ecryptfs? In simpler terms, did you do the select the encryption during partitioning or during user handling ? __label__5 It was closed as "no consensus, default to keep". What difference does it make ? __label__5 Why did you erase the <url> page? I was working on that article, and his notability is not disputed ? __label__5 @Moron : I am not here to get my work done, but to learn better ways from other people, and perhaps help them if I can. BTW .. Why are YOU wasting your time with that comments ? __label__5 I ' m sorry, but it ' s still not clear. Are you saying that it _is_ correct grammar ? __label__5 why they have to in ONE page? why not use CSS sprites ? __label__5 As I have said before, it is an issue of breadth vs. depth. Are you familiar with such concepts ? __label__5 Major grammar reconstruction from @chills42 and myself. Maybe it ' s a clearer question now ? __label__5 <person> I find this conversation remarkable given that you have twice opted to edit war over referencing format to the detriment of an article ' s quality in the last 24 hours on <url>. What gives ? __label__5 @Praetorian: You had me into tears. I agree to you but is that going to help me with my question ? __label__5 So you reverted my edit, rstoring a badly written sentence that includes a point that is neither germane to the topic nor supported by a citation. Yeah, that really helped, didn ' t it ? __label__5 This was supposed to have been moved to <url> per the CFD. Why wasn ' t it moved ? __label__5 There is no answer without a specific question -- how is your code not working? What does the data look like that is being parsed by `split`?__label__5 What exactly do you want to know? Equipment tips, location tips, landscape photography tips ? __label__5 Can I also point out that the text that you pasted into Wikipedia is entirely inappropriate for an encyclopedia article and at best will require extensive editing to conform to the<url>. Are you going to do that editing, or are you going to leave it to one of the other 'lazy' people who edit this encyclopedia ? __label__5 Compare the two. How is the first in anyway superior to the second ? __label__5 why are you using the LET* ? For what ? __label__5 One idea: don ' t. Why do you think you need to do this ? __label__5 Okay. If something about the Camelbak bladders is better, could someone who has a basis for comparison please note that ? __label__5 eh, i ' ve ALWAYS hated 50 meter pools (200 butterfly was always the BIGGEST pain in the ass) although i really did like butterfly for some reason.. never quite got that, so was it an indoor or outdoor pool??__label__5 You might want to add some comments on what you mean by early game as this term is often confusing and interpreted differently. For example, at about what supply are you expecting the Marauder push ? __label__5  ( after multipled edit conflicts ) I checked your behaviour and your contributions myself at the time, as did numerous other admins who reviewed your edits and the block and it was subject of extensive discussion on and off - site so your suggestion that I should have checked with others is silly. You violated Wikipedia ' s policies and were blocked rightly for it; you ' ve been given a second chance and instead of being productive you come here to moan about a comment I made more than six months ago, that I still stand by, and to pursue your now year - old vendetta against Nick ? __label__5 Career advice questions like this one are too localized for this site. Please see [Are Career Advice questions useful for anyone except the poster](http://meta . programmers . stackexchange . com / questions / 588 / are - career - advice - questions - useful - to - anyone - except - the - poster / 590 # 590)?__label__5 you asked this same question a couple days ago http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 3595256 / simple - pseudocode - code - question . Did you not like the answers you got ? __label__5 P . S. Am I allowed to remove any of this abuse from my pages, or will this result in further accussations from <url> and attempts to get me discipled or banned ? __label__5 @chris I ' m missing something obvious.. Why is that annoying? Cause the page never stops loading ? __label__5 PS - surprised you didn ' t make the annoucement in your blog. Trying to fool your hordes of devoted readers ? __label__5 original article??__label__5 This question, while not an award - winner, is at least much more specific. How about we close the *other* one ? __label__5 Um, what? So presumably you ' d like to change "Irish footballer and manager" to "Republic of Ireland - born association footballer and coach (sports).."?__label__5 Refresh bug? Failure to update dynamic status ? __label__5 Why can ' t you just remove the offending phase and repost your comment? This resolves the situation, does it not ? __label__5 Your first attempt at doing this also added a <nowiki>"<url>"</nowiki> line to the article, and that ' s what triggered the bot. Perhaps you should get into the habit of using the 'Show changes button ? __label__5 So you see KV, just in case you missed the point, you are in the naughty chair in the naughty corner because of your own baloney, baloney that you bring yourself. Now, didn ' t you like that story ? __label__5 I don ' t really see that as a problem. If it ' s a fringe position why not simply state it as such ? __label__5 Shouldn ' t every professional programmer be able to do such things? Isn ' t that part of a being programmer ? __label__5 Where did you learn English? How come you ' re taking on a third language ? __label__5 Umm.. isn ' t the template page itself semi - protected? If so, then shouldn ' t it be in the category ? __label__5 wait! If you ' re doing the thesis, shouldn ' t you be the expert ? __label__5 I don ' t get it. Are you asking us to try and predict the future ? __label__5 That ' s a straightforward formula that uses basic arithmetic operations. What part don ' t you understand ? __label__5 The haven ' t first team appearances for gods sake! How can you say they deserve an article ? __label__5 During your RFA you stated that you would be helping deal with the Scibaby situation after Raul stopped doing it. Do you feel that you ' ve done what you said you were going to do ? __label__5 I am attempting to ask what I see as a fundamental question. Maybe I should have asked, "is it true that there is a fundamental computational complexity for certain math that cannot be avoided?"__label__5 I see you figured out how to ask questions. Why not earn a badge and go back and delete your "non - answer" to the TAOCP question ? __label__5 Agreed, show us what you have and seek clarification on the hard parts. You won ' t get far asking people to do your homework for you (how would you learn?)__label__5 I reverted your change to the Pet Shop Boys article - it was kind of a bizarre change (i would have considered it the work of a vandal were it not for the seemingly valid other wikipedia work you ' ve done). ?__label__5 thats the error? just one line ? __label__5 this is source code.. what is the question? Do you really think that throwing code at us will solve your problem?!__label__5 Lil - Unique told me it with the reasons of what I put in my edit summary, so if you need a better explanation ask him. I left Billboard Hot 100 as Billboard Hot 100 because that ' s the exact name of the chart ? __label__5 Why? 99% of the time you can convert well written C code to C++ code by just changing the compiler setting. Why not start using C++ code ? __label__5 Fine, but you didn ' t need to be an admin to make edits to articles. Or did you ? __label__5 Doing a redundant `atoi` after you just did `strtol` is probably the most twisted insult to the proper use of string - to - int conversion functions in C one can come up with. Why do you see the need to "re - convert" the value using the broken function `atoi` when you already have it as `val` from a proper function `strtol`?__label__5 The specific claim of Boyer ' s that you included and I deleted was that "cauchy based infinitesimals on limits". Did you see anybody else saying this ? __label__5  - why- not use sorting? homework ? __label__5 What kind of user knows JSON but not HTML? How would you put bold text in a link ? __label__5 The insertion of data into the hash seems to have nothing to do with your original creation of the hash. Why are you so reluctant to show us your code ? __label__5 I think your question is too vague. What are the properties of Irony that you want ? __label__5 Okay, so yeah, it ' s possible that that ' s his intent, but I even if it were, I don ' t see why the file has less value. Are interviews with BLP subjects not considered valid EL ' s general ? __label__5 I ' m sorry, as this question is written I have no idea what you are actually asking. Can you revise and expand on what you ' d like to know ? __label__5 Regarding <url>, the alumni should be alphabetized and Tom DeLonge did go there. Why would you undo my edit ? __label__5 Yes, I have. Did you really need to send me a reminder ? __label__5 What? Please speak brighted . Ps . Do you know gag ? __label__5 Unless you ' re building an ORM yourself, this is a strange question to ask. What exactly are you trying to do ? __label__5 Surely your classes have at least introduced basic entity relationship modelling to you already? I can ' t see them giving you this project without some kind of basic coursework.. Are you sure this isn ' t a case of just skipping read the textbook / lecture notes ? __label__5 Tom, that article is ready for publication, was written by someone else, and your changes aren ' t improving it. Did MER - C ask you to work on it ? __label__5 If people want to know more about her, there ' s the article on her. Are you really meaning to argue that people could not fully understand the concept of imagism without seeing a picture of HD ? __label__5 how did you create the plot? Through some mathematical applications ? __label__5 Why did using VirtualBox not work? Did you set up the networking correctly (adding a host - only adapter to the VM)?__label__5 What in the world are you talking about? Is this a legal question (use of copyrighted images)?__label__5 Especially considering that it took you ''a lot'' more time to vandalize the page than the two seconds it took us to fix it. What ' s the point ? __label__5 Sounds like homework. Where is your own effort ? __label__5 SE, I ' ve briefly blocked your bot because I see it ' s changing embedded links to footnotes again, against <url>. Did you discuss with anyone that you were doing this, or get permission to use it ? __label__5 Was it you who deleted the section in Victor Garber ' s article about his sexuality and his partner? If yes, what was the reason ? __label__5 You still haven ' t answered my question: ''why did you delete the article so quickly'', without even bothering to read it? And why are you so willing to back Thunderbunny and not me ? __label__5 ''SO!?!?'', what has it got to do with you ? __label__5 So what exactly was the point in moving 'Birmingham New Street Station' to 'Birmingham New Street railway station' I ' ve never heard it called that before nor any other of the Birmingham stations. Is there any need to add 'railway' to the title of a station unless it is being disambiguated from a bus station or something ? __label__5 So.. you want to implement an exclusive decision tree without using if / elif? Why??__label__5 Open a console and run `badblocks` as well as `fsck . ext4`. Do those programs report errors ? __label__5 whats the question? and why isn ' t this tagged as homework ? __label__5 any code? or do we have to guess at how you did it ? __label__5 I don ' t understand. So then you decide by yourself, and the people who stated their support for the original are ignored ? __label__5 This is a pretty broad question. Can you be more specific, please ? __label__5 I ' m a little surprised you haven ' t responded to my suggestions regarding the GAN yet. Is there some sort of a problem there, or have you just not managed to get around to it yet ? __label__5 Your scanned images provide northing and depth (and, somewhat mysteriously, easting), so you have all the coordinates you need. What exactly is the obstacle then ? __label__5 I suspect that `'apt - get install libpq - dev` didn ' t work properly, as the 9 . 04 distro is no longer supported (too old). Can you run the `pg _ config` command ? __label__5 According to your comments to some of the answers you don ' t want to use neither locks nor interlocked operations, yet you want the operation to be locked. How do you think you can achieve licking without using, well, locking ? __label__5 Hello -- I see you changed a couple of entries relating to "PALATINE, the Subject Centre for Dance, Drama and Music of the UK Higher Education Academy". I don ' t know (or even care) why that organisation chooses to refer to itself by capitalising the word, but (and I ask for information here) is there a policy that precludes us from respecting that choice ? __label__5 Your code will result in 0 . 5. So what ' s your problem ? __label__5 Does anyone know how to estimate a difference in difference regression in gretl? Do I have to work with OLS or panel data ? __label__5 no offense, kid, but you ' re trying to build a chess game and are struggling to put labels on a board? Don ' t you think this kind of program is a little bit out of your league ? __label__5 Without making a comment on the underlying coverage of the site being down, your edit comment <url> indicates a <url> violation. Under what logic do you propose that you have authority to set policy over the article ? __label__5 Under "normal" circumstances, that space shouldn ' t be there, unless explicitly added. Can you please add to your question a [minimal working example](http://ww . minimalbeispiel . de / mini - en . html) illustrating how your footnotes generate the extra spacing ? __label__5 I mean, are you adding some form fields in a node edit form, or are you creating a custom form in a different page? In the latter case, how do you get the node ID for which the form would show the coordinates ? __label__5 You want to transform a string to a byte array but you don ' t want to specify the encoding. How would you possible decode it back to a string without knowing how it was encoded ? __label__5 Dont get you. Looks exactly the same in IE9 and FF5 . 01 on Windows 7 ? __label__5 I ' ve re - read the question at least 4x ' s now and am still confused, re: if your manager has great faith in your development skills, why isn ' t your manager giving you senior - level responsibilities? Or is it just the title you are seeking ? __label__5 Its not a homework people, my colleaugue asked me to help him with some algorithm, this is only a part of that, I simplified it in terms of normal array objects, anyways the data consist of approximately 100 elements, so if you could help us with atleast a better( efficient algorithm). and who tagged this is as homework??__label__5 To clarify, are you asking "pros and cons.. of using SSL?" or ".. using SSL for the WHOLE site as opposed to just login page" or something like that ? __label__5 That is one loong problem. Can you summarize it ? __label__5  " Not a real question" ? What is the "not real" part here ? __label__5 I ' m not sure what your problem is. Aren ' t you sure about how to automatically data bind it ? __label__5 You really want off here, dont you? I ' ve already posted the incident on the incident board and you still are keeping it up ? __label__5 Is 'find . -name *.c' not simple enough ? __label__5 I don ' t see any of that in his deletion log. Would you please find out which one it was as evidence so you ' re not blindly accusing an admin of deleting something they didn ' t delete ? __label__5 What the hell? Bitter much ? __label__5 Wait. Unless ''you'' need it repaired and updated quickly ?__label__5 ChrisO, am I being paranoiac or are you undertaking some kind of campaign against me? What exactly are you referring to this time ? __label__5 Why keeps everone calling Java **methods** *functions*? Is that what they ' re teached at schools nowadays ? __label__5 You ' re doing two times the same thing (2xforeach) and the previous variant might just overwrite the option if the not set in $_REQUEST. Probably this is the issue ? __label__5 <url> - I removed a see - also to a link placed by a COI - editor pointing to a topic about himself, which duplicated an existing link on the same topic. Exactly what is <em>your</em> reason for the template on my user page ? __label__5 To what extent do you want: (a) mathematical rigour; (b) applications in particular software (e . g., R, SPSS, SAS, etc.); (c) domain - specific applications ? __label__5 Why are you debugging AutoCAD? Isn ' t that AutoDesk ' s job ? __label__5 A remarkably modern - sounding name for something being applied to articles on people who ' ve been dead for centuries. You really think it ' s appropriate for <url> ?__label__5 Sovereignty is something a thing, in this case Japan, possesses, hence the apostrophe. So what ' s the problem ? __label__5 Vandalism is putting a live AFD template back? You ' re a smart one ain ' t you ? __label__5 @LarsOn: Excuse me? I don ' t understand a word you are saying ? __label__5 Do you mean iTunes and is the metadata just in the files ( e . g. mp3s) or in some other sytem ? __label__5 Stephan, what did you mean by ''"Is English your native language? You seem to fill in a lot of things not said with your assumptions."'' on my talk ? __label__5 That sounds fine, but why would you want somebody who knows nothing about the show to write them? If you are informed about it, wouldn ' t you be a good person to do it ? __label__5 I will say this, though, in the form of a suggestion: it makes me a bit uneasy to see you so involved and sometimes argumentative in your nomination. Why not step back and let the community do its thing ? __label__5 IIRC, this is the same problem as with volume buttons on some ThinkPads.. the hardware *just does it* and then also sends out a signal saying the button ' s been pressed. Possibly you could unset the shortcut in System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts for this action ? __label__5 **@Karel** Can you expand on your comment about diffraction, perhaps as an answer? Why would the 7D differ in this respect to any other camera body - isn ' t all the glass in the lens ? __label__5 So, Pasquale, you ' re not interested? Have you ever read <url> article ? __label__5 Since your tube station articles don ' t actually contain any information, what is the point of them? Why not put them together and work them into an article that says something interesting ? __label__5 @Thomas P: hahah!! apropos Dijkstra huh?!__label__5 How can you possibly know that? Have you tried to find additional content and failed to find it ? __label__5 OK, we are talking about two remaining articles here. The categories serve absolutely no categorization purpose, so why are you being stubborn about it ? __label__5 And wasting our time as well. I can only repeat: why don ' t you do constructive work by adding contents about your beloved Makedonia ? __label__5 I understand ''your'' position, however I disagree with it, even regarding the spirit. <ins>Mostly because I don ' t see linking something as modification of the quote, therefore it ' s a moot point, even when coupled with bracketed additions.</ins> Perhaps we should see<ins>k</ins> comments from additional editors ? __label__5 Why "arrested" in the title? "Given a ticket" makes more sense, I would think ? __label__5 Also, I seem to be missing that GPS checkbox from the settings interface.. After Review i see Shutter Sound which should be on the next page according to the screenshot above. Any clues ? __label__5 Wow that is a vaguely described problem. Could you please .. give us some of the code you ' re having issue with ? __label__5 There are 788657867364790503552363213932185062295135977687173263294742533244359449963403342920304284011984623904177212138919638830257642790242637105061926624952829931134628572707633172373969889439224456214516642402540332918641312274282948532775242424075739032403212574055795686602260319041703240623517008587961789227896237038973747200 permutations of 200 - element set. You want them all ? __label__5 I often work out of Sweden and I have an excellent, free, built - in English or Swedish grammar ''and'' spelling program in ''Word'' on that computer using Firefox (as this user says she does) - red underlinings for spelling and green for grammar - which would preclude almost all of the huge amount of problems caused by this user regarding readability, or at least alert her to the very quanitity of the problems and inspire a constructive attitude as to her own capacity. Perhaps if one does not consider it a "duty" of sorts to contribute readable English here, that actually might be the problem ? __label__5 @Jason: You ' re a harsh man. Millions of people also disagree it seems - go watch the show ? __label__5 Does this only happen on multiplayer? Or does it happen on single - player too ? __label__5 What do you mean it "did not work"? What happened ? __label__5 I hardly ever agree with Jimintheatl, but that block was bordering on absurd. Fast on the button much ? __label__5 On second thought, the mix of pseudo - politeness, vulgarity and threats is..really creepy. Could ya..stop ? __label__5 @Gene Why is it that a handcrafted parser will beat a C++ parser generator? Considering that writing a hand - crafted parser is a lot of code, isn ' t it possible that the hand - crafted parser could be much slower ? __label__5 Also, how can the answer be "3"? Three banana ' s ? __label__5 What do you mean by "not a derivative of Formula 3 article"? Why did you feel compelled to remove the link to the main F3 article off the top of all the F3 sub - articles ? __label__5 Oh, be nice. Seven months, surely? :P__label__5 Wow, you have a lot of gall, given you removed the West Wing discussion from your Talk Page with the edit summary "Archiving crap". Perhaps if your going to make unnecessary comments on people ' s talk pages, you should hold yourself to the same standard ? __label__5 maxint**maxint is a number with >>750 decimals, i hope you ' re not really suprised it takes a while. Also what is supposed to happen when a number does not fit into 32 bit ? __label__5 That doesn ' t really make any sense. You have an array of dictionary objects or you actually have a dictionary whose values are all of this object type with keys like Title etc ? __label__5 Why not? And why on earth do you have these absurd constraints ? __label__5 While automatically running a rootkit removal / detection tool on a live system might help you discover less sophisticated rootkits, you should also be aware of its limitation. Assuming your system has been infested by a rootkit, how do you know that the rootkit hasn ' t been tampering with your rootkit removal / detection tool ? __label__5 Why do you need to store the whole graph in memory? Can ' t you serialize it to the datastore in a fashion that makes querying it practical ? __label__5 Ah, I agree that "comes with" is misleading. But the remote administration client binary (to which I assumed he was referring) isn ' t called Remote Desktop ? __label__5 yes, but we are hardly debating that edit that hasnt stood in the last few days anywway and certainly isnt an issue right now. What of that edit do you currently object to with such vehemence ? __label__5 There already a bunch of free IDE out there, and you want to use Visual Studio ?? You have arguments to not use Eclipse or Netbeans ?__label__5 Hi, I noticed you blocked ''BPRD Agent'' with no expiry time with reason: ''Vandalism - only account; see contribs and deleted contribs''. Um, isn ' t the Deleted Contributions only restricted to administrators ? __label__5 Comply with what your talk page says, get off and study!! Have you willpower ? __label__5 2 . 5D? Is that what people call projected 3D nowadays ? __label__5 It is an obvious and strongly followed point that april fools jokes ''should not disrupt the running of the wiki''. Could you explain why the HELLS you coated a dozen users' pages with pictures of jimbo ' s ugly bearded fizzogg ? __label__5 Let me ask you this. Assuming we take it that the player might have chosen any door to start with and the host may have opened any unchosen goat - hiding door, why do you not insist that the starting sample space must include all the possible door combinations ? __label__5 jiewmeng, you should change the question to be more specific. I think the ideal name would be "Why do I need to check if wp _ nonce _ field() exists before using it?"__label__5 smells like homework. what have you tried ? __label__5 Since when is `String` a primitive? Since when can you store primitives in a `Collection`?__label__5 Unless you provide a wikipedia article, with solid references od proof of notability of the term, I am going to delist it. I ave no doubts that there was a dilike of Portugals (like any other major nation), but was this word in notable circulation ? __label__5 You again speak of "the probability of interest", whereas I made it clear that either there is only one probability of interest, and hence it cannot depend on the door numbers, or there are several probabilities of interest, all with the same value, and hence independent of the numbers of the doors. Don ' t you understand this ? __label__5 How about this for a novel solution? The next time a banned editor posts something to your page, why not delete it yourself with an edit summary of "Sorry, I ' m topic - banned from discussing this"?__label__5 What ' s wrong with having everything look the same, the links are for the Official website of the channel so I don ' t see the problem??__label__5 I don ' t understand why Hong is so reluctant to revert unilateral changes from time - to - time when he did so frequently in the past when I or someone else who supported my edits did it. What exactly is the point in me agreeing to this if someone conveniently comes along and then starts making lots of changes that I don ' t like but Giovanni doesn ' t mind ? __label__5 Most of those differences would be identified by a grammar book as differences between British and American varieties of English. How about past participles like "proved" versus "proven" or "got" versus "gotten"?__label__5 Why are you doing this? If `rate` has a 1 : 1 relationship with `Posts` why not just add a new column to the `Posts` table ? __label__5 Please, give me example with a number, otherwise I don ' t understand. Also, would that be used as a question in that situation described above ? __label__5 sorry nothing related to the original question, but do you know anything about the australian electricity market? Seams quite stable, especially with all their coal easily available ? __label__5 That ' s correct behavior. What don ' t you like about it ? __label__5 Hmm.. I suggest you try and solve them yourself, and then post questions back on SO with your attempted solutions. Just asking people to do the work for you kind of defeats the purpose, you know ? __label__5 I don ' t understand why did you add that message at the bottom of this page??__label__5 Do we have an automated - edit - using editor who ' s decided to just stick these in for completeness' sake? Did I miss all this ? __label__5 Out of curiosity what are you actually trying to accomplish? To put it another way, _why_ do you want to do this ? __label__5 I ' m being a bit thick but what exactly is the problem..Are you getting an exception? is so what ? __label__5 well.. where is the problem? what results *are* you getting ? __label__5 did you read the "permission denied" message in that trace? why are you swallowing exceptions (`catch ( TwitterException te) {}`)?__label__5 @Darin Dimotrov: So you ' re saying that if I sent you to the supermarket to get me some beer, you will tell me you can ' t buy beer in a supermarket, while you actually *mean* you don ' t know which brand of beer to buy and whether to buy a single can, a sixpack or a tray. Would ' t it be better to just ask more specifically what I want, instead of telling me it ' s impossible ? __label__5 I see you created a nonsense article yesterday because you were bored. If I unblock you will you disrupt more ? __label__5 Can you explain what you are trying to do? The *whole point* of the Null Object Refactoring is *not* to use `nil`, so why would you want to inherit from `NilClass` for that ? __label__5 well, what are you getting instead? What is the problem ? __label__5 May I suggest you actually read the article before claiming it not to be nonsense and removing my CSD tag? Are you an admin ? __label__5 You may want to look at the nomination. What did you intend to do ? __label__5 You again? Why don ' t you go do your homework ? __label__5 OK, maybe alcohol is depressing my injoke - comprehension circuits, but I can ' t fathom <url> edit summary at all. Care to explain ? __label__5 Since you are STILL not responding to me (or the talk page discussion) and reverting anyway, I have mad you a <url> template. Post THAT on your page and leave the regular one alone, OK ? __label__5 I see that you are becoming a little bit paranoid. Do i need to do a check user for you ?__label__5 No worries dude, we ' re all here to learn :) Yeah you ' ll most likely need to set your normals. Have you just tried darkening the colour from white to a grey and see if that shows it slightly better ? __label__5 This is irritating. What browser are you using ? __label__5 Why have you restored this article deleted pursuant to a perfectly acceptable AfD? Am I missing something here ? __label__5 Could you tell which packages you have already tried? Would something like a long table, where you type each paragraph into a cell, be useful to you ? __label__5 Again, what would be the point of redirection? Who on earth is going to fall on the redirect first ? __label__5 Jeez, Joe, and I was going to suggest you hang around Andrea ' s to make sure he doesn ' t do himself a disservice.. What is this? Getting blocked is the new cool ? __label__5 I am curious why you want to do it in *TeX. What is missing in the various other solutions that use an external language ? __label__5 Why on earth have you deleted the article on the <url>? Can you please undelete it ? __label__5 @BCS - A computer - controlled analog EQ sounds oxymoronic to me. Please correct me if I ' m wrong, but won ' t any digitally controlled pot be, well, digital, and the microcontroller and / or pot introduce switching noise when you change the pot ' s value ? __label__5 This isn ' t a question about LaTeX or friends, but about installing texlive. Perhaps move it to super user ? __label__5 Yea the password isn ' t the same as the lock code and on another note, she needs a better pass code! If you have contacts and pictures synced she could just setup as a fresh phone ? __label__5 Instead of another 3O, why don ' t you put in a <url>. And no, it ' s not a threat - it ' s an observation - why don ' t you <url>?__label__5 Without participating in talk page discussion, you have deleted reliable sources, and rewritten a sentence so that it is supported by no sources at all except your personal opinion.<url> Am I missing something here ? __label__5 To suggest an answer we need to know which application you want to open this file in. Is it a command line application (aka vi or emacs on the command line) or is it another text editor (TextEdit, TextMate, Eclipse?)__label__5 The image is only used on ONE page - the site of the film. What is the problem here, and how does it violate wikipedia policy ? __label__5 If you have never got it working, why should you do it everyday? Did I miss something ? __label__5 For me, there ' s a fairly large gap between 'a web map' and a 'web - based GIS': a simple map with layer control and panning is great for many applications, but doing analysis through the web is a different scope which many web maps don ' t attempt to solve. Are you interested in doing analysis or primarily display ? __label__5 You know there ' s no excuse for the edits you ' re making related to your position at <url>. This has to go to <url>; would you like to make the report ? __label__5 @Gabi: what is the point of having n greater than say 32 or 64 ? It seems like an arbitrary and unnecessary requirement ?__label__5 Why can ' t we do like IMDB and have multiple ratings? Is it that simple, or am I crazy ? __label__5 I ' m always amazed at how many questions are similar to this. Are people itching to write code like this ? __label__5 Menu->options->keybindings? Is that not working for some reason ? __label__5 Do you want a yes or no answer? Is this homework ? __label__5 The page is getting smacked literally every half minute or so, and I think the joke ' s worn thin. Give us a break ? __label__5 Must you go through all of the cities? Must you use all of the tickets ? __label__5 Come on Mohrflies, I donxb4t understand why you insist in these edits: <url>? Why "Yugoslav" when absolutely no one uses it ? __label__5 Hmm.. the price probably depends on the Apple store (e . g. for me prices show in Euros) Which price should we note ? __label__5 Am I indeed "dishonest" by responding to you? Is <url> correct ? __label__5 What resolution? What do you consider low - cost ? __label__5 You should really use edit summaries to justify your edits. Explain ? __label__5 I ' m still scratching my head. How can this be ? __label__5 Does it not take just a bit more than someone saying they own it to remove a copyvio? As can be seen I post from Canada and what ' s to stop me claiming to be <url> and anything published in the <url> can be put on Wikipedia (or something a little more sensible)?__label__5 SO answers homework questions too? Really ? __label__5 The policy is quite clear; userids set up for the purposes of harassment or vandalism are blocked indefinitely. That said, what policy is it that you think I ' m not following ? __label__5 You see how time consuming and annoying it is when a person keeps on telling you to provide a source. Why do you want ''Michael'' to be just another compilation album ? __label__5 Why haven ' t you submitted the diet to GA? And when are you going for FAC ? __label__5 For source control reasons? Can you please explain ? __label__5 What is unreliable about the newspaper article reports about the protests in Meliti, Lofi, etc? Are you alleging that the protests against the Greek military did not occur ? __label__5 can you post an example for "language fieldset" on user - edit page, please? I ' ve created mymodule . module and pasted your code above, what to write in // Change $form array to alter form components? :)__label__5 @IVlad: yup, but the current answers fail to explain why. Care to write a better one ? __label__5 You seem to have an agenda of denying that some of the ancients were pedophiles. Why ? __label__5 I want a pony. Now we ' re done sharing what we want, did you have a question ? __label__5 I replied to you <url> but you didn ' t answer. Did you not see it ? __label__5 Hmm. You ''do'' realize that two of the "please sign" diffs are from <url>, and that the talk page is splashed with <person> which has the sig thingy ? __label__5 I am an administrator on this project and my task is to enforce these rules. Now, will you cooperate or will I have to block you ? __label__5 @Monish If you don ' t know how to implement modes of operation, you shouldn ' t be implementing your own crypto code. Why not use an existing library, like KeyCzar ? __label__5 Don ' t threaten me as that is not vandalism. What is wrong with a nude photo of Barack ' s mom ? __label__5 You ' re talking about computing the coefficients of the polynomial, right? Is this equivalent to computing the product of $\sqrt { n}$ $\sqrt { n}$-bit integers in time $\tilde O ( n \log n)$ (where $\tilde O$ hides sub - logarithmic factors)?__label__5 How about some screenshots? (Hmm, does stackoverflow have facilities for that?)__label__5 ''You wrote:'' I ' m not trying to be obtuse, but is what you ' re saying in essence that if we cannot tell whether an award is utterly trivial then that uncertainty becomes sufficient assertion of notability to not apply A7? So if an assumption needs to be made, or discretion employed, A7 doesn ' t apply because the assertion of notability has been made ? __label__5 ..I have no clue what you ' re asking me about or seeking me to do. And what does "RTL wikies" mean ? __label__5 @Andrew Bolster: "listofthings in the actual implementation is coming from the parent". Why can ' t you make this `thing` method a part of the parent and simplify this design ? __label__5 Why did you delete the article on anal stretching??__label__5 I ' m not sure how I feel about you adding coordinates to locations all over the place, but rather than get into that, let ' s start with something easy: "<url>" does not equal "<url>". Do you need me to explain why, or was that just a typo ? __label__5 # And what evidence do you have that I am committing revenge? Revenge for what ? __label__5 So, I ' m a "deletion fanatic"? Why don ' t you refrain from uncivil remarks and focus on adding sources to your unsourced stubs - help the encyclopedia rather than pissing off people ? __label__5 Agree. Who the hell came up with that in the first place ? __label__5 Why would you want to round in such a strange way? How would this be useful for money rounding ? __label__5 The article is not about this, at all. Could you explain your logic ? __label__5 I am sorry but I don ' t see how this is related to uncertainty and time evolution. Could you explain that ? __label__5 For what purpose? To make the game or to pitch it to an investor ? __label__5 **0% acceptance rate?** Really ? __label__5 You need to further explain this question to get a good answer. Given an integer as input, what is the output that you want ? __label__5 Well, if it isn ' t "ours" to feature, why is it "ours" to use? Do you mean to say that, for you, the best possible encyclopedia would not use images from outside sources, no matter their license ? __label__5 What is the actual question? And have you considered using punctuation ? __label__5 Wait you ' re writing a thesis and you ' ve got *no clue how to use it*? Wow. Usually, it should be the other way round, shouldn ' t it ? __label__5 I ' m sorry but looking back on that edit I won ' t stand for that. Don ' t you think that actually removing the edit summary was a bit.. well.. let ' s say 'abusing sysop powers'?__label__5 Please tell me when it turned out that Mach principle is wrong? And how this "wrongness" is manifested ? __label__5 I don ' t understand your example, but I ' m also not a new user. How about some examples of shortcuts / commands you haven ' t been able to come up with a mnemonic for yet ? __label__5 You have a web service for multiplying numbers? What for ? __label__5 Do I get a reference to my comment? Show me where I refuse to provide evidence backing up my changes ? __label__5 I don ' t get it. You have the `query` object already, so why not just do `if (query . id && query . foo && query . bar) { .. }`?__label__5 Hello, Vladimir Alexiev; welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which Drupal version are you interested ? __label__5 what? .. Also why you need to this via Array and not via DB ? __label__5 What ' s wrong with PowerShell? http://technet . microsoft . com / en - us / scriptcenter / powershell . aspx Why aren ' t you using this ? __label__5 Lol -- +1. What **compiler** are you using ? __label__5 I think you might be missing the point of the assignment. Hint: what can regular expressions parse, what can ' t they ? __label__5 You mean like any one of the numerous ggplot2 example charts such as [this](http://learnr . wordpress . com / 2009 / 05 / 18 / ggplot2 - three - variable - time - series - panel - chart/) or did you have something more specific in mind ? __label__5 It ' s a pretty dumb question. Who is asking you this ? __label__5 What do you mean "personal attack"? Why don ' t site what my "personal attack" is ? __label__5 hmm.. nothing??__label__5 To answer the second part of your question, you would have to define what you mean by "cook". What exactly are you doing to cook them ? __label__5 Title say permutations, but body says combinations. Which is it ? __label__5 Career advice questions like this one are too localized for this site. Please see [Are Career Advice questions useful for anyone except the poster](http://meta . programmers . stackexchange . com / questions / 588 / are - career - advice - questions - useful - to - anyone - except - the - poster / 590 # 590)?__label__5 I tend to prefer amsmath `\begin { equation*}` over `\[`, because it feels more semantic and makes the source more human - readable. But I really don ' t know, is there any difference between these two ? __label__5 Who??__label__5 Yeah. What ' s the point of reverting them again if they ' ll be removed, anyway ? __label__5 Isn ' t that a bit of an odd measure? Would you choose to become a factory worker because it ' s *easier* and *faster to learn*?__label__5 Ok with you if I play white? I suck so I should go first..and, if you don ' t agree I will crush you like a mag.. whoa power rush.. Anyway ok with you ? __label__5 Personal attacks and refusing to answer questions. What are you hiding ? __label__5 Sorry what has blender to do with game engines? do you want to use its format ? __label__5 You are being very insulting on <url>. Can ' t you just trust the strength of your arguments, instead of insulting people who are doing their best to help improve Wikipedia ? __label__5 This sounds like a job for the listings package, really. Could you post an example of your code ? __label__5 So use a merge sort. And the question is ? __label__5 Thanks, but I ' ve already read those essays. Did you have anything to say yourself, personally ? __label__5 This is subjective / asking for a list of things. Can you make this a CW ? __label__5 Now why would you do that when he specifically stated that he didn ' t want to discuss the matter for 48 hours and I specifically stated that people should come here? Did you not read his request ? __label__5 Do we have any Wikipedia regulars here who could perhaps advertise this thread at http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Talk : List _ of _ unsolved _ problems _ in _ computer _ science ? Or would it be a bad idea ? __label__5 Hey, can you block this moron from editing the IIHF Page? Or what can i do in such cases ? __label__5 You should change the title to a question. Maybe something like "What is the most popular Dictionary Application for Ubuntu?"__label__5 This problem is trivial to solve. Is this homework ? __label__5  " Oh, that", eh? So, you ''wrongly accused me of making death threats'', and that ' s all you have to say for yourself ? __label__5 Not a clue what you ' re talking about. Is PhotoshopImage a private class you ' ve created or what ? __label__5 OK, so a website might not be reliable even if its sources are (despite the convenience in showing both on wikipedia for guidance, as mere reading material). But what you failed to explain is.. WHY IS THIS PARTICULAR AND UNMENTIONED BY THE RULES WEBSITE UNRELIABLE ? __label__5 Woohoo--279 hits! Hey Scientist, is that an all - time low ? __label__5 Ow my eyes. Why are you not using `use strict; use warnings;`?__label__5 Nice project. Got any videos or pictures of the output ? __label__5 If you don ' t agree with this approach, you can ether add the references yourself, or delete the added material and I will go elsewhere and write something else, and you can take over doing the anti - tank warfare article 'properly'. Ok ? __label__5 Why the vote to close? Is this offensive to you ? __label__5 PS, I would seriously like an answer to my question above. What is your native language and where do you come from ? __label__5 thanx 4 answering my question.. i already tried ice, but after 9 degree C, LCD went off . so i didn ' t go 4 boil water but used soldering iron 2 show dat ckt is working. can u please tell me hw can i check temp of liquids like water with this ic ? __label__5 It looks like you ' re looking for free as in 'free beer', not free as in 'free speech'. Is this correct ? __label__5 Sorry, I wasn ' t sure as you said you ' d upgraded from 10 . 10, so I didn ' t know how 'fresh' your install was. Are you using nouveau or the proprietary drivers ? __label__5 This same question was asked almost word - for - word about two hours ago. Hasn ' t anyone ever heard of Google ? __label__5 Why did you delete see also section in Puerto Rico? why did you delete the political parties ? __label__5 p . s. I ' d be right that you ' re a supporter of corporal punishment, I presume ? __label__5 So you don ' t like people pointing out the errors you make? Or do you have any actual arguments to counter my post ? __label__5 Why do you want 50 threads? And what is it that they are supposed to be doing exactly ? __label__5 Hm. Are you asking to be banned ? __label__5 @torbengb: Good point. Looking at this site ' s [Area 51 entry](http://area51 . stackexchange . com / proposals / 151 ? phase=commitment), something very similar is listed as definitely off - topic ("What ' s Apple going to release in the next generation iPad?").__label__5 is it converted to hex & then the hex is stored as byte array?? but why??__label__5 The YA article is a right trainwreck, and having had to do much of the exact same work on <url> and <url>, I ' m not keen to do it again a third time on <url>, and then defend three separate articles from identical POV pushes. Thoughts ? __label__5 This makes no sense. Did you mean "space complexity of O ( n2)"?__label__5  * What* doesn ' t work? How so, and what do you actually want to do ? __label__5 Could you cite a reference please? Is the rule based on the noun closest to the verb ? __label__5 Hi, Matt. Aren ' t you supposed to be banned ? __label__5 I thought that, when some informations are mentioned about in ''desperate housewives'', it is a reliable source? So, in your way of thinking, Susan Mayer maiden name is not Bremmer or something like that ? __label__5 Sorry Rarst how do you mean markup? Do you mean is everthing where it should etc, in correct divs and so on ? __label__5 LOL the mods closed it right after we pretty much expressed our hate towards every language in existence (including English!!) Why are we in Software again ? __label__5 So you ' re interested in both Amiga computers and BDSM! Are you an atheist too ? __label__5 What, my dear, will change the fact of your poor anargumentative technique??__label__5 Why am I never asked to write a feature. Is it because "I is black"?__label__5 Not even proper sentences? Are you currently in an exam ? __label__5 No, of course I never did. So why do you keep writing about "scorning others ' s sensitivities" when such a thing was never suggested ? __label__5 Why are you using exec? And what ' s wrong with passing in a string or file ? __label__5 @:closers: why off topic? Mind to explain ? __label__5 Why are you using that in the first place? Why not `boost::posix _ time::microsec _ clock::local _ time()`?__label__5 it was a joke. why so serious ? __label__5  " think I ' ve pointed out something that is not yet satisfactorily proven"? What have you pointed out that ' s not proven formally ? __label__5 From your responses, it looks like you ' ve made up your mind to do this despite all the people telling you not to. Why did you ask the question if you don ' t plan to understand / listen to advice ? __label__5 and what is the problem? why don ' t you use recvfrom - which is the canonical way to read from UDP sockets ? __label__5 since when was north 0 degrees, east 45 degress etc. Don ' t you mean 0, 90, 180, 270 ? __label__5 Okay, I will fix the "crystals", but how do I put myself up for adoption again? Will you kindergarten <url> me through the process ? __label__5 Doing too many things at once? Not listening ?__label__5 So what ' s the question? Is it "will you do this homework for me"?__label__5 Don ' t add any more trash to the article. Got it ? __label__5 While this doesn ' t ring a bell, I find the second paragraph of this question very confusing. Perhaps you could make it a bit clearer ? __label__5 Mind <url>. Since when one edit after protection expiry is disruptive editing or editwarring ? __label__5 You deleted Ricardo Marinello. What was written in the article ? __label__5 You didn ' t answer the question though - why single speed rather than fixed? What prompted the choice (after 8 years, didn ' t you ever consider the option?)__label__5 your ' re title of your question says 'smokey flavor', yet in the body of the question it says 'charcoal flavor', which is it ? __label__5 Your obfuscation of the real issue is disengenuous; I ' m rapidly losing respect for you. Is it not Wikipedia ' s mission to scornfully snub vandalism, which is done instantly, agressively, mercilessly ? __label__5 Converting <url> to a redirect without preserving either the information or sources, & without discussion was ill - advised. A bit more care in future ? __label__5 Why would this be homework? And what if it was homework ? __label__5 I just have to ask. Why is that outside? And why don ' t you reroute it inside (the way it probably should be)?__label__5 Yes, and there has been a user from an AOL IP who has been trolling Pilotguy for weeks. Why must you blindly disagree with everything anyone says to you ? __label__5 You realize the bot maintains a separate page, right? Is it not possible that the "problem" is having the pages inconsistent ? __label__5 Are these whole frozen crab, crab legs, or crab meat? Is it pre - cooked or pasteurized ? __label__5 Subjective and argumentative? Really ? __label__5 I think the question that is most looming on my mind is.. what could possibly be the purpose of decrementing an auto increment id from mysql? Have you considered that maybe what you are trying to do is just not good ? __label__5 Anyway, the point is that the bot is editing against <url>. Can you let me know whether you intend to continue or whether we can agree that you ' ll stop using it to do this ? __label__5  " Loops are forbidden"? What sort of nonsensical assignment is this ? __label__5 what ' s wrong with this place? how has this question been up for an hour and no one has made a Bob Ross reference ? __label__5 Yep, Google, first hit, then read the paper cited. If you don ' t know what it is, then how come you know you want to implement it ? __label__5 I ' m sure. How about we let the sockpuppet investigation let us know for certain, m ' kay ? __label__5 Ugh, possibly the ugliest Python code I ' ve ever seen. What are you doing ? __label__5 ok your 1 step closer to getting help. Now what exactly is _NOT working_?__label__5 of <url> as those were just plain old copyedit (replacing begining of paragraph "he"'s with the name and a template fix). I ' m assuming you were on the cell phone again ? __label__5 Yes, the "licking my balls" thing. Why am I not surprised that that was his work too ? __label__5 What error? We should guess ? __label__5 Where is the exception in <url> for "tossing out citations and verifiable in order to make it easier for the reader"? Who are you to disagree with Nikon ' s label of "Compact Professional"?__label__5 It ' s not a ban, it ' s an indefinite block. He ' ll know about it when he tries to edit and he ' ll know that it was me that blocked him, so what ' s the pint of telling him again on his talk page ? __label__5 Could you please clarify who the new users were exactly that you considered to be part of your 'sock farm'? Or did you not even bother to research before making such claims ? __label__5 Why do you ask me questions to which you already know the answers? Is it a rhetorical device ? __label__5  " I wonder why downloading on Windows mangled the mp3?" uhh, because it ' s a toy - like excuse for a real operating system ? __label__5 Maybe if you could let us know *why* you want to do this. Just for kicks ? __label__5 That ' s the British English spelling. American English wins out on a lot of stuff on Wikipedia, so why not give a cookie to the Brits now and then ? __label__5 looks like problem with xorg or video driver. does it happen outside of the terminal ? __label__5 Also, why are you calling "use Inline" three times? Where did you get the idea to do this, and why not just call it once ? __label__5 Maybe you should consider a user name change? To, say, "Sarah 'The Hammer' Ewart"?__label__5 You wouldn ' t be allowed to ask and post comments if you were not logged in. What kind of programmer are you ? __label__5 I ' ve just reinstated the perfectly valid redirect to this. I seem to remember there was some issue years ago with a rock group of the same name, but don ' t you look at these things before you delete ? __label__5 What part of "use common sense" did not get through to you? Was it the "use," the "common," the "sense," or some combination thereafter ? __label__5 Niveau? Do you mean level ? __label__5 @Michael: What purpose does this serve besides being a list of milk? If it ' s just a list of milk, is that really useful ? __label__5  " given the following program:" I see no program. did you forget to include something ? __label__5 Sorry, almost forgot. After calling me a "child" "uneducated" and making remarks to the effect of "shouldn ' t be allowed to post on edit Wikipedia" what grounds have you got to stand on to say I ' ve made personal attacks against you by suggesting vandalism ? __label__5 What do you want if you have a path like `images / P / n / ABC - 4b . jpg`? Are you really asking to strip off the path and extension and return only the filename ? __label__5 Hello?? Are you just pretending I don ' t exist ? __label__5 All the images? In the whole world ? __label__5 yes. ambiguous dates are of little value to the intended audience. When is the cutoff for an app or library to be considered ? __label__5  " Cant see the error" ? You mean your compiler crashes as badly on this code that you even can ' t tell us what he is complaining about ? __label__5 What does the tarball contain? I assume it is the content you want to compile, not the tarball itself ? __label__5 How ridiculous is the answer you ' re looking for? Do you want a 3 - layer solution, with `i % 3` as a configurable business logic ? __label__5 Seems like a very odd design for web applications. Would you mind to explain why MVCC does not work for you ? __label__5 Can you please edit this question to make it more constructive? How many of the 6 guidelines does it satisfy ? __label__5 @Dino beytar, if you provided some more details about the purpose of this data, you might be able to get some suggestions on how to best handle it. I assume you are aggregating this data on your origin server ? __label__5 Firstly, why do you assume I don ' t care about the content, and secondly, what chance have you given anyone to voice a dissenting opinion? Correct me if I am wrong, but you don ' t seem to have asked if anyone had a problem with the merge, did you ? __label__5 Re your remarks on the talk page of 9 / 11: ''I do not troll''. Comprende ? __label__5 Unless I was forcing a developer to work in an unfamiliar language, not only would I not pay for their IDE I wouldn ' t hire them if they didn ' t have it already. You going to charge them for your time to install and configure it ? __label__5 @Sachin - please post COMPLETE real code. You do realise the snippet posted won ' t compile and run without `Config` class definition, right ? __label__5 Blocking people who disagree with your edits is a very zionist approach. Why don ' t you try instead to justify why your material should stay in the lead ? __label__5 Hmm, you are basically asking me to think positively despite evidence and knowing that over this issue none good faith on part of some users was showed in past, but ok, letxb4s see how it goes. The question then is: do you consider including the discussions with outside mediation participants that happend on those talk - pages (direktor, for exemple, has been very active and enthusiastic there lately) or only the in - mediation discussions are the ones that count ? __label__5 This is a fun question. What kind of device are you hacking ? __label__5 I guess I sent you something about the <url> project and Welsh data. But you were also somehow silent on lists like gnome - i18n, weren ' t you ? __label__5 No kidding. Perhaps you could be troubled to point out the parts you consider to be actionable as 'spam'?__label__5 @There: That ' s a lot of code to wade through. Are you saying you can ' t possibly simplify it in any further ? __label__5 Thanks, Anu. Sorry to be a php nitwit, but I tried this and got nothing: '<?php wp _ get _ post _ terms('20', 'toolkit', 'description') ?>' should I have left it as '<?php wp _ get _ post _ terms($post->ID, 'toolkit', 'description') ?>' ?__label__5 See <url> - not a good revert, and no reason given. Rollback ? __label__5 hook _ form should have only 2 arguments. Where $foo is coming from ? __label__5 I didn ' t think the people at Microsoft would be so inconsiderate to say "Hey, your database WILL get corrupt, you have to use a menu command in Access to fix it!" Would they say the same thing to people using SQL Server?!__label__5 But do you think you can take your concerns to the talk page? Crazy notion, eh ? __label__5 He keeps coming back, and keeps getting blocked again.. When will they learn ? __label__5 @belisarius done. clear now ? __label__5 Really? What is the evidence that leads you to conclude that `';'` is interpreted as a sentence terminator ? __label__5 @Ranieri, what would you suggest? JSON ? __label__5 Are you crazy down here?! What the heck is going on ? __label__5 @Oli Because I believe that you ' re a troll, could you please not take part in any form in any of my future questions? Will you be able to respect my wish ? __label__5 Liked that <url> I tore into that spammer? Got a box with a gun ? __label__5 Why exactly would a space - inefficient trie be too slow? Are you expecting to load more data than available memory and thus creating many page faults ? __label__5 As you can see from the answers so far, it ' s not quite clear what context we ' re talking about. Could you please clarify ? __label__5 Can I get some time to finish what I am doing without everything being deleted??__label__5 There is still ambiguity - `1 3 5 4 2` is zig zag according to YOUR description of the problem, but NOT according to the topcoder description. Do you see why ? __label__5 Seems like a rather big project. From what I can read, you have no experience in programming ? __label__5 Could you explain how data were collected and what they intend to measure? Are the different columns of your data matrix independent measurements ? __label__5 This question basically tells me nothing about what the actual problem is. Also, what ' s a "pathway"?__label__5 I ' m sorry I ' m not sure do I understand you. Are you looking for something like [OSSTMM](http://ww . isecom . org / osstmm/) or the software which would support logistics / management side of the pentesting project ? __label__5 what a hypocrite! Doesn ' t his solution (steps 3 - 5) also apply for both of his statements ? __label__5 Give us more details about your setup. Are you using Wubi, Partitions, or haven ' t even started yet ? __label__5 That incident is already mentioned in the <url>. Why do you insist on redundantly adding it ? __label__5 So, what specificaly is it that you have problems with? Is it that you don ' t understand the assignment ? __label__5 How can anyone analyze the page if you keep deleting the content? <url> 01 : 28, 18 December 2006 (UTC) Are you afraid someone might vote for it ?
