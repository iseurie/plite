May I venture to enquire why ? __label__1 Hello, I ' m a sysop in <url>, I ' m creating an Upload page like English Wikipedia <url>, I ' ve changed file MediaWiki : Licenses / vi - ownwork corresponding to Own work options, but they still display Media : Licenses information. Can you know what problem is ? __label__1 Okay thanks. Any easy way to determine this ? __label__1 I see you have `Debug` enabled during `MIME::Lite->send`. Can you post that log ? __label__1 Something of a non - sequitur, but could someone (OP, mod) please edit this and add ", oh my!" at the end of the title ? __label__1 For #2: May there ever be two edges directly connecting node _X_ to node _Y_? For #5: does this mean that properties A and B are numeric / summable ? __label__1 Perhaps also a bit of information about the parameters to `Field()` would help. Also, are you trying to use a 1D or a 2D array to store the fields ? __label__1 @Shane I ' m using Rscript. How are you loading your scripts ? __label__1 Hey, I like your sharebox a lot. What do you think about trying to make it a <url>?__label__1 Can you post this somewhere with a live URL? I don ' t see a background image referenced in the CSS..?__label__1 You are correct Yi Jiang, we are only using HTML for his web developer. What do you mean when you refer to "If so, then why add all the weight of a rendering engine when you can do the same natively?"__label__1 On another note, I ' m going to assume that you were the one who also added ridership data for various LIRR stations, am I correct? If so, could you kindly point me towards your source ? __label__1 You mentioned an hour long video that included about 25 minutes of Will Wright just talking. Do you know where I could get a copy of this ? __label__1 What if you added a button to the results page to go back to the form? Or wouldn ' t that overcome the users' urge to use the 'back' button ? __label__1 Yes but making it cross browser will be headache. I have old code somewhere, untested for long time - want me to post it anyway ? __label__1 you need to clarify the question. Are you talking about generating a DC voltage from the PWM ? __label__1 Great job. Any chance of a full date of death for him ? __label__1 I wish I could help you, but I know very little about Iranian rock music. Have you asked any other Iranian members ? __label__1 A follow - up question: How far away from the true ridge does the watershed extend, using your looser definition? Is it the entire hillside entire you enter a channel ? __label__1 A challenge for you! What do you think about creating a template for convoys and a list of convoys ? __label__1 Do you know how to make the 'All Star Template' appear only at the bottom, as well as the 'Confirmed future sites', so the actual table appears at the top of the page??__label__1 No worries found it.. but yeah.. We need a new Foo ' s pic.. Does Flickr have fair use licenses ? __label__1 What does the label actually show? Are you sure you are setting the value *before* accesing it ? __label__1 Hmm, still don ' t quite see what you ' re aiming for. Could you perhaps explain where you *think* things can be generalised / abstracted (at least verbally / in pseudocode)?__label__1 Since no third - party app knows about any other, what possible touch - up of "reverse" are you doing? Is this something that ' s better done with a TemplateContext ? __label__1 My question about the truncation operation is to understand the generic algorithm for applying a ring (or un - ringing) a Dynkin node. What method (code) do you use to get the higher dimensions truncated based on the Coxeter Dynkin ringed nodes ? __label__1 POST implies you want to send some data to the server. Why wouldn ' t you just use GET when all you want to do is GET data ? __label__1 Shane I reverted the edit you made this moring <url> but on second thought I would like some advice. Is it implied in stub that they do not have references or is it appropriate to mark stubs as requiring a reference ? __label__1 The content has recently been added to <url>. Would you consider changing your vote to delete ? __label__1 How would look your formula like after removing one, two, or all connectives? Could you give an example ? __label__1 Yes. Need help ? __label__1 How exactly should the effect look like? Fading out at the borders or something similar ? __label__1 Yeah you answer did help me. Please can you give me a little bit more details about 'creating a custom admin page that allows the user to add static sections via AJAX with links to their edit pages' (if there ' s no Static Content menu in which other ways the user can create the content)?__label__1 Not according to the history on <url>. Can you give me a link to follow, please ? __label__1 Sounds interesting. Could people keep me in the loop as well ? __label__1 I noted you just blocked 67 . 165 . 219 . 110 I stumbled across his "fun", but since I ' m new, I had no idea who to report him to. For future issues, is it at AN - V ? __label__1 As I ' ve only ever tagged one page for speedy deletion before (and that was an obvious cut - and - paste copyvio), I just want to make sure I tagged it properly. Was db - 1 the right tag for <url>?__label__1 I ' m really very sorry, but no, I ''didn ' t'' know, didn ' t get a message saying that was wrong. Where was it ? __label__1 Isn ' t some kind of curve inherent in using non - Euclidean triangles? I suppose intuitively, I ' d expect each edge of a triangle to be part of a great circle - are these "bulges" relative to that ? __label__1 OK, same situation here :-) Marskell and I agreed on a proposal that would initially just give us some backup on the day - to - day stuff, not necessarily closes, but to work in to people who could help when we needed time off. Is it OK with you if I go ahead and propose that to Raul ? __label__1 Saw your note on Herbythyme ' s pageu2014this is great! How come this isn ' t more widely "publicized"?__label__1 Just curious: why should you want to use live wallpapers ? Doesn ' t that drain your power much quicker ?__label__1 It looks like the current version of <url> has been reworked since when you built it in July 2005 and references have never been provided. Do you have any references you can add to the article ? __label__1 Can you estimate what the warmest in - rain air temperature is in which you could or would wear it for an hour ? __label__1 I ' m not sure that I understand the question. Can you please elaborate ? __label__1 I ' m sorry, but I ' m unlikely to have time to help. Maybe try <url>?__label__1 I ' m sure that this is not a useful place to discuss the merits of your topic ban, which I think would need a wider audience to overturn. Perhaps you could make a request to the arbitration committee ? __label__1 Have you tried stepping through your program with a debugger? Have you tried adding useful `cout` trace statements to investigate what ' s going on ? __label__1 I tried a white map on <url> and a light yellow - pink on <url>. Which do you think looks better ? __label__1 Regarding our WikiProject discussion about airport naming, I am unsure about Wiki etiquette - should I edit your sandbox with links indicating the common name (i . e. airport even though it ' s an aerodrome) or should I list them on my own talk page ? __label__1 I have started it at <url>, but as you can imagine there are lots of gaps! I think the first steps are categorising articles and getting a parameter added to <url>, what do you think ? __label__1 If the deleted image only has a single character then no need to restore. Would you be against adding an image illustrating the 4 protagonist dinosaurs ? __label__1 XD Yes I am. What is your username ? __label__1 The link you gave isn ' t a repository, but a page with links to the repositories for various fedora versions. Did you try those links, or did you somehow try to use the link you gave as though it was the repository ? __label__1 Well, when you call `new Class();`, it returns a pointer to the location of that instance of the class. Is that what you are referring to ? __label__1 @svante - I ' m fine with that! Care to give any feedback on what I SHOULD be using ? __label__1 Could you expand on what doesn ' t work? Is there an error, etc ? __label__1 What URL are you trying to access? Or is it all of them ? __label__1 Usefulness and acceptable range of RMSE depends on the goal of the enhancement you are doing and the contents of the image. Can you tell a bit more about that ? __label__1 With the detail you ' ve given that sounds OK to me, though you should note that MAC addresses can be changed / spoofed, so I guess it ' s a risk based on how tech - savvy / desperate your client is. If you trust your clients anyway, why not just use an "honesty" approach where they tell you how many times they have it installed and pay the correct fee ? __label__1 In terms of suitability for an article, as I understand it, Merrill ' s "claim to notice" is due to the company (work done by SOM, size of SOM, etc), and also because of the important changes he made to that company. Is that roughly correct ? __label__1 @polyg: As I mentioned below, I ' m not an expert in Java. Why are enums more powerful in Java than C++/C#?__label__1 somewhere from the run dialog of JDeveloper. But are you sure you want to use this IDE ? __label__1 Consider these numbers to be the production count of a company over a period of 8 years ( 200 to 2008 ) , i . e, Production Count ( 200) = 1, Production Count ( 2001) = 2 .. Production Count ( 2008) = 60; So the goal here is to find the time period which saw the highest increase in the production percentage, That could be from 200 to 2001 or 2001 to 2003 or even 200 to 2003! Do you need further clarifications ? __label__1 Sure! How could I have missed that ? __label__1 I edited my question. I know eval() evaluates a string as code but are my examples above correct ? __label__1 Since in essence the nesting in a lmer makes it a repeated measures design is there a way in which your question about the appropriate confidence interval around the effect size is related to the question in repeated - measures ANOVA about which measure of effect size to report? Specifically, it is unclear whether the error term should include subject variance or not (etc)?__label__1 can you add some details about your platform and which programming language? you mention CGImageCreate, can you include a url ? __label__1 Which php . ini file did you change the setting in? Did you restart the server after changing it ? __label__1 Not exactly clear what you mean: Wisconsin CDPs are just like CDPs in the rest of the country, and they already have <url>. Or do you mean something that I ' m missing ? __label__1 Are words allowed to overlap? What is the desired answer if `dictionary = {"abc", "bcd"}` and `word = "abcd"`?__label__1 I am not familiar with the credit card / porn star identity incident you mentioned in AnonEMouse ' s RFA, but I would like to take a closer look at it. Could you provide some more direct diffs related to Mouse ' s involvment ? __label__1 Great answer. Is it enough for the jam to reach 220??F or does it need to stay there a while ? __label__1 That does sound odd. Is there perhaps a threshold setting of some sort ? __label__1 Do you mean article edits with sock puppets? Could you give me more precise examples ? __label__1 Sorry if this is a stupid question. Is the output exactly `<%= debug @articles %>` or is the output actually a yaml formated object ? __label__1 Your title talks about arrays, but in your code sample you ' re applying `gsub` to a single string (you ' re applying it to the whole string btw) and then taking the first line of that string. Could you please clarify ? __label__1 @damonokz Sorry maybe I misunderstood something but you said "Anyway, its a relief that somebody understands the situation". So the guys here who are trying to answer your question and spending their own time don ' t understand the situation ? __label__1 ""This waveform resembles a frequency modulated sinusoidal wave (only it is not)."" Is this a joke ? __label__1 Thanks for the tip. What is the best way to freeze it, though? I mean, aside from what I make with it when I finally decide to eat it, how do I best store it for another day ? __label__1 The proper title of this image should be Eszopiclone . svg, since it depicts the S enantiomer. Could you change the title so I can upload an image of the racemic compound instead ? __label__1 @Shinto Sherlock: You just *answered the question*. Why would you not post it as an answer ? __label__1 Sorry, I dont quite remember what we were talking about. Can you tell me what you were / are confused about ? __label__1 The commenter is merely saying that the solutions hard code the "multiples of three and five" conditions. What if we wanted "multiples of four and nine"?__label__1 Hi! Do you know where the info comes about <url> concerning <url> and the other town ? __label__1 Nothing wrong in your code, but what does your xml look like ? And what do you call debug mode ?__label__1 I uploaded a new version of the Desert Storm map, with Egyptian, Syrian and multinational forces labeled (<url>). How does it look now ? __label__1 Writing your own utility to parse this would not take long at all, probably 15 - 20 minutes - is that an option? What language would you use ? __label__1 Sorry about that. Better luck next time, OK ? __label__1 I know that "click here" should be avoided, at least for semantics. Can somebody please explain "It ruins a perfectly good SEO opportunity"?__label__1 I believe you wanted to find out which party the PP was? Well i ' m sure you ' ll be able to find it at http://elections . uwa . edu . au / partysearch . lasso - my guess is that it could be the Progress Party, who ran in the 1977 WA HoR election ? __label__1 Hi Kathleen - It looks OK to me; all I did was change the template wording a bit and add parent cats to the stub category. What problem were you having ? __label__1 What happens if you put water into the drain pipe without the dishwasher installed. Does it drain ? __label__1 Wow! How did you find this ? __label__1 What value does CreateProcessAsUser return? If it returns zero (indicating an error), what does the GetLastError() function return ? __label__1 I presume you have no access to the ESRI REST server / cannot make changes. Do you have rights to download and modify the data ? __label__1 Is the italicized text the only error you get or are you getting any other errors? Or are your breakpoints just not being triggered ? __label__1 Also, what about duplicates? It ' s not explicit, but it seems like you want to remove them ? __label__1 I ' ve heard you say you have quite a collection of dog books. Any chance you could list them for us ? __label__1 Hi I am still not clear if you have a commons account or not. If you do can you say what the name is ? __label__1 @ yoda ..Done ! i edited it :) hey are you personally good at image processing in matlab ?__label__1 What do you think? Perhaps the coat of arms field can contain the picture that the article ' s family name infobox already has ? __label__1 Im sorry to see that you withdrew. Maybe next time ? __label__1 I see a "remove protection" tab on the <url>, which tells an admin that the article is protected. Are you still able to edit it ? __label__1 Where ' s your public key token for the assembly? Are you adding these manually to your config file or through the IDE ? __label__1 I moved ''Engine Arm Aqueduct'' to <url>, because there seemed to be much more content about the canal than the actual <url>. Does that seem reasonable, to you ? __label__1 My stock Android keyboard works with text prediction. What ' s shown as the name in Settings -> Locale and text ? __label__1 It is disputed among admins regarding the protection of userpages, although the policy says that users can have their user / user sub - pages (but not the talks) semi - protected if the user requests it. Are there other subpages of yours that you ' d like protecting ? __label__1 Sounds good. Could you drop Fritzpoll a note ? __label__1 have you tried any other patchlevel of 1 . 8 . 7 ? ruby - 1 . 8 . 7 - p352 for example ?__label__1 There hasn ' t been much progress made in the last three days. Is anyone interested in responding ? __label__1 Over at <url> you ' ve changed my request for protection on <url> to a request for unprotection. Is there a reason for that, since the page has yet to be protected ? __label__1 I don ' t follow you I was not aware that my edits were vandalism, I was editing according to what had (it appeared to me) been agreed on the talk page, but additional material had been inserted (that had not been agreed upon) that esentialy said the same thing (and was not supported by the sources) that had caused the origioanl disagrement. I think I may have mis - understood you point, are you saying that I can only revert three times if its vandalism, or that my edits were vandalims ? __label__1 Is it popular open source web application? Can we know the name of open source ? __label__1 I see. Was it talking about that one specifically? :)__label__1 Can you remember any other specific ingredients that might differentiate it ? __label__1 I haven ' t heard from you in sometime. Como estan las cosas ? __label__1 can show your app please ? Are you looking for something similar to this http://mrdoob . com / projects / harmony ??__label__1 Who is the author, where do you cite it from? Maybe he is known ? __label__1 What have you tried? What didn ' t work ? __label__1 Are you studying computer science? Whats your background in programming and computer science ? __label__1 Can you clarify the question? Are you asking why member variables must be declared outside the scope of a function, or are you finding that your constructor isn ' t working as expected ? __label__1 Is it that the browser itself is taking a long time to load the page? Or is the dev server process itself just taking an abnormally long time to load ? __label__1 I notice you occasionally use that remark in your edit summaries. I understand simple stuff like r and c. What does awai stand for ? __label__1 Works like a charm here using XE. Do you have specific steps ? __label__1 I assume you ' ve already considered using the Featured Image and decided it doesn ' t meet your use case? (Are these a large number of existing posts, or are you designing a system for posts to be added in the future?)__label__1 I say - are you a sort of picture finder? You couldn ' t find one of John Bowlby could you ? __label__1 I agree with viksit- it sounds like a hashtable is what you want. Is there a reason you want to use a B - tree ? __label__1 I confess, no. What ' s exactly to be read in the docs you are referring to ? __label__1 I ' m afraid I don ' t know what you mean Arcayne. What comment ? __label__1 I found <url> whilst looking for something else. Any use to you ? __label__1 @Tsuyoshi - I have never ever heard 'of course' pronounced with /f/. Are you talking about 'off course'?__label__1 It ' s not exactly clear what you ' re trying to do. Do you just want get the text of the HTML table without the HTML tags ? __label__1 I began to make an article for <url> but found that one already existed but was deleted. After reading the deletion log and seeing that it was speedy deleted for a7, I think I can write an article that establishes notability, but am I required to get administration approval before recreating a deleted article or can I just create it on my own ? __label__1 i have used zxing library before but never tackled the code in it. Is this the most appropriate way ?__label__1 Im in Mac OSX, so I guess it ' s working as it ' s supposed to. Is there a way to change this ? __label__1 Hi John. Do you have any more edits to make before I start the merge ? __label__1 I was in doubt too, but when dealing with such incomprehensible concoctions I prefer to err on the side of BLP caution. Would you like it userfied ? __label__1 I would specifically appreciate an outside view at the thread <url>. What do you feel is the appropriate action ? __label__1 Hi, you ' ve done a lot of work on comparing FA country articles. Are you aware of any country that got special praise for the selection of images in the article ? __label__1 Is this for homework? What have you tried so far ? __label__1 Greetings, I ran across your 2008 article <url>, and the footnotes are done manually vice the usual Wiki way. Any chance you can go back and fix the footnotes ? __label__1 Thanks. Anything else ? __label__1 So the usages are quoted .. and from a 34 - year - old *professor* no less!??! What is this world coming to ? __label__1 i know this doesn ' t help your problem but it ' s another corner case: what if two different cells want to swap with the same one? will one swap and then the other swap with the one it didn ' t intend to ? __label__1 I hope I don ' t upset anyone by jumping in univited, but why are self - created images any different than those found elsewhere so long as they comply with all of the non - free content criteria? Is this caveat hiding in a talk page archive somewhere ? __label__1 Thanks for doing the tidy up on the SSC page. One question, what was the reason for removing the item about the Simon PG ownership of the buildings, as well as dropping the link to the company ' s WP entry ? __label__1 <url> as having been deleted via a deletion discussion, however I can ' t find any such Afd. Do you know of one ? __label__1 Can you clarify the question, please? Is it that you have an account with Last . fm, but not a paying account ? __label__1 Is `A` a global variable? What is x ? __label__1 Just got around to this on <url>. Do you still need help or is this sorted ? __label__1 How would you materialize the debug session? There shall be some data initially and how are you going to feed the data ? __label__1 Good idea.. Perhaps though you could also make a list of kings on that page??__label__1 I have left a comment on the Talk page under that section. You haven ' t said much there - is there some place where you present your view with a little more detail ? __label__1 Check if the text simply contains some Chinese characters (with other non - Chinese characters)? or is comprised entirely of Chinese characters ? __label__1 I think I lot of the things on the Methuselah page are very interesting, but perhaps should be transferred to the Biblical Generations article, if they touch on more than just Methuselah. Would you agree ? __label__1 Sure it ' s possible. Do you have any prior experience in Python ? __label__1 Same problem here. Can you still remember how you got rid of it ? __label__1 I note that you ' ve edited since this was brought up here. Could you please respond ? __label__1 Thanks for the explanation. Might not Aethelred have been following the example of his father, who also gave his sons the names of former kings ? __label__1 Thanks for the reminder, not forgotten. Any opinion, comments ? __label__1 I was confused by "darkhad" being translated as "sacred ones", when the usual translation I know is smith or craftsman (kind of). Was I at least correct in being confused ? __label__1 Hello, sorry I probably should have asked first, but I thought it might be a good idea to nominate one of the images you uploaded, <url>, for featured picture. I hope you don ' t mind me taking the liberty, as it were ? __label__1 What kind of processing will you perform? Is it just a matter of setting up data structures to model a family tree ? __label__1 What happens when you just use a different algorithm to determine file names? Does OpenOffice . org care ? __label__1 Are you unable to change it back? Or are you just curious as to how it got changed ? __label__1 In numpy, your array is 2 x 5, isn ' t it? And am I understanding that you want to extract a column slice as a column matrix, rather than a vector ? __label__1 Here ' s a simple example based on what you provided: http://fbrell . com / saved / 58a66f765babcdd3d7b452afe02b4e41 -- works fine for me. Maybe you can provide some more details ? __label__1 Try the same thing using SciPy? Save to text first and then use Asymptote or convert unix command ? __label__1 I think there are enough clues ;-) Seriously, it could be ''Engine Arm Canal'', if you wish. Is there pedestrian access from a nearby street, or only along the towpath ? __label__1  ' Best' is rather subjective. Do you mean easiest to use, fastest, or most elegant ? __label__1 Hey. I ' m proposing a <url> - would you be interested in coming along ? __label__1 Hi, would you have any objection to renaming the sub - categories of <url> to look more like the articles which describe them - i . e. <url> -> <url> and so on ? __label__1 You have listed it as no source but the author asserts own work. Could you please clarify this ? __label__1 Thanks for your help on <url>. Any advice on edits we should make to get it up the quality scale ? __label__1 In my opinion that would be more constructive way to approach the solution. What do you think ? __label__1 Oh I see; I misread it, sorry. So you want to know number the number of equivalence classes (via their language) of DFA of size n ? __label__1 You left some comments at <url>, specifically about referencing. I ' ve added some references to the sections you outlined and was wondering if it addressed your concerns enough for you to give the article your support ? __label__1 I put both in the first sentence, to show a range. Is that OK ? __label__1 What platform will you be running this client on? iPhone / iOS or Mac OS X ? __label__1 Could you next time create 2 posts if you have 2 questions? Please ? __label__1 what language? You mentioned pointers.. does that mean you ' re using C++?__label__1 pdfTeX does not alter images. Perhaps post the problematic file somewhere we can get at ? __label__1 Not that I know of, but it ' s probably time it was. Want to start a discussion somewhere ? __label__1 I believe in previous versions of the article, the title of that section was "Left - libertarianism in political philosophy". If it were changed back to something like that and moved to the top, would that be satisfactory ? __label__1 Is `getFreeCrawler()` synchronized? In which line does the error occur ? __label__1 Thanks for the link to the Flag template WikiProject at the MoS discussion. Has there been much discussion at the WikiProject about the limits / usefulness of flag icons ? __label__1 The resulting table shouldn ' t have that primary key. What provider are you using ? __label__1 Are you trying to simulate how it would look if someone pointed an ordinary movie projector at this surface? Or are you trying to adjust what you ' re projecting to try to cancel out the deformations in the surface ? __label__1 Hello. I was just wondering, is it really fair to delete an unintentional duplication of a deleted category without a formal CFD submission ? __label__1 If all you want is just to make money, you ' d better stay off from programming. How about becoming a popular actress ? __label__1 Sure, I ' ll have a look at it. It looks like it needs a bit of a copyedit though, hope you don ' t mind ? __label__1 Does the route work if you run the same reload _ routes function during application execution? That is, does it work if you just stick that line in while you ' re in dev mode ? __label__1 This is certainly a tough assignment if you aren ' t good at programming. Do you have to code your own quadratic programming optimization as well ? __label__1 I have no libGL . so(.1) in `/usr / lib` - only in `/usr / lib / mesa` and `/usr / lib / nvidia - current`. Can you please add the output of `update - alternatives --display gl _ conf` and `ls -al /etc / alternatives / gl _ conf` to your question ? __label__1 I don ' t understand. That call stack is all about the Debug Help Library; is this only happening when it is being debugged ? __label__1 Can you please explain what it does ? __label__1 @DSchultz Tried adding the 'ww' (no luck). How do I URL encode it ? __label__1 @shane87: How did you generate the managed type of the `photo` variable you are calling through? What is the IDL of the COM method ? __label__1 Are you using fresh herbs or dry? What is the dish ? __label__1 Depends, where will you base the generated code on? Database, XML, Diagram ? __label__1 Any ideas on how to create from scratch?? like what is required, ect ? __label__1 Can you describe the problem in more detail? Maybe upload a screenshot or two ? __label__1 Sorry, I got a bit confused. Actually, how did you build a station with this configuration ? __label__1 If you need wide browser compatibility, you ' ll have to use JavaScript. Would you be interested in a JavaScript solution ? __label__1 I always forget testing things in IE. Just out of curiosity, did you test this code on other browsers ? __label__1 What is the dynamic range of your camera ' s sensor (how many bits per pixel)? Can you adjust the pixel format of the raw file ? __label__1 I took a quick look and I ' m not up to reading through it properly at the moment. :) I ' ll be back on here tomorrow morning and I ' ll have a look then, if that ' s OK ? __label__1 I noticed you had 3 answers. Did they give you the information you need or did they not answer your question in full ? __label__1 Hi, congrats on your admin promotion, but in preparing the short note about it for ''The Signpost'', I ' m puzzled as to "the backlog", which appeared in your RfA text. Is it a copyright backlog for images ? __label__1 I see that you don ' t have an account linked to the Wikipedia email. Would you be able to send me a message so that we can talk off Wikipedia ? __label__1 Katy, good buddy. Is <url> your lost article ? __label__1 Thanks for letting me know. btw on that page I found <person> but before adding that to the list I was wondering if the templatelist on the project should go so deep into detail or if it just stay Germany wide ? __label__1 I met the same problem. Have u resolved it ? __label__1 Sorry, but I don ' t buy it. Why should we be sheep because exceptions didn ' t exist in PHP over a decade ago when classes were first implemented in PHP `4 . something`?__label__1 This page, which you recently edited on, is constantly getting vandalized by a rival school. Could you please put an edit lock on the page ? __label__1 Regarding <url>, <url>, <url>, <url>, <url> and <url>, may I redirect them? Should I leave the merge tag on the talk page ? __label__1 ..? Can you please be more specific about your question? You talk about Samsung graphic customizations ? __label__1 I ' m starting to feel that the problem arises with interactionPointData, since this method does not own it. Since I am pointing to it with model, will releasing model cause havoc upstream ? __label__1 It didnt work when I replaced Lbs2 by t. Lbs2 is the model that has been created to store lat, lng and body. Can you please suggest some other changes should be made ? __label__1 I agree with you in that this chapter has no place on <url>, moreover its inclusion there seems highly suspicious.

Describe more what this actions do, maybe you can replace them with observer class or delayed _ job ? __label__1 I don ' t see you around much these days. Busy with non wiki life ? __label__1 Just a note, the code snippet actually works so I am thinking that there is something inside my SomeObject (the full code and not the snippet) that is causing it to autorelease. Can an object autorelease itself without have been told to ? __label__1 Are these two more articles that should be moved on January 1st?

Are there specific points in the article that you believe are repetitive ? __label__1 In my opinion, if the variable is significant (p<.001) without imputation, and you have enough data, that is reason enough to leave it alone.

Does any one want me to add anything more in the script??__label__1 Hi, <url> moved <url> to <url>, and then a bot came in to correct a double redirect so that the page can ' t simply be moved back again.

Is it possible that isAuthenticated() is then returning true meaning that continue simply causes the loop to exit ? __label__1 I hope I ' ve translated this okay; please check it.

Would you add Straka ' s signing with a Czech team into, to his page ? __label__1 Hi Steph - this would be a fine article, but its already pretty fleshed out - do you have a specific sub - topic regarding propaganda films that you ' d like to write about? Have you found some research about propaganda films that you ' d like to synthesize ? __label__1 It ' s unclear to me what you mean with "rule engine" in your question. Could you elaborate ? __label__1 How are you calculating your total number of nodes? Also, your diagram shows an unbalanced tree, may I assume this is what you intended ? __label__1 I haven ' t ever experience `GetClientRect` returning anything but the full client rectangle, no matter what overlaps it or if it is fully on - screen. Are you sure ? __label__1 Glad to see that link go blue. Have you seen the <url> on Google Books ? __label__1 Hi, I see you were involved in creating the ship infobox.

I mean, using your example input, is `3 , 3 , 3 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2` acceptable, or is `2 , 3 , 2 , 3 , 2 , 3 , 2` preferable, or is `3 , 2 , 3 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 2` the ideal case ? __label__2 I ' m sorry, but I don ' t think we can help you with this request. We ruled recommendation questions to be out of scope of the site; this includes "is there such a thing as X?"__label__2 @davebug: "So, professor, you ' re saying the etymology is.." "yes, people thought it would be funny to misspell everything. ne1 haz more questions?"__label__2 King Kong is a notable legacy of Beauty and the Beast.

SO ? __label__2 Are the rest of your ProcessStartInfo values correct? Particularly, the starting directory ? __label__2 What is your objection? Would a split address your concerns ? __label__2 Do you want them one at a time, maybe alternating chars and ints, or do you want a parameter that tells how many to generate? What do you want to use the randomly generated values for ? __label__2 I plan on getting the page up at some point this weekend, no latter than Monday though for obvious reasons. Why do you ask ? __label__2 Maybe there is a cellar to the mill, which would count towards the five. Can you get a photo or two and add to Commons ? __label__2 Yeah, I thought the anime was first. Would it still make sense to include <url>?__label__2 It ' s probably not notable, but it was already <url> once. Perhaps a selective merge to <url> might be an idea ? __label__2 Do you just want to decrease the width of the image and that those 5px aren ' t visible anymore? Or do you want it to make it 5pixels less wide and resize to the new image size ? __label__2 LOL, I love that movie. So, are you having Chinese food for New Year ' s Eve ? __label__2 I ' m sorry, what distinction are you making between the large sample formula and the small sample formula? Are you calculating the variances using a population formula in large samples rather than using a sample estimate of the population variance ? __label__2 @Kerrek SB : What do you think about when talking about a formatted output ? stringWithFormat does not do the job ?__label__2 No I don ' t mean for that article, I mean in general. Because when I pass nominations, the code on the GAN page doesn ' t work for me, do you have to ill some of the code in ? __label__2 Well, probably yes. But these are guys who shave their legs -- is fertility the top thing on their mind? ;)__label__2 Can you show where is it that you get stuck?

Your thoughs ? __label__2 I get the regular edit page with the instructions and everything when I click on it. Did you replace SOCKMASTER with the actual name of the sockmaster (the account controlling all the sock puppets) in the box ? __label__2 The items in question would have their notability already asserted in their own Wikipedia pages - or is this not a correct assumption? How can we resolve this, and how can we adapt our future preparation of, and reviewing of GAC, if in fact it is necessary ? __label__2 I don ' t see how this is anything but a subjective question. What ' s the benefit to having this question here ? __label__2 More question. if I need to write "myBackgroundColor = [myBackgroundColor initWithRed:.87 green:.77 blue:.56 alpha:.99]" why would "[myUIView initWithFrame : myCGRect];" work well ? __label__2 How do you want to handle friends?

So given the energy spectrum of Aluminum one can calculate the effective mass for any excitation of momentum $k$ in its brillouin zone ? __label__2 Hi, I see from your post at the reference desk, which I saw from your post at <url>, about times for locating wreckage (by the way, I posted a list of biggies I could find record of that have never been found) that you have read the above article. I have recently started converting some stuff ther that was still in present tense to past tense, in preparation for a push towards the article becomming our first air disaster FA (not counting ''<url>'', of course) and was wondering: as someone who knew nothing about the crash before, and has just read the article, do you think it ' s possible ? __label__2 How many items do you expect on each user ' s lists? How many items total are there, if there ' s a limit at all ? __label__2 Interesting. why the sugar ? __label__2 Sorry, what does "set your exposure such that that is 'properly exposed'" mean?

Are you aware that you are currently listed at <url> as inactive ? __label__2 That ' s that we have a policy against picture gallery links. But could you tell me where that is ? __label__2 It is probably because you did not give it the correct copyright tag. Could you perhaps link to the image (remember to put : before "Image" when you link it)?__label__2 Yes, I can vouch for <url> since she taught me when I was doing my undergrad! :) Have all these been restored ? __label__2 Can you provide any details about the app you are debugging? web app, wpf, winform, c++?__label__2 What does the java process do when you use kill -INT? Does it terminate, or keep running ? __label__2 So, a couple of thoughts then - a) instead of saying "XYZ is an SSI", I could say "XYZ is a <url>" and b) instead of just saying "it has been notified as an SSI" I could say something like "because of its <url>, it has been notified as an SSI". If I did those two things would that solve the problem, or do you think I need to do more than that ? __label__2 Months? Are you insane ? __label__2 cool, thanks for the input. Is the ts - 2 more efficient because you don ' t have to flip the wheel ? __label__2 What happens when you set a breakpoint in the code for the assembly?

Isn ' t it necessary to discuss first such radical changes ? __label__2 It should automatically pick them up. Is it not ? __label__2 So these are facts, and they are true. Is there some sort of guideline for using direct personal evidence ? __label__2 And what does "outside" mean? Manually from the shell, via cron - job, etc ? __label__2 This sounds like it belongs on another stack exchange, I ' m just not sure which one. Something to do with computer - architecture and hardware..maybe [Electrical Engineering](http://electronics . stackexchange . com / faq)?__label__2 @Butts Fredkin: I ' m sure you can back this claim up with some facts. Can you please provide specific quotes or a links that illustrate what you ' re talking about ? __label__2 I haven ' t seen the spec, but if your example is correct it appears they ' ve defined "25% tint" as a strict multiplication of the values. In fact that makes a certain amount of sense - how else would you define it ? __label__2 @Cyclops: I think you can edit it to be community wiki and then downvotes won ' t have an effect.

What Operating System is the server ? __label__2 How are you going to decide the right answer? Who will earn +50 reputations ? __label__2 Please define private and secure.

Are you using the built in MS unit testing or nunit ? __label__2 are you using the WPF Toolkit? what version are you using ? __label__2 The body of the question is fine, but the title is a bit confusing.

Records" the song was sent to mainstream radio as the official third single in may." OR something ? __label__2 Can someone include `getpid()` in the picture? `getpid()` in child returns 0 ? __label__2 This question might have different solutions depending on your Country. Could you please specify it ? __label__2 Wow, today I learned something completely awesome. For completeness, can you please include a link to a dictionary or at least its pronunciation ? __label__2 That ' s great. How am I supposed to execute this project which requires multiple video clips playing on the screen ? __label__2 It looks like it was carved out of both Ochamchira and Gali but I ' m not sure whether that ' s actually the case. Do you ? __label__2 The exit is superfluous, it ' s called in drupal _ goto. Have you double checked the output of content _ profile _ load (with dpm for example) and multistep _ registration _ is _ complete to make sure that they are returning what you expect to see ? __label__2 I ' d like not to receive any notices from this bot on my talk page. Is there a way to do this ? __label__2 @probabilityislogic Sorry I don ' t follow. What do you mean "get the probability that X = x"?__label__2 @Dan, I hear what your saying, but I ' m not sure what type of hash table you are describing. Is this a chained hash table where items hash to an array whose elements are linked lists of elements that hash to that array location ? __label__2 DOM elements don ' t have names per - se (although some tags such as `input` can have an attribute `name`). Could you elaborate on your requirements ? __label__2 As I don ' t want t give default values because when ever I change its height and width I also have to change it in code - which one can change? the image view or the images stored ? __label__2 You query is somehow confusing: the title asks for tables with a given width, but the description of the problem mentions column width. Can you please describe clearly and in more detail your intent ? __label__2 The expression you ' ve written, $M _ m/\sqrt{ <\psi|M _ m^+ M _ m|\psi> }$, is not a state at all. I guess you meant to add a $|\psi>$ after that ? __label__2 I need to be able to cite an online source using biblatex - mla. Did the author ever give an answer ? __label__2 CG, seems <url> is under attack as having an insufficiently global focus. Can you add anything there about Australian variants ? __label__2 Is there a performance requirement ? Should it be a fast method ?__label__2 how do i propose to change the name of <url> to <url> ??__label__2 However, I will admit that there are enough hits on Google about "Fraudulent hoax" that we could possibly make an article out of it. Is that ok with you ? __label__2 There have been several frustum / aabb culling code questions recently; would some expert make a definitive how (not why) guide that shows the steps e . g. how/ *when* to make the frustum, what transform to use on the things to test etc ? __label__2 There ' s almost certainly a better question to be asked lurking under this one. Why do you want to change the Xorg video driver? :)__label__2 Hey, out of curiosity, why is your name "TruthbringerToronto" if you ' re in Montreal? Former Torontonian that escaped perhaps ? __label__2 Can you show your appenders? Are you using the `ConsoleAppender`?__label__2 I do understand that without OS support I won ' t be able to generate cryptographically secure random sequences. But how does the second algorithm I ' ve shown compare to the first one, and (why) is one of them better than the other ? __label__2 Thanks for pointing that out. Do you suppose we should move or copy these image requests to the MilHist task forces too ? __label__2 I haven ' t tagged / assessed anything in quite some time. Which article are you referring to ? __label__2 I assume you mean `Tk::TextUndo`. Do you want the mouse cursor (x , y screen coordinates) or the current position of the text cursor (column, line)?__label__2 I agree, this is pretty much a subset of the earlier question. What ' s in this question that ' s not just a more focused subset of the earlier question ? __label__2 FYI, it appears a "campaign" has begun where people are signing up to Wikipedia for the purpose of saying "Keep" on the James Girvin AfD page (<url>). This is the first time I ' m seeing such a movement, if you wish to call it that.. :) Have you seen something like this in the past ? __label__2 I tried it on <url> and it didn ' t work for me. Can you give me one example page ? __label__2 The policy is tricky - I guess it comes down to whether or not you think the account is going to be disruptive, and whether it is appropriate to guess that ahead of time. On the other hand, looks like another overreaction to Kurt, in my opinion - what do you think ? __label__2 Ok, you are now an admin on the Wiktionary and Wikiquote, but I can not make you a sysop on a wiki that doesn ' t exist, so you ' re not one at Wikibooks yet. Are you sure it is sensible to create three new projects at once in this language ? __label__2 I ' ve reformatted the question. Can you check if my edits are okay ? __label__2 Among the measures you described, it sounds as if the next thing to try is option - command - start and rebuild the desktop. Does rebuilding the desktop mean I ' d get a blank and have to restore all the icons ? __label__2 Hey, I noticed you protected the article <url> from being recreated. Will you be able to reverse that If I recreate the article with sourced, factual, real world content ? __label__2 I ' m intending on creating a list of Crash Bandicoot locations. Do have any advice for me ? __label__2 Why is this tagget [foss4g]? what is it ? __label__2 Bounty passed, I would have doubled it even, but now as you answer your own question and you already have plenty of points and I only can offer one bounty at a time I might consider to put my next bounty on another question. Okay with that ? __label__2 You ' re very welcome. What no stones thrown my way for referring to Bishzilla, as a damsel in distress ? __label__2 Do you actually have a system with `sys / ioctl . ph` properly installed on it? Which one ? __label__2 Have you tried writing some output to the console to see how far the method gets or where the blocking begins? Is the lock to `syncLock` possible or not ? __label__2 I don ' t think it ' s just that "if I was" *can* be valid for the past -- "If I were wrong, please forgive me" sounds totally ungrammatical to me. (Am I alone in this..?)__label__2 No worries - the only thing I see holding up promotion is whether the ejectionsite website qualifies as a <url> or not. Can you tell me if the author ' s work has been cited elsewhere (like in books) or he is considered to be an expert in the field ? __label__2 What are "the proper elements"? Are you given *two* matrices, one the "source" matrix and one a "target" matrix and you must decide in which order to "encounter" the elements so as to get the "target" matrix ? __label__2 All I ' m trying to say is that calling someone you ' re in a content dispute with a vandal isn ' t right. Let me ask you this, how do we stop the warring and conflict between users on Wikipedia that have real disputes outside Wikipedia ? __label__2 Please clarify your question. What does "This results in windows 7 with the following icons" mean ? __label__2 PS I also am wondering about the letter "ll". It seems, like the Welsh <url>, to have a particular (and tricky) pronunciation, but thereu2019s nothing on the <url> or <url> pages about it: Can you shed any light on this ? __label__2 Really? Could you please tell us how to compute the maximum of $n$ $n$-bit numbers in AC$^0$?__label__2  " without cycles".. "i need to find out the minimum numbers of cycles"? You mean chains, right ? __label__2 TM should delete old backups itself. What does consol . app show for processes named backupd ? __label__2 So does jail breaking an iphone consist of changing file system and directory permissions or is it more complex? If so, does anyone know the low level technical details ? __label__2 At the request of <url>, here <url>, I ' ve created a set of quality and importance Categories for Rail transport in Germany, here: <url> and <url> and I ' ve set up the links in Wikipedia 1 . 0 assessments. Could you tweak <url> so that it copies the WPTrains "class" parameter across into Rail transport in Germany and to allow the assignment of "importance" for Rail transport in Germany ? __label__2 I tried to capture the set of restrictions you wanted in the question. Did I get it right ? __label__2 I have my finger on the block button here <url> but thought I should run it by someone else who is familiar with the situation. What do you think ? __label__2 Hi, I ' m still stuck on this question. Is there some other place I can look into to help in this ? __label__2 What is a "step"? A comparison, a swap, something else ? __label__2 Please look at me edit. If i ' m right and it does have something to do with being logged in can someone please explain to me WHY WHY WHY would that matter??__label__2 What is the priority - tracing the boundary or filling the shape? I mean, is it okay if the rectangles trace the boundary perfectly but leave a hole in the middle somewhere ? __label__2 I can ' t tell if you ' re asking how a programmer can "break in" to the industry (convincing game companies they ' ve got what it takes even if their experience is in financial software or something), or how a game programmer can get a non - game programming job (convincing other people that game programmers don ' t just play games all day but they actually have real programming skills). Which is it ? __label__2 Are example . com, c . example . com and i . example . com on the same webserver so that these rules also apply to the latter ones? And have you tried a 301 redirect instead an implicit 302 redirect ? __label__2 How did you install it? Did you use the the Ubuntu packages ? __label__2 I have been watching the vote page, but I did not even see your proposal. What were you suggesting ? __label__2 What device do you have? Does it have a custom UI like Sense or TouchWiz ? __label__2 reduced it onto sat, though number of clauses is much too high for a sat - solver. any ideas on how to divide and conquer this ? __label__2 I don ' t profess to be an expert on the <url>, but note that the Gaelic Wikipedia has ''xc0rcaibh'', redirected from ''Arcaibh''. Are you certain it should be a short vowel ? __label__2 Could you be a bit clearer ? How is your line represented ?__label__2 Early on (9 . 3 timeframe), we were advised by ESRI to not use the geometry datatype for feature classes that participated in topologies or networks (we were experiencing some severe performance issues). Maybe someone can comment as to whether this is still an issue ? __label__2 I think <url> will require checkuser intervention. How do I relist it ? __label__2 I ' m not entirely sure what the question here is. Are you asking about specific forms of matrices, or the general case (in which case a simple counting argument seems to work)?__label__2 Something ' s wrong with <url>. Or is it just me ? __label__2 Okay, I think I finally might "get it" well enough to leave this side discussion and take it back to the QD talk page. Meet me there ? __label__2 @Sukumar What do you mean by "size of my page"? Could you please give me an example of "passing the values directly to javacsript"?__label__2 I noticed you reverted a deletion on FC Bayern ' s wikipedia page. Do we know if Stephan Fxfcrstner has been loaned out to any club like Christian Lell went to FFC Koeln or like Mats Hummels did to Burussia Dortmund ? __label__2 I have it ready now. Would there be any policy violations if I upload the image over the protected one ? __label__2 are BetaH, BetaM, BetaL also parameters (i . e. things to estimate)?__label__2 Give us some requirements? How much data will you be sending and is the data only across a local computer, or is it across a network ? __label__2 What is `a`? Is there a value or just 0 ? __label__2 Thank you for your comments. May I refer you to <url>, where I think you will find the sort of criticism section that you are looking for ? __label__2 Since the _\citation{}_ and _\bibcite{}_ commands are in the .aux files, it should be quite easy to extract the relevant entries from a BibTeX database. Has no - one written such a tool ? __label__2 All I did was add a newline and 3 spaces to change the formatting. Perhaps someone else tried to edit at the same time as me ? __label__2 Nice, but it overlaps notifications. Could you move them under the sticky bar ? __label__2 Sorry, another issue has taken my attention, and I don ' t think I can get to this task. Since you are running AWB, and have thought through how to do the regexes, is there a reason you can ' t make the heading change yourself ? __label__2 If you have experience of calculating initial centers by taking random samples, please do let me know how big sample is good enough for this purpose? and also if there is any special technique to take the random sample ? __label__2 i tried to get the angles and add 90 to the angles of the axis i want to rotate about ,but i don ' t know if this i true, can anyone give me a general algorithm??__label__2 Do you mean that you can ' t scroll all the way to the last `treeview node`? Are you adding items dynamically ? __label__2 The old article was deleted. Have you had a chance to read the discussion and rationale for this decision ? __label__2 what i mean is the php part is the part that you need to debug. what is the error that you are getting ? __label__2 What actually happens? Have you tried placing a breakpoint on Response . Redirect ? __label__2 I have stamped out numerous non - GB spellings in <url> per <url>. Did I miss any ? __label__2 I looked at the quotations and they seemed aligned to me. Is there something that I ' m missing ? __label__2 What is "this tab bar"? Can you provide a code sample or screenshot ? __label__2 When I run the code I am able to select store and that validation is good, however when I enter in a purchase amount I get invalid message and am still able to enter in the negative values. Not sure if there is an issue with my while statement ? __label__2 Are you trying to load the image into an ImageView? Can you post the contents of the JSON response ? __label__2 Sorry, why are you forced to use this thing? Do you have any personal will - power ? __label__2 Bull - please try to edit your question with any answers to comments. If using Firefox - have you tried the Add - on "Flash - aid" that usually resolves flash problems ? __label__2 That picture of Patricia Hewitt, looks copyrighted to me, it is from here..what do you think all these are commons? <url> is is unclear but they have this terms of use statement statement <url> perhaps it is worth asking a picture expert, what do you think ? __label__2 A perfect hash is only possible in this case if you don ' t want to hash any arbitrary combination of 17 digits, but only a limited list of keys all known in advance. Is that what you have ? __label__2 Great. Do you want me to relink something ? __label__2 Is there a correct term for them? (Variations / Sub - Lists ?)__label__2 By the way. Can you edit your own talk page when it is protected ? __label__2 Oh, Thanks. So I just need to put what articles I am going to be working on, and the coordinators will put my points on the scoreboard ? __label__2 Incredible. Did you use any third party frameworks for the UI element that you can share ? __label__2 In an article like <url>, I think it would be better if you based the content on secondary sources rather than articles that you have found in the ''BMJ''s online archive. Could I persuade you to discuss your additions on <url>?__label__2 just a question, why do you keep a list of the digits as booleans ? -have you thought of int _ of _ string with the right prefix ?- i mean do you need this intermediate data type ?__label__2 Although I have no detailed knowledge of the matter, it ' s my understanding that the BIOS source code appeared in the "purple book" that IBM provided to other companies under NDA. Did IBM publish it more openly than that ? __label__2 So, what does your ActionListener - Method? Does it simply call `updateTable()`, but does nothing with the result ? __label__2 Since the Dictionary of String and Dictionary is named MasterDB, does that mean it is an in - memory database? If so, why do you have to load the entire DB into memory ? __label__2 I don ' t think this is a duplicate, mghie - JVNR seems to want to check if it ran as well, which I don ' t think that other SO question really addresses - and it ' s certainly not in the accepted answer. Also, JVNR, I think you could edit the question title to be a bit clearer or help other people find the question - maybe mention "running" a Perl script, not "automate", and something about checking if it ran or not ? __label__2 @davka From what I can see from your examples, `\"` and `\\"` are already handled correctly. How do you want them handled differently ? __label__2 if you need to debug a batch file potentially you are using the wrong tool for the task. Why not try cscript . exe ? __label__2 Are you ' re sure your Device / Emulator has a working Internet - connection? Did you declare the Internet - privilege in the Android Manifest ? __label__2 Squeegy, I didn ' t set any breakpoints, so I guess TouchXML had breakpoints included? How do I get rid of them ? __label__2 What do you want to do with the data? Use it internally, or redistribute it ? __label__2 If I were to make that map I probably would chose to have two colours, one for states using JCP as a disciplinary measure and one for states which do not. What do you think ? __label__2 Looking through the dicussions on the DRM Talk page, I ' m failing to find the point where consensus was reached. Would you mind pointing it out to me ? __label__2 Another MySQL database, or another database type? Do you still want access to the regular WordPress database, or are you moving the site from one DB to another ? __label__2 These edits appear to be related to the same issue that caused the page to be protected. Could you please explain why you are doing this ? __label__2 Then why is the article for the monastery in Lhasa as "Ganden" instead of "Gandan"? Do both the monasteries have the same name ? __label__2 Try to run the same command from the shell and see what error you get. It can take hours to convert a video, maybe you should just wait ? __label__2 Where is labelHashTable declared? Is it a file - scope (global) variable ? __label__2 It ' s a shame that <url> still needs repair. What do you think ? __label__2 Hi there. Regarding the comment you added <url>, how can this be verified ? __label__2 I got rid of the non - notable entries. What else needs to be done ? __label__2 This IP address <url> has taken it upon himself to start removing stuff with fact tags on it. Is that appropriate ? __label__2 What does the `to _ be _ null _ safe` method do? Does it return an instance of a subclass of `Array`?__label__2 I agree, more info needed. Is it PHP, .NET, straight HTML, or something else ? __label__2 What happens if you `print somefile . readline()` -- do you get the cruft? How about if you open the files in Notepad ? __label__2 I ' m surprised no - one ' s mentioned calzone (unless it ' s lurking under an alias). Am I the only one who eats this when I ' m in the States ? __label__2 Drive - by comment: Mikka ' s behaviour reminds me of Stevertigo ' s on <url>.. perhaps an RfC is in order? Nothing harsh, just an opportunity to clarify some policy points on protection and blocking ? __label__2 Would you please make the question more clear? Do you want `\BRallowhypbch` activated when you set `\emergencystretch`?__label__2 Well, I do have one question. If I were to come across a page that I would normally mark as a CSD- like copyright infringement, etc, as an admin can I just delete it or do I need to mark it CSD and ask another opinion ? __label__2 what context would the serial number be used in? Is it just an identifier or is it meant to be a secure type thing (like the Windows registration key)?__label__2 are they in the same namespace ? Usually, different assemblies use different namespaces ? __label__2 What have you done? At least written the code for tree ? __label__2 What is n? The number of edges or vertices ? __label__2 Python says: `NameError: global name 'a' is not defined`. Did you mean `ip _ header _ sum = ~ip _ header _ sum & 0xFF` ?__label__2 - This IP has been doing the same to me. There seems to be a remarkable similarity with <url>, could this be a case of sockpuppeting ? __label__2 If it can wait until tomorrow, I ' ll look then. Could you provide diffs to the two threads ? __label__2 Windows has some of this functionality built in, [net send ..](http://ww . microsoft . com / resources / documentation / windows / xp / all / proddocs / en - us / net _ send . mspx ? mfr=true). Is windows - specific good enough ? __label__2 I always try to use correct grammar. Why dumb down your correspondence ? __label__2 Can you provide an example of how `$tree` is structured? Also, what version of PHP ? __label__2 What links did you want to add in? How do they differ from the ones currently in place ? __label__2 It ' s in the library I think. Need a specific reference ? __label__2 it is proven that there is no close formula for n>=5. do you mean you are looking for a numerical approximation ? __label__2 It depends on how you wanted to modify that query. What exactly were you trying to accomplish ? __label__2 What should we write, then? Do we make note of the split - up around 1917 and omit the mention of 1931, or do we make note of the split - up around 1917 and mention that the marriage (may have) lasted until 1931 ? __label__2  " Won ' t load"? Can you better describe the error ? __label__2 Hello, I ' m just wondering how you have found out all the birthdates for the Coronation Street characters? Does it say somewhere ? __label__2 Sorry for the edit. Out of curiosity, why did you change it back ? __label__2 You can find more ideas and code in "Separating Two Populations in a Sample," http://stats . stackexchange . com / questions / 899 / separating - two - populations - from - the - sample. (Is there perhaps some better way of cross - referencing threads than I ' ve done here?)__label__2 The article doesn ' t seem to imply that ''The Game Keeper'' was created by WotC, nor does it give a hint when the company bought the stores. Were you thinking of something specific I can change to make that more clear, or is it fine as - is ? __label__2 Oh I know, but I think that ' s a ''problem''. Unless there is some other cat for modem companies ? __label__2 What does the code look like where you do pushViewController:? What does it look like where you do popViewController: (or whatever variant thereof)?__label__2 Your question only mentions intellisense. Do you get actual *compile errors* too ? __label__2 But in this case, at least there is an actual author making the claim, which is generally where I draw the line. Is Wood an inappropriate or fringe source, and if so, what makes her so ? __label__2 It sounds like this is just a simple round - robin tournament which isn ' t too hard to code; however, what sort of scoring rules should be used? Is the winner the one with the most wins, or are you using a point system where strength of play comes into account ? __label__2 @Omega Centauri - I think that strictly speaking, levelized costs are normally for *energy* rather than *power*. Anyway, can someone with the rep please move to close this question, as it ' s speculative ? __label__2 Are you after a DLNA client or server for your phone? In other words do you have content on your phone that you want to play on a TV (or PC) or do you have content on a PC that you want to play on your phone ? __label__2 Can you see all the edits I have done? Is there a chat feature here to speed up communication, I would like to ask you a few quick questions if I may, please ? __label__2 hello. I do not know if others, but to me your question is not all clear (sorry). do you want show messages from a module of Drupal using javascript ? __label__2 You don ' t alter the code of Views to add a new sort criteria: you create a module that implements the new criteria. Are you sure there isn ' t already a similar sort criteria ? __label__2 There ' s usually an indicator the furnace is "on" (I would guess the flames icon to the right of the temperature in your picture). Does that turn off as well when the LCD dims ? __label__2 I noticed that you created the Close AFD script. Is it possible to edit it so that it works on all xFDs ? __label__2 In the project settings under the web tab is it correctly set to use local IIS web server? Also did you build immediately before attempting to attach ? __label__2 Sorry but that is currently covered by NDA. Would my previous projects be satisfactory ? __label__2 Hey, I just noticed <url>, and something doesn ' t seem right. What should be done ? __label__2 I did a little copy editing, added commas and such. Are you bringing it to DYK ? __label__2 while that link is related things aren ' t quite the same in c++. For one thing isn ' t reference counting a lot more popular ? __label__2 The question is not really clear, sorry. I understand that English is not you native language, could you perhaps get someone else to read it for you can clarify the wording ? __label__2 Can you explain what you mean by "base"? Do you mean the crust ? __label__2 Unfortunately the 4chan page you linked to in <url> does not exist now. Can you give a pointer to what is involved ? __label__2 when it comes to unit testing I want to be able to renew the singleton object before every test. This is one of the arguments against singletons. Does this object really need to be a singleton in the first place ? __label__2 Unless you have only a few big groups, enumerating all of them will likely take way too long. Could you add more details ? __label__2 If you know the line it crashes on, could you post that line of code? Do you have threads in your program ? __label__2 How big are the sets? Can you read all of them once from the disk and then keep them in memory ? __label__2 I like the larger size of the picture. He ' s a forceful speaker; why not convey this in a photo ? __label__2 It strikes me that in your debug output, you ' ve carefully converted things to strings, but you haven ' t done the same to XX. What happens when you change XX to XX . to _ s ? __label__2 Where did you find the `dequeue` method? [My API doesn ' t show it](http://download . oracle . com / javase / 6 / docs / api / java / util / PriorityQueue . html) ..?__label__2 It is not possible to update primary key columns in a relational database. Maybe you can use a surrogate key ? __label__2 The editor that made this <url> is arguing that another article includes more than 10 reviews, therefore this one can. What is the name of policy / guideline about not referring to other articles, so that I can refer to it in explaining to him why his argument is wrong ? __label__2 this question is getting flags. Can you improve it or make it more clearly a *question* please ? __label__2 And how do you want the words to be sent? Each word separately, or the text as a whole ? __label__2 Commons <url> has been at Deletion Requests since July. Can it be closed now ? __label__2 Try to phrase the question in language - neutral terms: how would you go about implementing a function that received a X and did Y to it? What is the merit of the FlyWeight pattern and could you sketch an implementation in C ? __label__2 Is it really? Windows aside, I ' d like to see some comparison of security of the default OS X install vs default installs of various Linux distros - do you know of something like that ? __label__2 Yes, I do, but Norris is generally better. What points / issues do you think it should also cover ? __label__2 You may want to look at the changelog for ActiveRecord (http://ar . rubyonrails . org / files / CHANGELOG . html) and see if anything listed there might apply to your situation. Also, what Ruby version are you running ? __label__2 @Eric - Sure, it mitigates it to an extent, but why start with something insecure when it ' s just as easy to use something more secure (i . e. same code, just swap out algorithm name)?__label__2 If I am allowed to squeak in, maybe there should be some discussion at <url> where the editors would express their opinions on the matter, with the dates staying for the time as they were before this started, that is, BC / AD. No ? __label__2 actually.. what are we trying to do with the disks? According to this discussion: http://cboard . cprogramming . com / cplusplus - programming / 127768 - towers - hanoi - variation . html they are probably being swapped ? __label__2 Oh, I see that you removed the redirect from District of Columbia and restored the text. That has redirected to "Washington DC" for about 4 years now, and I ' ve reverted it - if you have something ambitious in mind, please bring it up on one of the talk pages first, okay ? __label__2 @hh - Fascinating topic, but "which energy sources would you use" isn ' t answerable in its current form. Can you please ask a specific question ? __label__2 What language are you using? What have you tried so far ? __label__2 P . S. Did you see the interesting bit of Oregon politics COI today ? __label__2 I took a stab at editing the page..but really think the page should just be deleted with a redirection from <url> to either <url> or <url>. How do we make that happen ? __label__2 I mean if you can help me to restore my userpage, the orginal version is to simple and when i look at your page it is perfect. I like also the editorstar, how can i get this item on my page ? __label__2 Perhaps a nitpick, but a win - loss ratio of 60 - 40 is a little under 2 / 3 wins, not 3 / 4. Also, aren ' t the points somehow affected by the difference between the players' rankings ? __label__2 I ' m confuse here. You didn ' t understand OOP or you disagree with benefits spread by oop proponents ? __label__2 Can you clarify what it is that you ' re trying to do? What queries do you want to support ? __label__2 oh, my, how did I get this here twice; trying to do too much at once (what else is new). Can you copy instead a different color ? __label__2 In what context to you want to generate concave hulls / alpha shapes? In PostGIS, ArcMap, a web - map, your own software ? __label__2 It ' s not so clear here. You want to know how to use gcc to compile C program ? __label__2 That works better. Do you reckon it may even be worth listing the case in the introductory paragraph ? __label__2 dmckee: I ' m actually using Welford ' s Method for the standard deviation. But I don ' t see anything in that link about mode, median, kurtosis, or skewness.. Am I missing something ? __label__2 Um, I ' ll check it out, 141 . 158 . 210 . 110, but I haven ' t had a lot of edits (if any) on that article. In the mean time, why not <url> and join the Wikipedia community ? __label__2 @David: okay, if you are taking your definition this strictly then the answer is much simpler: you cannot enforce the condition $\dot{\phi} = 0$. Why would you think you can do that in *these* coordinates in the first place ? __label__2 So, your IDE is Eclipse. Have you checked that the JAR file is present at the _Project > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries_ page ? __label__2 @Shinto: Isn ' t the purpose of an English - usage Q & A site to answer questions? As opposed to telling people "Go look up the answer"?__label__2 I ' ve just noticed I wrote "It ' s possibly the most ''possible'' incident in his life" for "possibly the most ''important''", so I may be more caught in the toils of flu than I thought. Check I haven ' t done anything stupid, and smooth out the text ? __label__2 Voting to close on the grounds this is not a constructive question. A sentence could be, for example, an answer to someone asking **"What ' s the first [or n ' th] letter of the alphabet?"**__label__2 So putting them in separate declarations is fine? I mean can we actually use auto in anyway inside a struct like I showed in the example ? __label__2 The oracle $B$ is unnecessary here: since, by (3) $M \neq N$, we can take $B$ to be the empty oracle. Essentially what you ' re asking is: do we know of any complexity class *separations* (as opposed to collapses) that do not relativize ? __label__2 Last month <url> was not promoted to FA because, apparently, not enough people had taken the time to read and comment. If I nominate it again, will you read it (it ' s lengthy) and comment ? __label__2 I ' m actually a total novice, I had no clue. How are you supposed to put it in, and why is the way I ' m doing it bad ? __label__2 This suggests a driver problem in the newer kernel.

Short of totally protecting the pages, what strong - arm tactics do my colleagues have in mind ? __label__2 Thanks for pointing that out, however, several of those figures are listed with their full names in some of the sources. What to do then ? __label__2 The assembly of a try / catch block indeed shows calls to objc _ begin _ catch and objc _ end _ catch.

I assume they are wood underneath with plaster on top and 5 / 6 inch wide marble slab on top ? __label__2 What is wrong?

Do you support this ? __label__2 In addition, I wonder what Encyclopedist is up to now - he claims that he has gained adminship under another account while simutaneously vandalizing using other socks. Should we attempt to seek out his other accounts and have them blocked and / or desysopped ? __label__2 Is it in order to boot him from a wikiproject etc.?__label__2 Hi JP.

Do you normally have "visual effects" set to normal, or none ? __label__2 Just curious.. Where did it come from? Where did you cut and paste it from ? __label__2 This looks useful.

I . e., are you authorized to do something like an authenticated vulnerability scan of the system in question ? __label__2 `UITextField` and `UILabel` are not the same thing. Which do you have ? __label__2 you cannot change an email address. Are you talking about the display name ?__label__2 This shouldn ' t be happening.

So is SIFT a replacement for NCC or SAD ? __label__2 You can use it quickly cut a straight cut on a 2x4 with a circular saw. Any other uses ? __label__2 I agree that ''Pack'' need some work. Is there an appropriate way to flag it for some attention ? __label__2 Acad, I see we have one fairly ambiguous comment at <url>, dealing with hyphenation, which is one of the things we agree on, if memory serves. Any advance on 4 people who care ? __label__2 Are you using C++/CLI? Why is there a mention of a "managed" object ? __label__2 Sorry, I just don ' t see the long TeXed formula in TeX even though it looks OK in the preview - a strange bug that I am unable to fix.

Can one use the same underdot diacritic used for <url>s, <person>?__label__2 Yes it is a homework question. I ' m just trying to do it correctly, will this be a problem ? __label__2 What version? 6 or 7 ? __label__2 That makes sense! Is it OK if decking runs across that area? Air can flow through the 1 1 / 5" gap and down to under the deck, right ? __label__2 @MitchWheat Thank you for your input. Could you explain why a serious question about programming that requires some thought is noise while (presumably) questions like "please do my homework for me" or "how do I do something trivial in .net without bothering to read the docs" are not ? __label__2 The brainteaser of course is that the <url> documentation subpage currently manages to show all situations working correctly with no red links, yet the same metatemplate called from cite _ web / sandbox is having problems. Is the problem that one template can not accept a winklinked date output from a called metatemplate, or is this really just a problem of my buggy coding skills ?__label__2 Is *r* necessarily positive? Is it an integer ? __label__2 Can we assume contiguous IDs in [Employee Schedule] make a range? Or only [Day ID]?__label__2 The layout is there and also some content but due to lack of time during the recent past I was unable to bring it to the final 'publication suitable' form. Perhaps you could help me in giving the final touches ? __label__2 I thought you had done that, and started working on turning it into a disambiguation page. Could you now graft the history on to the changes I made ? __label__2 I haven ' t uploaded any more to Wiki because they tend to be more detailed and rather more abstruse. Have you had a look at Barry Burnham ' s book from Oxbow of 2004 ? __label__2 the code would be to big to post here on SO. so how would I use classes with my Jquery code ? __label__2 mm sounds good.

Are you trying to prevent or cause hitting a limit ? __label__2 Notwithstanding the caption, my understanding is that because of the time since the first publication of the photo, the copyright has expired and Iu2019m free scan the figure and upload the image to Wikipedia.

I ' ve suggested an RfC, what do you think ? __label__2 In the infobox for <url>, the "Website" link which points to "The Stratton Audley Village Web Site" redirects through http://ww . strattonaudley . com/ to the <url>.

Are you aware of a good source we could stick in the article to back this up ? __label__2 Done. Is it correct ? __label__2 To be honest (in my experience) those tags are quite likely to stay <u>forever</u> - because people actually fixing things is a very rare event..

Which tag is correct ? __label__2 There ' s a question about where you got the image of the ''Enterprise''. Maybe you could clarify ? __label__2 Is `MPSection *section = [self . sections objectAtIndex : indexPath . row];` correct? or did you mean `MPSection *section = [self . sections objectAtIndex : indexPath . section]`;?__label__2 Your question seems quite strange, given that if you want to find all the paths and their costs, you can just enumerate them and sum the edges costs to get the total cost. Maybe you want the shortest path ? __label__2 That ' s what figured. Thanks for the clarification. So how do you adapt for the missing arc in the measurement ? __label__2 BQP - complete? Can someone cite a BQP - complete problem please ? __label__2 2147483647.

Could you check whether there is an non - CSD - able version in the page history, and if so, restore it ? __label__2 Check your references, do you have a reference to the output of the project, ie. a "reference to itself"?__label__2 Yeah i have tried the guides but cant seem to find any way to load multiple .xib files.

What was I doing wrong in the Italian films ? __label__2 You probably want to use your package manager, which depends on your distro. Which are you using ? __label__2 Will expressions always be unambiguously parenthesized like that, so you don ' t have to deal with precedence? Or is `X OR Y AND Z` allowed ? __label__2 What if I want to have another while loop within the main and split the record even further? I ' ve noticed that then the first loop doesn ' t loop beyond just the first iteration, why ? __label__2 As far as I can tell, the personal attacks against editors has indeed subsided. Are you indicating you are aware of recent incidents ? __label__2 @ennuikiller - really? What mode is it opened in ? __label__2 You will need some code on the server side for this to work. What environment are you going to host this in / what scripting languages might be available on the server side ? __label__2 You ' ve not said anything recently; Are you still editing?

Perl works well if the version as Mac OS X is used ? __label__2 Thanks for doing the DYK update - I saw it was overdue, but had no time to do the notifications (though I would have had time just to copy to the main template and purge the cache). Has there ever been discussion of having a bot do the notices (perhaps with the name of the admin who did the Update given, in case there were questions)?__label__2 Hey US, I added a rationale to why the project was looking to create its own criteria. Could you take a look at it and see if it changes your mind ? __label__2 Have you as yet cast your own vote for <url>? Is there anything you can do to address some of the questions ? __label__2 It just has one too many anime cats, like ''Sailor Moon''. Could you also take a shot at it ? __label__2 Is that on Windows?

Possibly worth mentioning in the Signpost ? __label__2 This is how Hotmail has been programmed to work. Why is using a folder other than `Deleted` not an option for you ? __label__2 I ' ve been looking at some of the moves you have made, as above, which you justify by reference to <url>. Could you point out where in <url> this recommendation is made ? __label__2 depends, there has to be a fraction of a triangle at the top, since it wont line up with the top of the screen. How do you handle that ? __label__2 I ' m not sure I understand your question? What ' s the issue you ' re having??__label__2 I think I may have found a solution on the Immaculate Conception article.

Mine keeps on coming back when there is no message ? __label__2 Looks like `CodeMirror . fromTextArea('code', options);` returns `undefined`. Maybe you are passing the wrong arguments to that function ? __label__2 According to <url>, links are permissible as part of your signature but be sure to check the "''Sign my name exactly as shown''" box. What happens when you load ''<nowiki><url><url> (<url>)</nowiki>'' into the signature window and check the box ? __label__2 I looked at all the provinces and regencies listed on <url> - so that trick is mostly played out.

I . e. is { 3, -3 } a pair, or is { 3, 3 } a pair ? __label__2 I ' m also curious how do you heat it up without it becoming softer.

Can this be fixed ? __label__2  " Does anyone here know of an SEO company or individual that has had good results .." - This question is inviting highly subjective responses (and spam). Suggested rephrasing: "How can I find a professional SEO provider with experience getting first - page results?"__label__2 Yeah, but that suggests that pounds alone aren ' t included.

Base64 ? __label__2 Re your vote on motion 1, I don ' t currently have a mafia, to the best of my knowledge & mdash ; but maybe it ' s not a bad idea. Shall I post a sign - up sheet ? __label__2 Hi, I saw you protected <url> (<url>, <url>, <url>). In light of their signing to <url>, their <url>, <url>, and <url> <url> <url>, would you mind unprotecting it so I can give it a better treatment ? __label__2 But the LoadWith - to my understanding should eliminate the lazy - load problem of serialization. What ' s more weird is that it ' s actually returned by a WCF service so It should already be serialized -right ? __label__2 It will show whichever class library you had selected as "Set as Startup Project", won ' t it? Did you mean "How can I select which *usercontrol* the testcontainer will show"?__label__2 Because I haven ' t seen it; I ' m not even sure from the discussion whether it ' s on or off Wikipedia. Can you supply a link or a reference ? __label__2 You mentioned OWASP, but not their [Web Application Firewall](http://ww . owasp . org / index . php / Web _ Application _ Firewall). Is there anything you ' d like to do that isn ' t handled by the WAFs listed on that page ? __label__2 The general dominating set problem is equivalent (even in the approximate version) to set - cover, for which the greedy algorithm is optimal.

Are you looking for a list of ways to implement a scene graph ? __label__2 Please mark homework as such. Have you tried talking to your professor yet ? __label__2 Why couldn ' t you do a (concrete, stone) patio, with one step down from the door (assuming the door is high enough to need a step). Is there a reason this has to be a deck ? __label__2 just a simple question: if you created a simple `Foo` object, how will you be able to cast it to `Foo<T>`? From where should it have the additional `Data`?__label__2 That it prints all `indent1` s for the first `tableheader` node is obvious as all following `indent1` s are siblings of this node. Can you please provide the exact output ? __label__2 @Kiril yes you can, using function pointers. But even then, how ' s that different from passing the struct around to functions ? __label__2 what have you tried? What did you find when you searched ? __label__2 the problem I have is with founding out what the base case and the inductive step are. the base case is n = 3, with the array being: operand operand operator, how do I prove that the program above evaluates it correctly ? __label__2 How about "Hi y ' all!" or "Howdy folks!"? ;)__label__2 I wouldn ' t know where to put it. I know Record Charts is for charts etc and the certifications but where would I put a discography question ? __label__2 Wow does that mean we can cut <url> into a small stub :) ??__label__2 Regarding <url>: you closed it as no consensus, and I admit its close, but there are four well thought out deletes and only three keeps don ' t (in my view) present any clear arguments. Do you mind taking another look ? __label__2 What are you constructing a path for? XmlHttpRequest ? __label__2 I ' m not sure I understood the question, are you asking how to prevent users from flooding the database with invalid (i . e. junk) requests ? __label__2 My latest film is<url>. DO you rhink if it is referenced it is good enough ? __label__2 Yea, all of the coordinates are unique and in the correct order. So I am right in assuming this is not supposed to be happening ? __label__2 It ' s good that you stated your reasoning, but it would be even better if you could isolate the difficult ideas and ask a conceptual question rather than restating your homework. For example, "What forces act on a ball that rolls without slipping, and what are their relative magnitudes ? __label__2 How large is the file, would it fit into memory. How do you separate the emails within the file ? __label__2 Perhaps you could elaborate a little bit more on your built order. Are you gathering enough resources, what else are you doing, are you scouting to see what the others are doing ? __label__2 have you tried this? What output do you get ? __label__2 I think this area of discussion is important. Especially if we flip it around and ask "what should I as a photographer be [not] doing to make my clients happy", or "what should my clients be looking for in me"?__label__2 Also, can you please elaborate what you mean with "whenever I install some opengl related packages". Like which one ? __label__2 In this case, posting the code that causes the error, and just the exception _without_ the full trace would probably be more helpful. The error message says that you ' re passing a `nil` argument to `-[NSURL initFileURLWithPath:]`; have you looked into that ? __label__3 I have a question about your question. Did clean urls configure correctly ? __label__3 Mainly about Diane and Janine. Even if it ' s for an episode or two, Don ' t we usually re - add their names to the cast based on their existing history with the show ? __label__3 The question asks how effective fluorescent clothes are during the day, and should he stop buying those tops for his daily commute. Please can you answer this a bit more specifically, rather than focusing on night time visibility ? __label__3  ( ec ) Yes, I just saw that in "my" contribs". And apparently only arbcom members can close them.. Best course of action ? __label__3 Wow, this really is a broad question! Can you mention what you already tried ? __label__3 What ' s the platform? Linux ? __label__3 Define the quality of traffic. What makes traffic "quality"?__label__3 See <url>: ''Also, Spirit Airlines has received approval to begin service to Chiclayo, Perxfa, but has not set a start date yet.'' If they have reveived the approval yet, isn ' t it quite sure then the service will really start in the future ? __label__3 I dunno, that ' s what the vandals seem to think. And who are we to doub them, being the considerate, mature, thoughtful people they so often are ? __label__3 I would have explained a problem which could have solved with the help of Versioning and then would have explained what versioning is all about. you did the same and yet they do not understand ? __label__3 I ' m excited! My latest Kies download is under progress now.. Please tell me, is 2 . 2 official upgrade released ? __label__3 You could always repartition and then restore /home from backup. You do have backups, don ' t you ? __label__3 What ' s :data ( data) supposed to do? Did you mean :data ( rhs . data)?__label__3 I see. What about "Main Church"?__label__3 I thought we had all agreed that the lead is fine as it is. What is the sentence supposed to mean ? __label__3 what do you think? speedy or wiktionary ? __label__3 Looks ok at first blush. I assume that <controller> and <action> are placeholders and you are really posting the proper values.. Are you then actually following up with 103 bytes of data ? __label__3 Did you see the final messages on that now banned user 100% Christians page? They really show he is 100 percent Christian dont they ? __label__3 Are you deactivating the same plugin multiple times? Or does that message comes on every plugin deactivation of multiple plugins ? __label__3 I hate categorizing and I ' m guessing you know which would be most appropriate for <url> article. Would you mind ? __label__3 Could you be more precise about what you mean by cross - tabulating the ORs? Your factors have more than two levels ? __label__3 Is your name like A <url>? Is the 'A' a negation as to imply that you are not squid ? __label__3 ok. it ' s not something I can get terribly excited about, to be honest. Perhaps I am missing something ? __label__3 You recently reverted both these pages with the reason "not in the linked article". I ' m just curious, what does "not in the linked article" actually mean ? __label__3 OK you fixed it. I know the difference between these:<nowiki> <url>, <url></nowiki> but what are these supposed to mean <nowiki><person>, <url></nowiki>?__label__3 Again samething with the second site, again outside of taking they ' re word for it how do we know they are are right. What is your opinion on the 2 logos in the forum discussion think they were made up ? __label__3 So is `$x` not set at all earlier in a . pl? Do you know what the value of `$x` and `$ENV{$x}` are before the `system()` call ? __label__3 The thread at <url> ground to a halt. Any way to get this implemented ? __label__3 When I look at the stats on the <url> wiki page I only see 55 Major appearances from 1972 onwards. I ' m going by the assumption that page is correct ? __label__3  " When comparing to baseArr1, the answer should be compArr1 and when comparing to baseArr2, the answer should be compArr2." Based on what criteria ? __label__3 Can you specify the order of the layers if you make lasagne ? __label__3 Yes that ' s what I understand, an emerald flowsion or something like it. You say the attacker wraps his right arm, not his right leg, don ' t ? __label__3 Why do you mean by "release" and "delete" here? Does "delete" mean usage of `delete`, or erasing from the map ? __label__3 What exactly do you mean by a "build"? How does the "legacy" part change your question ? __label__3 While the title of this question *does* use "Palatable" correctly, [the word](http://ww . merriam - webster . com / dictionary / palatable) has connotations of "mm, tasty!" Perhaps edit to say "easier"?__label__3 Ok, it turns out that taking the advice from the log and using Serial, instead of Integer, :serial => true, fixes it. But my question still stands, Why did this work locally, and not on Heroku ' s server ? __label__3 Why the removal of the citation dealing with coriolis? Was the proof not within the citation, or was the citation not considered primary ? __label__3 If the set is {1 , 2 , 3} will the list be {1 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6}? In other words, can there be duplicates in the input list ? __label__3 i also need to know what are we using the stack for?? i mean the push command??__label__3 Could you post the image, or part of it along with the colours you ' re trying to apply and what actually happens to the image? (is it the whole image that changes colour or just the colour you ' re applying that ' s wrong?)__label__3 Okay - later tonight (I ' m a bit busy right now), I ' ll restore them for.. hm. Will three days be long enough for you to copy the information ? __label__3 How many recipients is "mass"? Also does it need to be a 3rd - party service ? __label__3 Please be a little specific - "best" differs amongst various users. What features specifically are you looking for ? __label__3 They all used to be dabs that linked to other dabs which are now housed in the pages I moved them to, so I don ' t think there ' s too a need to restore them. Also, I eliminated the "4th of July (song)" redirect as there was only one page linking to it; no use for a redirect if nobody is going to it, right ? __label__3 I guess it ' s kind of an obvious suggestion, but.. Have you tried kohlrabi ? __label__3 Be that as it may, and not to quibble with your block, but I did some research and I ' ve found that this puppeteer does in fact exist - the Washington Post described him as a "master", for instance, and Woodcarver Online calls him a "leading puppet artist". May I ask why you decided that the creation of the article was indicative of socklike behavior ? __label__3 two programs (processes) and two threads are completely different sets of beasts. which do you mean ? __label__3  " I + have" = proper agreement; "she + is" = agreement; "she + would" = agreement. Am I missing something ? __label__3 You <url> that you were working on an overhaul of the archiving system. Do you have any plans to start working on this again ? __label__3 I ' m not quite sure how this will work. There are hundreds of different tools used in a chef ' s kitchen. Any suggestions on how to organize it ? __label__3 did you mean `{:a => ["val1", "val2", ..], :b => ["valb1", "valb2", ..], ..}`?? so that the output will include, say, `:c => "valc1"`, blah blah blah ? __label__3 Please do not make false accusations. Where did he add a cn tag to a comment by a non - believer ? __label__3 Why do you need to create static images for the pages at all? Why not re - render the PDF page as needed at the higher zoom scale ? __label__3 What kind of reporting? What exactly are you trying to do ? __label__3 Well, OTRS is multilingual, so she could contact OTRS in Turkish and people would be able to deal with the issue there. What was the exact wording of her "release" of the images ? __label__3 No, I said that targetting images merely because of their uploader would be considered wikistalking- I explicitly said I did not want to accuse anyone of anything. Which images do you feel have been tagged incorrectly ? __label__3  " Overmans believes that the figure of 473 , 00 deaths listed in the 1965 German Church Service study is incomplete and not a definitive accounting of losses in the Expulsions" ? What is "Expulsions" here ? __label__3 Hi, Scottalter. Did you read <url> about it ? __label__3 Well, the article is sourced to his official bio site (government), whereas none of the two sources you mentioned strikes me as strong. We ' ve got <url>, why not follow the article sources and keep George Petalotis ? __label__3 I don ' t think I understand this question. If the sorted arrays are the index positions where the words occur, why are word1 and word2 both at index 4 and word2 and 3 at index 5 ? __label__3 Is the 2x4 laid across the ceiling joists? How widely spaced are the joists ? __label__3 Can you please explain what the two fields you added to the table at <url> are supposed to mean? What "reaction"?__label__3 The article <url> (written with two s) was rightly deleted as it contained almost no content (Timothy (Tim) Ferriss is the author of The 4 - Hour Workweek). I think you mean the science - fiction writer <url> (written wit one s) ?__label__3 community wiki? there isn ' t one right answer ? __label__3 How are you calling those modules? Can you provide some code or some example ? __label__3 In fact you did link, and the user has archived the page and gotten rid of it. Do you know which section he should be looking for ? __label__3 Let me rephrase your question. Whats the difference between fixed function rendering and Shaders ? __label__3 Will the characters always be the first n / 2 letters of the alphabet and the numbers be in the range [1 , n / 2]? Also, what happens when n / 2>=10, how are we required to handle multi - character numbers like "10","11",..?__label__3 It is incredibly unclear what the actual question here is. Is it just "what do you recommend for clustering / replication / failover options?"__label__3 Hi, what I ' m trying to establish is a reference for the assertion that Swails "may have been the first <url> commissioned as a officer in the <url> during the <url>". Does your source say that specifically ? __label__3 4. Are there any signed agreement with the Anglican Church in this regard ? __label__3 Hey, I think it broke again; the link doesn ' t show on [so]. Can you check ? __label__3 True, tho in reality I should have just blocked the sock tpar from the beginning. Don ' t we usually do that to force them to request unblocking on the main account ? __label__3 I have updated question. Can you please look at it ? __label__3 Working on it - sent an email to the people at the Cambridge U Library to see if they know where it ' s from. In the meantime, could you check with Jappalang that his concern about the infobox image has been addressed ? __label__3 @bear any gps enabled device. any recommended api ? __label__3 No. Why do you ask ? __label__3 I use UIImageJPGRepresentation (I know its PNG that you ' re using) in a separate thread quite intensively without any problem. Are you sure that the problem doesn ' t come from the imageReg that could be written in another thread ?__label__3 Define "same", i . e. do you mean = or == or something else ? __label__3 Can ' t you just generate the HTML code in a manner that marks the blocks which can be hidden with divs? Why are you bound to that representation ? __label__3 Regarding <person>, you ' ve made this a Beta - In Use template since January. Is there any hope of making it live at some point in the near future ? __label__3 not sure how the table is storing the tuples or if i ' m understanding correctly, but, don ' t you already have that information? if there is a table with the tuples, say, tuple _ table with tuples (kn, gm), and you want which k element (coming from set A) maps to which g element (coming from set B) wouldn ' t a simple select on the tuple _ table do it ? __label__3 An editor you recently blocked for a week, <url>, is now editing the same articles and topics under an IP account <url>. Is this allowed or should it just be ignored ? __label__3 Sorry, no clue. The help desk wasn ' t helpful, huh ? __label__3 Sorry, I ' m not sure I follow. How can I do that when I can ' t even boot into Ubuntu ? __label__3 The question isn ' t clear enough. What are you trying to achieve ? __label__3 OOP is banned. Can data structures be used ? __label__3 Unfortunately, on the topic you have chosen, the excellence of what you are doing is far from the only issue. Are you producing an excellent article of a kind that should not actually be in Wikipedia but in some other more specialized project ? __label__3 both just link to disambiguation pages, where the right people don ' t seem to be represented. Also, my information is that <url> took the post in 1889, while you have 1899. What was your source ? __label__3 Agreed. Can you tell at a higher level what you ' re trying to do ? __label__3 Hey. Did you get my last e - mail ? __label__3 I could make this work by defining the exact height and width of the "viewport": `<fo : external - graphic height="29 . 7cm" width="21cm" content - height="scale - down - to - fit" content - width="scale - down - to - fit" src=".."/>`. Can anybody explain to me why I apparently have to define that in my case ? __label__3 @diEcho & @MaKo. Oh wait, are you looking at searching on the server or with Javascript ? __label__3 what do you mean combined? overlapping area ? __label__3 Assume each string in Python has 30 bytes of overhead. If you multiply 30 bytes by the number of fields per record and the number of records (30M) and add in 1 . 5GB, what do you get ? __label__3 It ' s usually not a good idea to try and create images of text. Is it strictly necessary for you to do so ? __label__3 I think you made a mistake in merging <url> onto <url> instead of <url>. Or did you want to do further editing before actually adding the material into <url>?__label__3 Please elaborate. Did I give you enough info to do so ? __label__3 I am having the same problem. Anyone have any other ideas ? __label__3 Your request just slows down users, without changing what they see. Are you sure that is what you want ? __label__3 @Stephen Oh, sorry.. I misunderstood. (but u do see why u need to learn c /c++ right?)__label__3 I noticed that you removed the section " Failure to prevent the attacks" from the 9 / 11 attacks talk page yesterday and moved it unceremoniously to <url> without a single word of explanation. Please explain why ? __label__3 it might not be Windows that is doing this, but your display driver. Is it nVidia ? __label__3 Do you mean require a login to access them? Or do you mean prevent them from being saved out of the browser ? __label__3 Harmless for them? Or harmless for you when they come find their revenge ? __label__3 what warning? and which compiler ? __label__3 You are building a xFA for the _byte_ input? Wouldn ' t it be a lot easier (and more reliable) to operate on (Utf16) chars ? __label__3 This is mighty ambitious. Can you turn this into a question ? __label__3 If the rows are independent, why bother looking at it as a matrix? Just consider one row at a time.. Or am I missing something ? __label__3 what does that mean? how can I do that ? __label__3 Hi, I ' ve reverted the edits you made to <url> as the flags by the clubs put ' s the box totally out of sync (on explorer anyway). Can I suggest that you don ' t add these flags ? __label__3 Do you mean you only want the alternate caps inside of `"` delimited portions of your string, e . g. output should be `hello "HoW ArE YoU DoInG?"`.__label__3 This is a pretty fundamental difference. Are you sure you know what `this` is and what local variables are ? __label__3 Hoping that the good people at Conservapedia haven ' t tied you to a stake yet and you ' ll be back to witty banter at the MIT page ( s) sometime soon. Or otherwise enjoying a wikibreak ? __label__3 @lev: sorry, i didn ' t notice we are oscillating. You are asking whether $O ( n^3)$ is a lowerbound on the complexity of E .

In what sense, then, is anything "reversed"?__label__3 S . Lott: I wasn ' t aware that this is desired behaviour and not, simply, default behaviour.

Shouldn ' t this be `$('<img>')` instead of `$(img)`?__label__3 I don ' t think it is too unreasonable to archive messages you have read by deleting them - they are still available in the page history.

While compiling, linking, running ? __label__3 But if you change something for your entertainment, if no one catches that, it will misinform someone else. What if you go to Wikipedia to learn something, but someone has put in false information ? __label__3 It seems like the bot hasn ' t made any contributions in quite a while. Is something wrong ? __label__3 I am sorry you "don ' t like <url> tone", but I have made scrupulous efforts to be entirely civil. Your opinion of my tone apart, would you care to respond to my points ? __label__3  " above code is not working" isn ' t very descriptive. What happens when you try it ? __label__3 Also why is there no "set bounty" button on my question? Does it have to be a certain age ? __label__3 Parsley is very easy to grow. Could you buy some seeds and put them in a windowsill pot ? __label__3 Googling reveals update - grub will create a grub config file. Please forgive my ignorance, but what does this do and how will it help me ? __label__3 As far as I ' m aware it should work correctly. Could you provide an example ? __label__3 This is just too confusing..how can a team be an affiliate of the NHL team but not the AHL team? Especially in a AA hockey league ? __label__3 And why do you think it is an accepted guideline? Do you base this only on the presence of the tag or do you have some other benchmark ? __label__3 What kind of games? Any in particular ? __label__3 OK, I retract this completely: the IP hopper in question should..well, I ' m biting my tongue. Have you reported them for vandalism, with their half a dozen IP addresses ? __label__3 In your edit you specified inorder traversal, where in your original statement of the problem you specified preorder traversal. Which is it ? __label__3 +1 Cool, I think I have been invited to an event through this a very long time ago. Could you please make the link an actual link to the site and edit your answer to show anyvite measures up to the requirements ? __label__3 Did you mean to also remove the Breitbart reference from the "Incidents" section? Have I missed a meeting ? __label__3 We can, but that ' s just a page revision. The file revisions, containing the actual media, are the ones you want, no ? __label__3 Oh by the way I do drugs too, so we should get along together! Friends ? __label__3 @Sunil: and what does you input look like? What ' s the contents of cb . Text ? __label__3 I have never heard of the 1933 "freakish heat flash" in Coimbra, Portugal. Will you please provide some sources that you used for forming such a conclusion ? __label__3 @Bruce: I think you ' re reporting a quick google result, since you omit sharing features of D7 . 2, why anyone would extend D7, or why anyone owning a D7 license like me would have wanted such an extended version in 2003. Did you also find all the other versions of Delphi usually found on torrent sites ? __label__3 You just built an article called Fort Fort Mitchel. Did you mean to have two fort ' s in the title ? __label__3 What kind of text? English prose ? __label__3 This is most likely OS specific. Which operating system are you using ? __label__3 is this something you actually need to do in real life (i . e. some embedded system), or an academic / interview type question ? __label__3 I heard he will be on <url>. Do you know what roll he will be on DSDS ? __label__3 It ' s not the homework problem of anyone I know, but I suppose it could be. How does one write a challenge problem, to be documented on stackoverflow, that doesn ' t appear to be a "homework" problem ? __label__3 Umm, which code do you have a problem with? Could you be a little more specific with what the issue is ? __label__3 Oops, sorry about that. Delete ? __label__3 So it ' s not a copyright problem, but it still needs to be made clear that the text is copied from the source per <url>. Is there a corresponding template for Collier ' s similar to <person> where you ' re not just using it as a reference ? __label__3 You say; ''I don ' t preview TfD before I close it each day.'' How do you then determine consensus ? __label__3 Hey, did you ever read over the material I laid out for you - content as well as ideas for organization of an article? Any feedback ? __label__3 Didn ' t get it. What is it about ? __label__3 What would that do? Is that good ? __label__3 Depends on the size. Broiler - fryer ? __label__3  " Which other interesting things are there to count.." isn ' t that the actual question? Maybe adjust the title ? __label__3 It looks like those news sources are all poker blogs. Are there any that meet <url>?__label__3 Well it looks like a basic hill - climbing problem, for which my favorite method is [Metropolis - Hastings](http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Metropolis % E2 % 80 % 93Hastings _ algorithm). What ' s all that business about patents ? __label__3 Ok, but the army corps should be typed bigger than the brigades. How can I do that if the army corps aren ' t sections ? __label__3 Your question is unclear. Do you want the output to be a single stream like [1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6]?__label__3 We will need more information. Would you please open a terminal and post the result of "sudo fdisk -l"?__label__3 Please add more information, what exactly is your problem? What have you tried ? __label__3 Still highly POV. Shall we put pictures of human skeletons from Auschwitz on <url>?__label__3 it depends. Are these featured links derived from the DB or are they just arbitrary links ? __label__3 Quite unclear. Maybe `my _ hash . each{|k, v| puts k}` ?__label__3 Yes I did. Did you happen to check out <url>?__label__3 Do you absolutely _have_ to concatenate? Can ' t you use parameters instead ? __label__3 You ' ll have to give more information such as: what type of data are you rendering? do you have complex loops in your erb ? __label__3 Speaking of GregU ' s script, something in your script seems to be messing up the former. Do you know what it is ? __label__3 In this case, its the finite line segment. Is "line" called something else depending on if its finite or infinite ? __label__3 What ' s your question? Do you want to parse the entire record, understand the format of RRULE lines, something else ? __label__3 I think the error is in your index . php file (see my answer). can you pastebin the code of this file ? __label__3 Thought of good idea: Wikipedia : Babies who will one day rule Wikipedia (WP : BABE) for Wikipedians in middle school or younger. Whaddya think ? __label__3 By my reckoning he has been in every episode, and thats 10 so far.. I am confused as to why you changed it from 9 to 7 ? __label__3 i took the photo, and if the kludgy licensing template would allow me to license i would. do you actually fix things or tag spam ? __label__3 I ' m also a bit weary of this discussion, and I ' m afraid the central argument stands. But perhaps if you wish to continue it, you ' d do a bit of the searching, and report your results ? __label__3 The Wikipedia article on Boyer - Moore (http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Boyer % E2 % 80 % 93Moore _ string _ search _ algorithm) includes an explanation of Horspool ' s. Which parts of that explanation do you find unclear ? __label__3 Ashvini, if you cannot tell the difference between answering a question and posting a discussion, you shouldn ' t be working on software to begin with. Really, what the hell ? __label__3 The previous edit made by <url> was sufficient. If she edits the article again, reverting your edit, can we leave it be, for the sake of tranquility ? __label__3 Please clarify: Do you already have a table of network nodes with IDs or do you need to create IDs from scratch? If you have a nodes table, how does it look like ? __label__3 Okay, fair enough. But if they ' re necessary, could we find a less complex and eyeglazing ''name'' for them ? __label__3 At <url>, your 'outside comment' contains the statement "You don ' t go deleting things with a consensus, and then blast those who have the nerve to reprimand you. " This seems self - contradictory: did you mean to type 'without'?__label__3 Your bot runs awfully fast. How come there isn ' t "using AWB" in the edit summary ? __label__3 One last thought on groups claiming to be the FI - don ' t the <url>s claim to be the Fourth International? Or perhaps it ' s just *a* Fourth International ? __label__3 since the 2 cogs are interlocked. How would you suggest they can run 'out of phase'?__label__3 But the main question was that would it be a bad idea to make more articles about characters, orginizations and etc. in a book ? __label__3 Are we talking about using online sites such as Hulu? Or like recording and watching cable TV ? __label__3 What operating system do you use? Windows or Mac ? __label__3 It should prepopulate from that json url. Are you sure you followed the guide ? __label__3 Hello. Who are you, and when are we to have met or communicated in the past ? __label__3 It ' s clear that <url> isnt quite up to GA standards yet, I would like to withdraw my nomination. Can that be done ? __label__3 Are your brakes not working, or just making noise? The noise is fairly common for wet disk brakes. But do they still stop you ? __label__3  " It doesn ' t seem like there is anything here worth merging which isn ' t in other articles already" - in which articles? What is your knowledge of the Soviet system ? __label__3 Is it OK that I don ' t edit wikipedia? It ' s because lots of other people have done it but I don ' t want to so can I still go on ? __label__3 Why do you have 0 , 2 after 2 , 1 and 2 , 2 (and 3 , 1 before 0 , 3)? Why is 1 , 2 in twice ? __label__3 Is the program run as another user or root? Are you running as root ? __label__3 Please provide more details: will you host more websites on a server? How are you uploading files ? __label__3 Wait. I ' ve never edited that page ? __label__3 Hi. What was wrong with the Autamata page ? __label__3 You say that "it ' s no longer working", what have you changed? Does your `runcode2 . rb` start with `#!/usr / bin / ruby` or something similar ? __label__3 Ok, why was it wrong??__label__3 did ' t you just ask this on the Ubuntu Forum? Same person ? __label__3 What do mean by "theme"? a prompt theme ? __label__3 The above templated message explains pretty clearly why the image was deleted. Do you have any specific questions about this image or our policy on replaceable non - free content ? __label__3 Web Apps? How about Meta Stack Overflow? :)__label__3 The Daily Mail has republished pages from the manifesto in full, (<url>) including that of his personal data. Is this the ethical jump you need to use the info on Wikipedia ? __label__3 While I have your attention, can you explain the source of those images of Starfleet insignia that you uploaded? Is it jewelry that you own and / or made, and scanned / took pictures of, or..?__label__3 The language here is a little ambiguous. When you say Web Application Project do you mean loading the project in Visual Studio, or are you referring to the startup time of the application in IIS on the initial hit ? __label__3 How strange - you ' re apparently credited with its creation at <url>. Do you know who did create the image, by any chance ? __label__3 Are you sure you should use plural even refering to less - than - one numbers? Wouldn ' t it be 0 . 50 dollar ? __label__3 Reading symbols from /home / uranus / project / cvmat / cvmat..(no debugging symbols found)..done. while i compile source files with gcc -g option, how that happens ? __label__3 This is exactly the same situation as [NIS and autofs error](http://unix . stackexchange . com / questions / 4547 / nis - and - autofs - error), down to the example user name. Do you have a problem with account association, is this homework, are you both following the same tutorial, or what ? __label__3 Is this homework? What have you so far ? __label__3 This IP - 188 . 50 . 98 . 153, its intention seems to be language fundamentalism, gave a level - 3 warning..Any way to protect this article so that only established users can edit it??__label__3 Did you install a FULL version of Visual Studio Professional? What happens if you force open the dmp file ? __label__3 Are both versions being run as the same user? Whats in `$?` when it fails ? __label__3 @phoog Ah, and haha, read this question: "it ' s not homework". It seems that he ' s creating square wheels in some company (or maybe he ' s freelance?).__label__3 Where is `$valueToUnserialize _ or _ stringMessage` coming from? What do you want to unserialize ? __label__3 Is this homework? IF so, can you be more specific about what you don ' t understand ? __label__3 How do you know it doesn ' t work? What if you use an absolute path instead of a relative one ? __label__3 It looks like the string is double encoded: first Html Encoded and then URL encoded. Why is that so ? __label__3 What kind of riding will you be doing? Does it have to be on the bike ? __label__3 If you stay at the CGI level _any_ language can be used for web development. Anything in particular you need ? __label__3 Firstly, I think we ' re gonna need to see some source for the page you ' re having problems with. Secondly, have you tried a "View source" on the resulting page to see if there ' s anything else in there ? __label__3 What a disturbing video. Maybe we should donate a few copies of <url> to CNN.. And what ' s up with the 2 ad - breaks in 13 minutes ? __label__3 @S . Lott: No, I ' m saying that looking up the function is far from easy if the obvious search terms don ' t readily yield any insights. Am I missing something ? __label__3 The English Wikipedia seems to be the only one still up. Does anybody know what is going on ? __label__3 Aha, a ten Monitor ma swoja wlasna page do ktorej by mozna latwo linkowac? Moze by nawet mozna zrobic "mu" wlasne account ? __label__3 Who inherits the chiefship of <url> now? Does ''legitimatio per subsequens matrimonium'' apply ? __label__3 I tried "diskusage" and it should give you the exact distribution of your internal ROM.

How ' s the project going along ? __label__3 Dupe of http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 132319 / storing - objects - for - locating - by - xy - coordinates # 132393. Any reason to keep this version open ? __label__3 In <url>, people seemed to agree with you, but I just don ' t understand your proposal. So, what exactly do you mean in terms of category renaming / merging / recategorization ? __label__3 Ok I ' ve moved <url> back to <url>. Oleg you want to write something on the talk page about the move ? __label__3 It strikes me that you ' re not really looking for an algorithm. What inputs will you provide, and what output do you expect to have after you perform the algorithm ? __label__3 I ' ll have a look (probably just for copyediting duties) once Zag has finished the larger changes. Keep me posted ? __label__3 It seems like you are having some difficulty with understanding how we <url> and what we mean by <url>. Taking a look over those links, can you see why other editors thought your statements and concerns were out of line with our content policies ? __label__3 Do you mean braces, brackets or both? Many interpretations- http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Bracket Argument list, code body, or both (the entire expression ? __label__3 Is this your photo? Is this the tall tower that ' s in the downtown area ? __label__3 Whoops. How about now ? __label__3 Yes, shed a bit more light on your situation, please. Is this something to take in addition to your core coursework or are you trying to determine if RA is part of your core ? __label__3 Which authorities are you referring to? Can you give the name of a linguist / grammarian who considers that removing the accents from a French, Polish or Serbian person ' s name creates an exonym ? __label__3  " two pigeons in a row constitute a half - wave antenna at 700 MHz" That ' s a pretty cool intersection of radio invisible waves seems - like - magic and real - life objects! On the other hand, did you perhaps just crack the secret for implementing <url>?__label__3 *@matt*: +1 to the suggestion by *@Chris _ O*. Also, maybe you should launch such a crowd - function site for WordPress Projects ? __label__3 mod _ perl? Plack ? __label__3 Speaking of, I stared at the moon last night and didn ' t see anything special. What was I supposed to see ? __label__3 What has this got to do with the article? Is this in the right place ? __label__3 This really just boils down to "You ' re used to Windows." doesn ' t it ? __label__3 I agree, and that is something that I have believed to be the case for a few weeks now, but Coaster7 won ' t let me make any significant changes that would result as such. So has it been propsed that the material be merged ? __label__3 Creating and improving images, or just placing them in articles / making sure they have the right copyrights / etc.?__label__3 Why can ' t you just put the data in a database and let that organise the data for the fastest search results (i . e. indices on the criteria you will search the data by)?__label__3 Are you trying to compare pointers to the same dictionary? Or is the other dictionary a distinct dictionary that just happens to have equivalent keys and values ? __label__3 All my edits to clear Lloyd George disappeared from the running count. They haven ' t been undone, is this a bug ? __label__3 You had said at CFD that you were allowing some time for <url> to be listified.

Why don ' t do a redirection ?__label__3 No actually the problem is that there is NO such header as iostream . h 1.#include <iostream> 2. instead of main() wwrite int main(). And third, before main after include write using namespace std; Still errors ? __label__3 My browser sometimes closes up when I come to this site. Why ? __label__3 Zero has taken a break from Wikipedia, and RK has recused himself from editing controversial articles. Why don ' t you and I fix up the <url> article now ? __label__3 done. Also, I edited your title to be easier to scan -- is this what you had in mind ? __label__3 @robin @peter: It isn ' t clear to me that it ' s an exact duplicate either. Are you both referring to the one I linked above or another one ? __label__3 Which operating system are you running VS . Net 2010 on / running the program on? Is it a Winforms, WPF or another technology application that you ' ve created ? __label__3 @g0d1anier: I ' m just curious, is there a reason you want to use multithreading for this? It seems to me that your program will be completely I / O bound so you ' re adding a lot of complexity for little benefit ? __label__3 What do you mean by "deleting through Visual Studio"? You mean "in code"?__label__3 How doesn ' t it work? Does the image appear at all, or just nothing ? __label__3 Is there a particular reason you need it in binary format? Could you not use simple text output ? __label__3 Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I remember a nice theorem in one of Knuth ' s fascicles that said a boolean function is self - dual iff it can be expressed as the composition of majority functions. Has this observation been used in any algorithm for that problem ? __label__3 Things are going to break if you get rid of the `.Designer . cs` file. Why do you want to do this ? __label__3 Perhaps you need to define 'best'. Also did you mean 3D k - sided polyhedron instead of polygon ? __label__3 can you explain how / why rocking your bike reduces your gear ratio ? __label__3 @cowgod I ' m not sure what the benefit would be because I haven ' t played any of those. Is it the added realism or something ? __label__3 define 'confused'. What are you getting for Total . text ? __label__3 .. and why `preg _ match _ all()`? Why not just `preg _ match`?__label__3 What should happen if "Some Filename" and "some _ filename" both exist in the same directory? And for non - empty directories "Some Dir" and "some _ dir" with the same parent ? __label__3 Maybe a misspelling, or just having one of those brain fade days (which I suffer often). Did you mean defer or refrain in that opening line in your comment ? __label__4 @carleeto: Have you tried the various suggestions in the answers? 15 minutes? Wow . __label__4 OK, fair enough. But it ' s still not a SO question ? __label__4 You just created that article - but maybe you haven ' t noticed there ' s already <url>, which covers the same character set, as the ISO followed the Thai standard. Maybe you should merge your additions there, and make TIS - 620 a redirect ? __label__4 sorry, no idea what the code should do. Is the selected in the db or what ? __label__4 Emmy, Have you found a solution for this ? __label__4 I understood just fine, but wasn ' t at my computer. Are you in a hurry ? __label__4 One wonders, of course, who "Elliott of Macedon" would have been. Probably something analogous to Brian of Nazareth but in a Macedonian phalanx ? __label__4 I don ' t think anyone ' s going to be able to help you based on that information alone (considering we don ' t know what `0x306aeaa5` is). Can you post your code and tell us what the exact problem is ? __label__4 What "fact" that was recently prooved is referred to? And since when is pi the ratio of circumference to radius, rather than circumference to diameter ? __label__4 how much have you studied yet? Do you want specific questions ? __label__4 In instances where there is one major usage of a name and several smaller ones it is conventional to leave the major one in the namespace and have a link in the top to the others (or to <url>. Surely 99 . 9% of people interested in <url> are going to be looking for the main one, so wouldn ' t it have made more sense to have left it there rather than making it a redirect ? __label__4 Why are the results bad? Can you elaborate on what you did ? __label__4 Strange, because it should use the Intel chipset drivers to run the USB. Have you updated to the latest Boot Camp ? __label__4 Is your problem that you don ' t know why the cost of the cycle 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 is 37? Or is it that you don ' t know how to do the backtracking ? __label__4 I don ' t understand this answer. What ' s the 2' piece for? Are you assuming the beams are made from a single thickness of 2 - by lumber ? __label__4 There you go, it ' s GA now. Have you done anything else that ' s gotten to GA ? __label__4 Why do you want to show multiple tooltips for a single control? Why not just combine the contents of the two into a single tooltip ? __label__4 Wikipedia is not the place for new information. How would we know if it was true or not if someone credible hasn ' t verified it ? __label__4 See my comment on the talk page. How did this ever get to DYK ? __label__4 Usually you don ' t get answers, if you don ' t show effort of solving things by yourself first. So, what are your thoughts, what is your proposed solution, what is clear and what is unclear to you ? __label__4 So currently, you ' re on 3 . 1 . 2, correct? When you downgraded, did you use a stock firmware, or did you just put the redsn0w image on there right away ? __label__4 Would you be so kind as to show a schematic of your receiver? Are you supplying the bias voltage of 1 . 9 V ? __label__4 define 'normal stovetop' .. gas or electric ?__label__4 See my recent edit as he was not charged for one of the events so not all are criminal. What do you mean by my identification ? __label__4 Okay, so I did what it said and I sent a message to an admin. Now what do I do ? __label__4 What ' s wrong with it? Isn ' t making a wordpress theme programming ? __label__4 Yes. It references the static in A just fine, just not in B. I see why this is a problem since A may have no visibility to B ' s statics. I ' m asking if there is another way to do this ? __label__4 @Joonas: What about the solution posted by Benjamin Manns? That does not work for you ? __label__4 Hardly. Does the <url> exercise executive control over Northern Ireland ? __label__4 I just tried an empty field in Lightroom 3, and it seems to be working as you & I would expect: all photos without a setting on that field are being included. Is there a chance some other setting on your collection is tripping it up ? __label__4 Also, @Ahh or Cedric, can you please edit the question title so it asks "for modern physics" instead of general background? And by modern physics, do you mean quantum mechanics, relativity, quantum electrodynamics, and particle physics ? __label__4 You ' ve violated <url> on <url>, with 2 reverts in half an hour. Would you like to revert yourself to avoid being blocked again ? __label__4 this is now the fourth question about the same addcube() function. perhaps there is a larger issue here that just indices ? __label__4 How do you come up with 57? Are you allowed to divide by 2 ? __label__4 I notice that your userpage announces that this is an alternate account and won ' t get involved in policy. Did you always have that attitude, or is it since December last year ? __label__4 @zr: **How is 0x5f7ff "even" but 0x5f800 is not?** What exactly do you mean by *nearest even*?__label__4 Which ones? Activision, MS, all? :)__label__4 Yes, I had to wait about 18 minutes or whatever it was, in that time I forgot to come back and accept it. Do I always have to wait for these flood checks ? __label__4 ..and, really, BeeGees? And not Peter Frampton ? __label__4 I am totally and completely baffled by what is meant by "not one that happens every Thurs evening at the local church, but rather the big store". What is "the big store"?__label__4 <url> has been promoted to A - class. Shouldn ' t that score ? __label__4 This doesn ' t make sense. Do you mean "introspection"?__label__4 Actually, I thought that I was moving to the end of the list. I must be missing what is the issue with putting a (revised) picture at the end of the list ? __label__4 What is the purpose of knowing if they are using the computer or not? What happens if they are not ? __label__4 Does it REALLY have to be IrfanView? Why not a free library like FreeImage or ImageMagick ? __label__4 We need a visual of some kind. How ' s the state of your right - brain today ? __label__4 I think I misunderstood. Is the peak perpendicular to the garage door, or parallel ? __label__4 40 kbps is fast enough to load the full facebook . com in about a minute. Is that even worth it ? __label__4 Where are you using this code? Have you tried `theme _ get _ setting('logo _ path', 'THEME _ NAME')`, replacing THEME _ NAME with the name of your theme ? __label__4 I note also that so far you seem to be the sole editor who favors deletion, while several have favored retention of the article, possibly with editing. Could it be that your view does not command consensus ? __label__4 If there was another film that had the same title and wasn ' t disambiguated on the 1961 film ' s page or the short story ' s page, then I cannot be held responsible. How was I to know that there was another film ? __label__4 Damn it! Should we just revert back to the beginning of the day, since what I wrote was based on analyzing the satellite data ? __label__4 Lionel, tell me the truth. How long have you known BelloMello was wMo ? __label__4 @omri yes you are right.. I have applied the logic acc. to what I thought is right if somebody could tell me what ' s wrong I have done ??__label__4 Why not just generate the autocompletion configuration based on your YAML file? The options won ' t be changing all the time so why bother trying to make the autocompletion configuration dynamic ? __label__4 I advance (Ultra - Orthodox) Rabbi Dr Mordechai Halperin, (Ultra - Orthodox), Rabbi Gershon Winkler, (Conservative) Rabbi Elliot Dorff, to you, for example, that the Torah and Talmud only forbids anal sex. Now explain exactly what division of Judaism is left, for you to claim your view fairly represents ? __label__4 These events are fictional. What real - world information can there be about them ? __label__4 Have a look at the edit to <url>. Is this page even a dab ? __label__4 Did you mean to post this answer to a different question? If not, could you please clarify how an answer about adding filters to custom post types has anything to do with using a tagging plugin ? __label__4 @Nightfirecat Well, the normal `<hr />` isn ' t enough contrast from the background to provide me with what I need. So, creating a 1x3 image and a 100x3 image doesn ' t really change the speed at all ? __label__4 I noticed you deleted this while I was in the middle of creating it. Does the listing of it on the <url> not make it notable ? __label__4 I ' m always behind the times. PS- When did you guys decide to ''remove'' the Quebecois nation resolution from that article ' s introduction ? __label__4 Career advice questions like this one are too localized for this site.

Is there an issue ? __label__4 Don ' t you mean 2N edges? And you want the matching to include all nodes, correct ? __label__4 I didn ' t remove the image; I just moved it down to the bottom of the box, to avoid having a long stack of images at the top.

What exactly is your intention with that image ? __label__4 Sounds like possible homework. What have you tried ? __label__4 just curious, why do you change filters so often ? __label__4 The sources are ref ' d in the article. Can you be more specific ? __label__4 Dude, what ' s going on? Why are you leaving ? __label__4 That ' s basically what our members have said, not necessarily my opinion. Anything I miss ? __label__4 Yes, I am using an "ancient" version: OS X 10 . 4 . 11 and XCode 2 . 5! Is that the problem ? __label__4 My impression is that it depends on the culture that ' s making the pie.. in France, apple pie is a tart with one crust, but American apple pie traditionally has two. Anyone know ? __label__4 @Marc: Could you, please, make more precise your statement "two paths are different iff they use different child nodes in a branching node". You mean they ' re different if there is such a branching node where they use different child nodes ? __label__4 This should possibly be a comment / clarification to original question. Can they be merged ? __label__4 Based on what? Don ' t you think a little discussion is in order before doing this ? __label__4 you ' re gonna need to explain what you mean a little better. Is this even a programming question or are you trying to figure out how yahoo mail works ? __label__4 What exactly are you asking? Are you asking for good examples for books to use, good things to try while learning, or just our opinion about the difficulty of examples ? __label__4 What ' s "Web of Knowledge"? Where is this "javascript form"?__label__4 Why can ' t you just split every job to three equal sized parts (e . g. 100 = 33 + 33 + 334) and always run only one job at a time, and through all the three lines ? __label__4 I dislike feuds. What to do ? __label__4 Any word on what happened to it? Did you get a chance to talk to your instructor ? __label__4 Huh, language agnostic God objects. Ironic ? __label__4 I ' m slightly surpirised that this post just got to 1k views and still there ' s no voting on the answers. Is that just laziness, are viewers lacking voting rights or is there something wrong with the answer ( s)?__label__4 Give us more code. What it `$res`?__label__4 I have just noticed that today a Wikipedia administrator added a POV tag in the u201cPsychohistoryu201d article, which you have contributed to edit. Perhaps someone should do a little work to balance the article and remove the tag ? __label__4 I notice that to the <url> and <url> pages edited ''Gorka'' ''Josxe9 Unda Velasco'' and changed it to simply ''Gorka''. Why ? __label__4 You mean _orthogonal_ forms? right ? __label__4 What ' s your question? Whether or not to use MonoDroid ? __label__4 Why would a battery be less efficient with higher voltage? It ' s just a bigger number of same low - voltage cells, isn ' t it ? __label__4 Oh, it ' s not that big of a deal. Drew, which IP edit did you consider to be "attacking"?__label__4 @Metalshark, this question has not received any unique answers, and I believe is probably close enough to a duplicate to close. Any objections ? __label__4 Why do you want to do this in the first place? You ' re already using managed code, why not use the BCL ' s [regex class](http://msdn . microsoft . com / en - us / library / system . text . regularexpressions . regex . aspx)?__label__4 If you wrote the CGI script, then you know how that script determines where to put the files and how to name them. What is stopping you from adding that information to a database ? __label__4 Where did you get the file from? What is the name / extension of the file ? __label__4 Outside or inside? Is there are paint or enamel or anything on the wood already ? __label__4 Why, precisely? And what separates the etiquette of your area of society from our "conventional etiquette" speed - developed on the Internet ? __label__4 I realize that. If Angry Birds doesn ' t make any provision for backing up and storing state data on the SD, how would a 3rd party app be able to over ride the Angry Birds state without over writing the information that I assume is stored somewhere in the /data/ directory (which you do need root to access)?__label__4 Where have you put this material? On a user page somewhere ? __label__4 The real question is , what does First returns? Since Dictionnary uses hash values, First is first of what??__label__4 So they ' re const global variables. Big deal..?__label__4 Language? Framework ? __label__4 There are 6190283353629375 ways to pair up 30 people. Do you really want all of them ? __label__4 - millions of people are using it to get help our service is free of charge. Since it ' s a tech support site you can ' t claim that it ' s not related to the article either (if you disagree with that just google for "consumer electronics tech support" see who comes first).We are here to server the community - why do you find it so offensive ? __label__4 it **only** affects the object that has been created in the last loop - round? or, it **also** affects the object that has been created in the last loop - round ? __label__4 My god, the code got all mangled. The insert code capability here is atrocious, just mangles the code and leaves out tags.. How do I fix this ? __label__4 Link? Is this homework ? __label__4 I must be missing something here. Would you mind clarifying for me the nature of your extensive work on <url>?__label__4 Nope, no sense. What ' s a conceptual break in this context ? __label__4 See <url>. I assume you didn ' t mean <url> ?__label__4 er, no that wont work. It wud still complain about that error, wont it ? __label__4  # I am still convinced the long page on "prostatitis" (a misnomer in the case of CPPS) is confusing, with too many sections and subsections, and would benefit from restructuring and the creation of separate pages for each area, or at the very least the removal of the CPPS section to its own, in depth page. You were the only editor to object to this going ahead, with this comment: "So, suggest keep this on hold for now, but in principle one might similarly split off other classification categories with this then just umbrella simple introduction." Do you still hold this view ? __label__4 He has said its for ASP! or am I missing something ? __label__4 Many thanks for the review. So what was the truce term ''you'' used when little then ? __label__4 Your Frequently Asked Question is answered in the very first sentence: "perldoc -q match" --> "I ' m having trouble matching over more than one line. What ' s wrong?"__label__4 , and <url> hot. What more could a young man need ? __label__4 @Lev: Your graph model can be seen as the sum of d independently chosen random graphs where each vertex chooses a next neighbour uniformly at random. This would seem to make analysis easier ? __label__4 Back on topic Jigglyfidders; I totally agree with Deconstructhis on this one. What will you do to address this issue ? __label__4 You reverted my removal of the "to critical acclaim" description from this article. I cannot see where in <url> there is a basis for that claim - it looks like a neutral factual review to me ? __label__4 Hyphenation in English is a pain (and worth a PhD thesis or two) but I remember learning the Castillian hyphenation rules in school as a child, so it would seem to be much simpler (unless I ' m missing something, of course). Is hyphenation in Asturian all that different from Castillian ? __label__4 I was not trying to sound rude earlier. Haunted Angel which of my seven reasons had you decided were evidence of his sock puppetry ? __label__4 We already list Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia separately. Along with Belarus and Ukraine, that doesn ' t leave much of the USSR that was occupied, does it ? __label__4 feel free to share the specifics of the space, it ' s quite relevant to the question. Is the space ' s shape odd, or is it hard to get to, or what ? __label__4 See <url>. Are <url> and <url> the same team ? __label__4 @user597861: That looks like Java. Why aren ' t you just using `A . length`?__label__4 <url> Am I missing something ? __label__4 Why don ' t you use the DEBUG flag directly instead of 'delegating' the function to a class variable? It sounds like that telephone game, 'Chinese Whispers' (?)__label__4 You created an object of class `A`. Why would a `print _ r` in some instance of class `B` have access to something you changed in a different instance of class `A`?__label__4 Why would your application need such a structure? What are you doing ? __label__4 I ' m curious how you justify your removal of a link to the Washington Blade newspaper website in the <url> article<url>. The Blade is a valid media outlet - a newspaper dating back to 1969. Is there some bias at work ? __label__4 How about Guant who plays Pansy? Or Richard Fish who played Bill Weasley, and the actor who played Charlie Weasley in POA ? __label__4 I state what I see when I read it. Are you and <url> the same editor ? __label__4 Okay, but everything has to do with physics. Is there a survival . SE? :)__label__4 Do you mean "What can you do with Drush that goes beyond what you can do through the Drupal web interface?" or "Can Drush be used for things besides Drupal?"__label__4 With 6 rows you will end up with ids 1 - 5 having value 166 and id 6 with value 170. Sure you want that ? __label__4 When were closures for JDK 7 cancelled? You have a link confirm this ? __label__4 Testing, testing, 1 , 2, 3, are you still alive? Where are you ? __label__4 So a fixed gear with no brakes would count? I mean, using the pedals to stop the rear wheel does qualify, no ? __label__4 Man, I ' m discovering that Commons is lousy with copyrighted product packaging, there are ''thousands'' of them, I think. I am AWB - challenged, if I start compiling a list, perhaps you could eventually turn AWB loose on it ? __label__4  - 1: For not specifying what is to be done later with the data. If you claim the question is open - ended (interview and all) then why accept an answer ? __label__4 What ' s with all the crap behind him? Was this at a signature desk ? __label__4 What platform? Mac, Windows, Linux ? __label__4 Im interested in where you got the information you added stating woodlands house was closed in 2003. As far as i can see your wording was taken from one website, the milesfaster one. Should you not cite the website you quoted rather than look for a couple of others ? __label__4 give me your personal opinion, is an article with citations and written in a mature manner, about shart, ever going to remain without being deleted? or will i just waste my time if i make it ? __label__4 Did you already ask this question? But i think the file path for tabify could be playing up??__label__4 That ' s a <url>-length rant. Still, be nice and AGF, okay ? __label__4 You mean the OS - specific printing interface? How can the OS - specific printing API be magically OS independent ? __label__4 My problem is that the Style Guide for cities causes several topics for this small village to be repeated somewhat, especially the railroad, Gas Boom, and stockyard. Any thoughts on this article ' s organization ? __label__4 you mean as if you ' d print screen it ? or what ? __label__4 Do you still can use build - in rails validation with this custom exception class? Haven ' t you blogged about it ? __label__4 99% of my use is C++ .. I don ' t know what they did but it ' s horrid. Have you tried using a remote debugger or another instance of visual studio and attaching to the process ? __label__4 Not sure why I got <url> from you. Had I tagged it ? __label__4 And "..definitions..". What do you mean by "..definitions.."?__label__4 Too vague - explain what you expect the contents of the array to be afterwards - give a concrete example. Possibly also needs a homework tag ?__label__4 Let ' s pretend that we have reached an impasse and then we can stop talking to each other. Deal ? __label__4 What a mess. Does anything need to be done about it at the moment ? __label__4 Actually, I am concerned that you had completely removed verifiable facts of which I had included the references. Would you please explain why you had removed the entire section I wrote on Collection Agencies in Canada ? __label__4 Wikipedia is anything ''but'' formal, many characters real or fictional don ' t get referred by their full names all the time. Besides, who else on wikipedia thinks "OO" is awkward ? __label__4 Turkish boys are circumcised they are Muslim ' s. Why did you delete it ? __label__4 You want *all* the paths? You want *all simple paths containing at least two members of the subset*?__label__4 I ' ve noticed that you ' re engaged in several edit wars, with Meliniki, regarding minor alterations to multiple Greek language articles. Perhaps you should consider discussing the changes on Meliniki ' s <url> instead ? __label__4 I don ' t think I ' ll ever understand the "subjective and argumentative" thing for community Wikis. If nobody ' s getting rep, what harm does it do ?__label__4 You don ' t have a file handle, you have a file *name*. Which does the subroutine expect ? __label__4 Dana, before I give the examples of what sections or parts in the article that needs fixing, I need to know if <url> is still gonna work on the problems. Do you get me ? __label__4 Would 'volatile' really have that effect in C? Don ' t you mean 'register'?__label__4 I ' m sorry, but I don ' t see the value in having different criteria for two versions of the same list, one sorted by name and one sorted by nationality. Every other list and article on space travel uses the altitude definition, why would the sub - list sorted by nationality be different ? __label__4 @sepp2k isn ' t fnc declaration and "worded" postcondition sufficient for this task (I wasn ' t given definition at all by the way)? What for would one need to see guts of a fnc in order to be able to give formal proof for postcondition ? __label__4 I ' ve just started seeing this same problem after the latest Froyo OTA upgrade. Maybe that ' s related ? __label__4 @code: Heh - heh.. missed that. Can you please add [StackCenter](http://stackapps . com / questions / 114 / stackcenter - your - one - stop - for - everything - stackexchange) to your list of apps that use Soapi . JS ? __label__4 No. Distribued between what and what? Are those numbers independent or not ? __label__4 It ' s not off topic, and I see no comment in that other discussion on the merits of WMC ' s Martian push -- in fact, you evaded the question. So I take it that this is a refusal to answer ? __label__4 Yikes. Don ' t stoves usually provide heat that ' s too uneven and would tend to stress and break glass ? __label__4 I can ' t remember if I asked / checked to see if it got to you? So.. did it ? __label__4 Not trying to pick a fight - a user that reverts all articles to a version by you is suspect. Any New Year ' s resolutions Will ? __label__4 How far have you gotten? What kind of code have you written ? __label__4 Are you trying to validate the file somehow somewhere? Why does the file need to be only available on create ? __label__4 All programming exercises apply to all languages. What are you asking ? __label__4 If you know nothing about the structure of the URLs, then it ' s impossible to do.

Then let me ask you, what exactly was offensive about them ? __label__4 Why are you attempting to do multi - threaded UI?

So what ' s the reading of this word &#19981;&#24525;?__label__4 If the zeros are not valid data, why are they in the vector to begin with? If they are valid, why would you not want to StdDev to account for them ? __label__4 Why would you need to parse the HTML that you are generating? Are you going to need to be able to insert inline HTML that could invalidate ? __label__4 @Vlad: then why is there a problem? If you make each tile say 5 bytes (that 1 byte + entityID) and every entity contains it ' s position, then everything is O ( 1) right ? __label__4 There ' s too little information. How about posting some code ? __label__4 Stating which model of MBP you have will help, as the architecture changes over time. Assuming Unibody, at least ? __label__4 This is programming related.

What do you do when the stack has 10 entries and you need to output a number, but the last number hasnt arrived yet ? __label__4 I don ' t really get it. In your terminology, is there someone practicing Germanic paganism who is not a neopagan ? __label__4 You ' ll need to store something server - side.

Can you post the logcat ? __label__4 FYI, perhaps you failed to notice, but Anthropologist ' s "accursed" faux pas was already brought to his attention by Philbrick. I think you ' ll probably agree that a second, dedicated TP section is a bit of an overkill, no ? __label__4 This depends on the version of Drupal. Which version are you using ? __label__4 Not that clear to me. What ' s wrong with this username ? __label__4 Why the downvote? Am I missing something ? __label__4 What are you asking? How to modify a stored procedure using SQL, or how to send a SQL command to the server ? __label__4 And <url> targets <url>.

What do you think of <url>?__label__4 Why would you copy an egg? Did not introduced yourself to `virtualenv` yet ? __label__4 I see where someone put "April Fool ' s" in a revision, but otherwise, there was no other humor included, the page was utilitarian otherwise, and you can ' t move a category (meaning I would have to delete it anyway). Do we ''really'' need to retain this ? __label__4 pass from where? what ' s your desired use - case ? __label__4 It looks like you will have the device powered for most of the time that you have valid data.

It doesn ' t seem to be advertising or promoting anything ? __label__4 Why the removal of the citation dealing with coriolis? Was the proof not within the citation, or was the citation not considered primary ? __label__4 While watching the contribs I noticed that the bot blanked <url> which has already been checked and is listed at <url>.

A past vandal or something ? __label__4 At first blush this question seems purely mathematical: visualizing the function has nothing to do with the distribution of its arguments. However, the reference to "heteroskedasticity" suggests you ' re really trying to visualize an object that is more explicitly represented as $f ( x _ 1, .., x _ k) + \epsilon$ or more generally as $g ( f ( x _ 1, .., x _ k), \epsilon)$ where $epsilon$ is a zero - mean random variable and $g ( z , 0) = z$ for all z.

If you add the tap recognizer to self . view does THAT work ? __label__4 So I have no authority and am not the chief ed, but you have the authority to give me chances. Are you the chief ed ? __label__4 ya it is! am i not supposed to ask hw questions here ? __label__4 How is the result of your code different from that shown in the article?

I can debug in my local IIS but I don ' t see the files anywhere ? __label__4 I solved the problem, and I can assure you it is trivial. Is it homework or not ? __label__4  " Wordpress is not designed performance wise in the end" Making wild statements like that with no proof or backup is just flamebait.

How are these related ? __label__4 What do you mean by "moving"? Moving around in your window or a moving image like a *.gif ? __label__4 I am pretty sure SendGrid has this type of import and throttling build into their service. Why are you *doing it yourself*?__label__4 Speaking of FPC closures, is it common practice to close the likes of the Emu feeding video or the White Ibis, which had nothing but weak supports and supports (not enough total votes, but that was all) as "Not Promoted"?

Wouldn ' t the drier ingredient absorb more water ? __label__4 You ' re welcome to revert edits, but I ' m puzzled as to why you reverted this one - it seems absolutely essential to me the give a summary of Genesis 1. And if you revert Gen1, why leave Gen2 ? __label__5 **@Karel** Can you expand on your comment about diffraction, perhaps as an answer? Why would the 7D differ in this respect to any other camera body - isn ' t all the glass in the lens ? __label__5 Sorry Rarst how do you mean markup? Do you mean is everthing where it should etc, in correct divs and so on ? __label__5 One idea: don ' t. Why do you think you need to do this ? __label__5 <url> was a bit bad form. Think twice before you do it again ? __label__5 @BCS - A computer - controlled analog EQ sounds oxymoronic to me. Please correct me if I ' m wrong, but won ' t any digitally controlled pot be, well, digital, and the microcontroller and / or pot introduce switching noise when you change the pot ' s value ? __label__5 I ' m sorry, but it ' s still not clear. Are you saying that it _is_ correct grammar ? __label__5 What problem are you trying to solve? Are you sure cron is the right solution ? __label__5 WHADDAFUCK YA GONNA DO TO ME, HUH BITCH!??__label__5 For source control reasons? Can you please explain ? __label__5 I want a pony. Now we ' re done sharing what we want, did you have a question ? __label__5 How can you possibly know that? Have you tried to find additional content and failed to find it ? __label__5 I ' d like to know why someone voted to close this as Off - Topic. Can you please explain your reasoning ? __label__5 I ' ve never been able to get Mail . app to use the Exchange account that Google provides for mobile device use. Any chance they ' re using Google ? __label__5 In my calculation if I got blocked that would only be good for me as it would clear my mind from the obsession to try and change that which seems wrong and mutable, but carries no private benefits for the reformer. Is that line of thinking truly alien to you ? __label__5 what exactly do you have in mind? Sampling or search applications ? __label__5 That ' s "fucking consistent naming - schemers", please. Unless there ' s some actual reason for a) restriction to highways, b) infeasibly small stub categories, and c) inconsistent capitalisation ? __label__5 Have you made sure that these calculations take place in code that is executed often enough to cause a performance impact? Or do I have to post the micro - optimization lecture again ? __label__5 Does anyone know how to estimate a difference in difference regression in gretl? Do I have to work with OLS or panel data ? __label__5 O RLY? And what does it do there ? __label__5 Why haven ' t you submitted the diet to GA? And when are you going for FAC ? __label__5 What do you mean by "not a derivative of Formula 3 article"? Why did you feel compelled to remove the link to the main F3 article off the top of all the F3 sub - articles ? __label__5 Wow, is it my writing or what? This is my first ever question in StackOverflow and all I get is misunderstanding??__label__5 What is wrong, are you making a comment to Elderathis answer, or are you adding your own answer? If you ' re adding your own answer please expand a bit on this, I don ' t believe the base Clockworkmod can help you unless you ' ve previously done full ROM backups, or follow the links on Elderathis post to get hold of the approriate ROMs (stock or custom)?__label__5 It ' s not Bowdlerism to delete nonsensical trivia about which movies an actress appears nude in. Should we indicate what color her hair is in those movies ? __label__5 Open a console and run `badblocks` as well as `fsck . ext4`. Do those programs report errors ? __label__5 That ' s correct behavior. What don ' t you like about it ? __label__5 Seems like a very odd design for web applications. Would you mind to explain why MVCC does not work for you ? __label__5 Well this seems odd to me. Don ' t you find it strange that otherwise authoritative sources like Emulex and IBM would be so full of mistakes ? __label__5 @:closers: why off topic? Mind to explain ? __label__5 As a side note, I ' m slightly amused that on the one hand, you caution me not to "encourage" the penguieater troll, explicitly striking out the "mocking" part, but then in the same breath you sign the finding that cites those same penguin diffs as evidence of terrible insults and intimidation. Slightly inconsistent, perhaps ? __label__5 Excuse me? What are you accusing me of doing ? __label__5 Sovereignty is something a thing, in this case Japan, possesses, hence the apostrophe. So what ' s the problem ? __label__5 Holy steaming <url>. I presume you know about the <url>, yes ? __label__5 So, what specificaly is it that you have problems with? Is it that you don ' t understand the assignment ? __label__5 Do you really believe that your photograph at the top of the <url> is better than my photograph which you removed? Should Wikipedia have a dedicated sunrise article that does not feature even one single decent image of a red sky ? __label__5 It ' s a pretty dumb question. Who is asking you this ? __label__5 What do you mean by missing file songs? Do you have items in your iTunes library that are non - existant of your hard drive ? __label__5  ' copy public link' doesn ' t show on my dropbox. what happen ? __label__5 Thank you, I will give this a try tomorrow but could you please explain how to do different validations. For example validating for an correct email address, validating that there are no more than or at least XX characters, that a form field is filled out.. things like that ? __label__5 I notice that many questions you have asked are simply available through a Google search. You do know about Google ?__label__5 This is a pretty broad question. Can you be more specific, please ? __label__5 We prefer not to just do your homework for you. What answers have you considered ? __label__5 This is a vague question. Do you even consider the payment and billing cycle dates ? __label__5 Why not K & R? Was this just an excuse to bad - mouth some books you didn ' t like ? __label__5 Please stop mentioning my name in relation to FW. <url> How many times do I have to ask ? __label__5 WHy would you need a dummy line to put a breakpoint on ? When can ' t you use an actual line ?__label__5 Do we have an automated - edit - using editor who ' s decided to just stick these in for completeness' sake? Did I miss all this ? __label__5 Deleting Val Klassen ' s page. I redirected it to the creator ' s talkpage, wasn ' t that enough ? __label__5 And what ' s your problem, exactly? What have you tried so far ? __label__5 Ok with you if I play white? I suck so I should go first..and, if you don ' t agree I will crush you like a mag.. whoa power rush.. Anyway ok with you ? __label__5 Just FYI, I have decided to be <url> and remove the screenshot at the top of the article. There is already a link to a mirror of goatse . cx in external links, so why force readers to look at that ? __label__5 is it converted to hex & then the hex is stored as byte array?? but why??__label__5 When you say that the Sharpe ratio is the mean divided by the sample standard deviation.. "Up to a constant factor (sqrt ( n), where n is the number of observations)".. what does this last part mean? Is it really the mean divided by the standard error of the mean ? __label__5 If a main or major purpose of your presence here is to cause drama then I would support your being indefed. Am I misunderstanding something ? __label__5 SO answers homework questions too? Really ? __label__5 Where did you learn English? How come you ' re taking on a third language ? __label__5 Can you clarify what "down" means? Have you turned on the display of error messages to see if anything is generated ? __label__5 You also say that I am participating in a high - tech lynching. Isn ' t that what you did when you put SamuraiClinton on RFA ? __label__5 What do you mean by "how to charge"? Are you asking how much money to charge or how to implement an ad service and payment gateway ? __label__5 why are you using the LET* ? For what ? __label__5 I had no idea that I was such a rogue admin. Are you seriously suggesting that I need to be kicked off the project for closing a deletion debate ? __label__5 Why have you restored this article deleted pursuant to a perfectly acceptable AfD? Am I missing something here ? __label__5 @H . B.: Any chance the `f` was a unicode character instead of a standard f ? __label__5 Wow! Trivial answer converted to comment! Is this new ? __label__5 The article is not about this, at all. Could you explain your logic ? __label__5 .. then you have to at least meet me half - way. For instance, "''<url>'' described the episode as displaying "an exhilarating flair for rapid change of comic gear" and made commented positively on the scene." Can you see the problem here ? __label__5 Bread has *plenty* of water. Do you mean bread *crumbs*, which are typically used in batters ? __label__5 Is there a "trap street" or "Fictitious entry" in it? http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Trap _ street otherwise you can probably get away with violating any copywrite ? __label__5 If you ' re going to accuse me of operating in bad faith, then the discussion has become inappropriately personal. On what grounds do you make such an implication ? __label__5 You can ' t create a geodatabase in ArcMap, unless you are referring to the ArcCatalog window inside of ArcMap. Did you mean a 9 . 3 version of an .MXD file ? __label__5 Also, I seem to be missing that GPS checkbox from the settings interface.. After Review i see Shutter Sound which should be on the next page according to the screenshot above. Any clues ? __label__5 @pimvdb, No I don ' t. Do you have something which could lead me to a solution or just wanna make some pointless comments ? __label__5 @Guffa What exactly should I do to make it absolutely clear that I don ' t care what for my vote is used aside from the fact that it lets the OP know that his / hers way is the best in my opinion? Would you stop making remarks if I upvote your post ? __label__5 Sigh. Did arbcomm teach you nothing ? __label__5 you are not giving us **nearly** enough detail to answer your question. First things first - is this a top down game, isometric, side scrolling ? __label__5 Eh? No, those facts were correct, why do you think they were not ? __label__5 I wasn ' t sure whether you were actually reading anything because facts seem to bounce off of you like bullets off of Superman. And you accuse ''me'' of fantasies ? __label__5 Um. What do you want to replace them with? And, maybe a little context would help, no ? __label__5 What a joke, this player has played league football all his career and some clown has now deleted it off, what kind of rules has this been deleted under then? "May be deleted" seems a bit of a poor excuse to me personally, fancy giving me some information as to why this has been deleted then guys ? __label__5 Updated!! any one??__label__5 1st of all, I think `string` is a reserved word, and shouldn ' t be used. Second of all, have you tried debugging with console . log ? __label__5 Note: Kurt ' s talk page almost certainly isn ' t a good place to seek a broad or unbiased consensus on this question, nor is it the appropriate venue in which to request an exemption from a ban &mdash; and in all honesty, I ' m not sure that managing such an exemption for the purpose of posting gags would be a constructive use of anyone ' s time. Perhaps it would be best to save the jokes for a time when you ' re once again allowed to edit in the WP namespace, or post whatever jokes you wish (within reason) in your own user space ? __label__5 ''SO!?!?'', what has it got to do with you ? __label__5 Major grammar reconstruction from @chills42 and myself. Maybe it ' s a clearer question now ? __label__5 The link here in your question is giving me a database error; did you paste it incorrectly? Also, if you solved it, could you please post your solution here as an answer? :)__label__5 Well, if it isn ' t "ours" to feature, why is it "ours" to use? Do you mean to say that, for you, the best possible encyclopedia would not use images from outside sources, no matter their license ? __label__5 What?! Why did you resolve this without dealing with the User I mentioned ? __label__5 Hey, if you want to assert that a cite does not say what it clearly does say, how about actually coming to the discussion page to discuss it, rather than treating edit summaries like a discussion space? Why the hell am I the one being accused of edit warring, when I ' m the only one actually willing to talk on the discussion page ? __label__5 Maybe I ' m on crack, but in your edit summaries you ' re saying "MT" and "Not MT". What is MT an abbreviation for ? __label__5 You do realise this is complete rubbish - it ' s already been speedily deleted once if you check the logs. I can ' t see any advantage to having this crap floating around for 5 days - can you ? __label__5 what is the problem exactly? you don ' t know how to phrase it so cucumber will understand it ? __label__5 @tinker: In your comment right below the accepted answer you say *@Ivan: nope, adding chomp does not help. tinker 41 mins ago* Do you think this is funny ? __label__5 Seems all too straightforward - I must be missing something. The only 'interesting' part is the talk of 'the reverse side of the page' which seems like a bit of irrelevant misdirection - or not ? __label__5 He probably couldn ' t understand the speedy notice. Then again, who knows what goes on in the minds of n00bs ? __label__5 Wow. You couldn ' t even format your test question correctly? How can we answer your homework for you if you can ' t even format it well ? __label__5 What is unreliable about the newspaper article reports about the protests in Meliti, Lofi, etc? Are you alleging that the protests against the Greek military did not occur ? __label__5 What do you want if you have a path like `images / P / n / ABC - 4b . jpg`? Are you really asking to strip off the path and extension and return only the filename ? __label__5 my iphone 4 ( only one week old, with iOS 4 . 3 installed 5 days ago), HAD custom labels but now doesnt. Did it go away between 4 . 2 and 4 . 3 ??__label__5 @Emil: Do you have a reference? Anything more recent than the ancient (1995) discussion linked in the OP ? __label__5 Are you trying to learn a programming language one whole program at a time? Why don ' t you read the documentation in order to assemble your basic vocabulary ? __label__5 There seems to be a problem when attempting to obtain and parse the list of video devices, the Java engine crashes. What problems did you have with Skype, also iSight related ? __label__5 So.. you want to implement an exclusive decision tree without using if / elif? Why??__label__5 What did they give as the reason they rejected your site? And what did you do to resolve that problem ? __label__5 I ' m not sure I would say either of those phrases as it ' s unclear to me what they would mean, exactly. Could you give a bit more context ? __label__5 Must you go through all of the cities? Must you use all of the tickets ? __label__5 **deletes even so cynical comment**. Can you tell a bit more about the nature of your data and how you want to display it ? __label__5 I clearly provided a source that is valid, and yet a couple of hours is a big deal? Is it your way, or the highway ? __label__5 Are you trying to help him milk the publicity over the WR incident? if it ends up on google with lots of nns why would that matter ? __label__5 That is one loong problem. Can you summarize it ? __label__5 For what purpose? To make the game or to pitch it to an investor ? __label__5 Why do you want to disable either Javascript or cookies, or both? What benefits will that provide ? __label__5 How is it false to state he was the ruler of the PRC - terms such as "Mao ' s government" are used in the article. Can you leave your Marxist personal beliefs at the door ? __label__5 Since your tube station articles don ' t actually contain any information, what is the point of them? Why not put them together and work them into an article that says something interesting ? __label__5 What are they? Where did that offensive photo come from ? __label__5 Anyway why put up with all this carelessness? Why are sockpuppets and trolls being enabled ? __label__5 Sure, we tell you some good ideas, you make mad money. Are we suckers ? __label__5 Seems like the troll committed suicide this morning. I don ' t know why; perhaps not enough fun ? __label__5 This should be the default behavior of a site using OG. Can you provide more details that may help figure out why this isn ' t the case in your configuration ? __label__5 Do you have a specific question? Or just, *"Here ' s my homework, please do it for me?"*__label__5 # And what evidence do you have that I am committing revenge? Revenge for what ? __label__5 This is a fun question. What kind of device are you hacking ? __label__5 There is no answer without a specific question -- how is your code not working? What does the data look like that is being parsed by `split`?__label__5 Unfortunately for those who like railroads, it ' s been closed again! DOn ' t you people have better things to do ? __label__5 How can anyone analyze the page if you keep deleting the content? <url> 01 : 28, 18 December 2006 (UTC) Are you afraid someone might vote for it ? __label__5 I am not sure if I understand, it seems to me that your short answer contradicts your second answer. And, could you please provide an example of how can I use hyperref to do this ? __label__5 Why are you debugging AutoCAD? Isn ' t that AutoDesk ' s job ? __label__5 Why exactly would a space - inefficient trie be too slow? Are you expecting to load more data than available memory and thus creating many page faults ? __label__5 Please name one of those places. This doesn ' t make much sense; how would friction destroy a chemical ? __label__5 You realize the bot maintains a separate page, right? Is it not possible that the "problem" is having the pages inconsistent ? __label__5 Was this wholesale revert really necessary? <url> Did the edit completely fail to improve the article in any way ? __label__5 err.. huh??__label__5 STOP! HAMMERTIME?!__label__5 Self - follow - up: Also, while sometimes the status quo should be maintained, by supporting it in this case, you ' re also supporting a "revert - first, ask questions later" approach to dealing with good faith edits. Is that really what you want ? __label__5 Correcting an article to remove mention of something that ''was made up here in Wikipedia'' and does not exist in any formal definition of the article ' s subject is a furtherance of the <url> policy, not vandalism. Are you interested in knee - jerk reverting, or in actually making your encyclopedia correct and accurate ? __label__5 Hmm.. I suggest you try and solve them yourself, and then post questions back on SO with your attempted solutions. Just asking people to do the work for you kind of defeats the purpose, you know ? __label__5 Um, you know that the last couple of replies have been from someone other than Esprqii? Right ? __label__5 jiewmeng, you should change the question to be more specific. I think the ideal name would be "Why do I need to check if wp _ nonce _ field() exists before using it?"__label__5 While this doesn ' t ring a bell, I find the second paragraph of this question very confusing. Perhaps you could make it a bit clearer ? __label__5 It would help if you described what your ultimate goal is. Do you really expect a given multigigabyte media file to have any resemblance to another multigigabyte media file ? __label__5 You can ' t imagine any circumstance in which you would need a simple front end to enter information into your db? Really ? __label__5 *"I am going to be developing a real - time web application"* - good luck with that! How are you planning to get around the internet latency ? __label__5 Why did you make this community wiki? Why are you refusing to read the documentation ? __label__5 @Francesco: Why are you so against sharing the errors that you are seeing. Why don ' t you get that they are helpful ? __label__5 Are you unable to pee with a half filled bladder??__label__5 Converting <url> to a redirect without preserving either the information or sources, & without discussion was ill - advised. A bit more care in future ? __label__5 Apparently, you correctly answered your own question: The watch window gets the value of a variable by calling its `ToString` method. So, what ' s your *actual* question ? __label__5 OK then. What ' s your problem with putting this in the lead : "is one of the <url> counties of the <url> and " ?__label__5 You have a web service for multiplying numbers? What for ? __label__5 bit or digit? the title of your question says digit, your question says bit, so what is it ? __label__5 No garlic? Are you sure this is a Caesar dressing ? __label__5 homework? or you write software for Somali pirates ? __label__5 Shudder? Why ? __label__5 Stopping code is completely different from debugging code. What ' s the real question ? __label__5 Menu->options->keybindings? Is that not working for some reason ? __label__5 Yep, Google, first hit, then read the paper cited. If you don ' t know what it is, then how come you know you want to implement it ? __label__5 It ' s not a ban, it ' s an indefinite block. He ' ll know about it when he tries to edit and he ' ll know that it was me that blocked him, so what ' s the pint of telling him again on his talk page ? __label__5 Hello -- I see you changed a couple of entries relating to "PALATINE, the Subject Centre for Dance, Drama and Music of the UK Higher Education Academy". I don ' t know (or even care) why that organisation chooses to refer to itself by capitalising the word, but (and I ask for information here) is there a policy that precludes us from respecting that choice ? __label__5 You didn ' t answer the question though - why single speed rather than fixed? What prompted the choice (after 8 years, didn ' t you ever consider the option?)__label__5 Compare the two. How is the first in anyway superior to the second ? __label__5 Stephan, what did you mean by ''"Is English your native language? You seem to fill in a lot of things not said with your assumptions."'' on my talk ? __label__5 I thought that, when some informations are mentioned about in ''desperate housewives'', it is a reliable source? So, in your way of thinking, Susan Mayer maiden name is not Bremmer or something like that ? __label__5 Blocked, templated. Next ? __label__5 You see how time consuming and annoying it is when a person keeps on telling you to provide a source. Why do you want ''Michael'' to be just another compilation album ? __label__5 Hello - some of your writing is a bit hard to understand. Is English your first language, out of curiousity ? __label__5 Of course I am not comparing to anything else. Otherwise, I won ' t be here, right ? __label__5 Wow that is a vaguely described problem. Could you please .. give us some of the code you ' re having issue with ? __label__5 Agian, wishful thinking is one thing, fantasyland, now back to reality, Can you provide me ONE journal, ONE book that mentioned the term "palestinians" before 1960 ' s?? Why not ? __label__5 Well? Shall I request outside assistance ? __label__5 This is incorrect. Have you looked at the article any time after October 2008 ? __label__5 Why not just leave it in the fridge? Do you really need easy quick access to the butter ? __label__5 That ' s a straightforward formula that uses basic arithmetic operations. What part don ' t you understand ? __label__5 How long can it possibly take to copy a ssh key to some remote system? Even over a dial - up line ? __label__5 I ' m a little confused by the title, but I don ' t know much about corn varieties. I know candy corn as [this sweet confection](http://ww . reagantales . com / wp - content / uploads / 2009 / 09 / candycorn1 . jpg); is there a variety of corn that is grown that ' s commonly referred to as candy corn ? __label__5 Still references are quite informative. And nevertheless even if it is discussive and mentions something that is not present in the book it is some kind of a clue, isn ' t it ? __label__5 Nice project. Got any videos or pictures of the output ? __label__5 So this *is* a trick question, right? Or am I just completely useless ? __label__5 I don ' t understand your reference to "Appid". Are you able to clarify a bit more ? __label__5 The name of that site is "CodeKata" not "Code Katas"; "can anyone .." is a yes / no question, what you really want to ask is "what are some more .."; the title "Code Katas" is too short and is automatically rejected by the system; greetings and signatures ("thanks!") are currently considered out of place on SO (see Meta); the [best - practices] tag is out of place, and [coding] (at least [currently](http://stackoverflow . com / questions / tagged / coding)) has lost any specific meaning (effectively all programming involves "coding", right?).__label__5 This is an awesome question. I think the question should be, "How do I import the [Geonames list for India (ID . zip)](http://download . geonames . org / export / dump/) as taxonomy terms so it works with Hierarchical Select?"__label__5 You might want to add some comments on what you mean by early game as this term is often confusing and interpreted differently. For example, at about what supply are you expecting the Marauder push ? __label__5 last msg ??__label__5 Seriously, have you tried Googling for "home automation"?__label__5 did you read the "permission denied" message in that trace? why are you swallowing exceptions (`catch ( TwitterException te) {}`)?__label__5 Hey, could you please tell me: if I decide to use Amazon CloudFront, what is the URL of my images going to be like? ww . mydomain . com / image . gif or an Amazon CDN domain like ww . ama - cdn . com/.. (or whatever domains Amazon uses)?__label__5 Why -1? what wrong with ppl here ? __label__5 What do you mean "personal attack"? Why don ' t site what my "personal attack" is ? __label__5 Right, but not all of it. So can you retrieve it or not ? __label__5 So you see KV, just in case you missed the point, you are in the naughty chair in the naughty corner because of your own baloney, baloney that you bring yourself. Now, didn ' t you like that story ? __label__5 you asked this same question a couple days ago http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 3595256 / simple - pseudocode - code - question . Did you not like the answers you got ? __label__5 As a former administrator, and therefore a veteran editor who knows how wikipedia really works, I am actually surprised you would even ask such a question with such an obvious answer. I suspect you were simply pointing out a perceived injustice with a question founded in a <url> that you yourself did not take seriously ? __label__5 Ridding the project from copyvio images, which could result in expensive legal battles and put the whole project at risk? You think that we should risk putting the work of thousands of editors to risk because of some image ? __label__5 You just did! What are you asking that your query doesnt already do ? __label__5 You seem to have an agenda of denying that some of the ancients were pedophiles. Why ? __label__5 Why tag for deletion? It was obviously a new user ' s attempt at creating a disambiguation page, why not clean it up ? __label__5 Are you using GRUB2 or GRUB Legacy?. Can you post your grub config files ? __label__5 I wonder what difference it will make to your prompt? A few milliseconds cannot cause problems, can they ? __label__5 Jeez, Joe, and I was going to suggest you hang around Andrea ' s to make sure he doesn ' t do himself a disservice.. What is this? Getting blocked is the new cool ? __label__5 This makes no sense. Did you mean "space complexity of O ( n2)"?__label__5 I started thinking of how to copy - edit it, but then lost interest.. what is this thing that Americans have about writing about their bloody roads, for goodness sake? Can you imagine the <url> as a featured article, or having a "List of A - roads in Gloucestershire" as a featured list ? __label__5 Your shortcode definition is `frame _ left`, code examples use `frame _ right`. Can I assume you have `frame _ right` shortcode defined in same way ? __label__5 The insertion of data into the hash seems to have nothing to do with your original creation of the hash. Why are you so reluctant to show us your code ? __label__5 What in the world are you talking about? Is this a legal question (use of copyrighted images)?__label__5 Hello, Vladimir Alexiev; welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which Drupal version are you interested ? __label__5 Do you understand now what was wrong with your edits? What do you intend to do if unblocked ? __label__5 what exactly are you expecting to see? more than 1 server ? __label__5 Bingo! Since you ' ve seen the light, now will you stop trying to craft PR statements ? __label__5 Sorry I should have asked it in more accurate words..yes I meant that it should be measured with respect to the aircraft ' s instantaneous position and not velocity.. Would the cross - track wind measurement / direction change if it was measured with respect to the aircraft ' s 'airspeed' velocity than 'groundspeed' velocity? -- as the cross - track direction is effectively perpendicular to the instantanous velocity of the aircraft -- whether measured wrt to ground or air -- so its measurement / direction would not be infulenced by the aircraft ' s velocity.. no ? __label__5 It was closed as "no consensus, default to keep". What difference does it make ? __label__5 Why do you have this user name??__label__5 Hmm. You ''do'' realize that two of the "please sign" diffs are from <url>, and that the talk page is splashed with <person> which has the sig thingy ?
