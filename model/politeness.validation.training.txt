__label__0 Hi old friend! Would you mind unprotecting my user / talkpages please ? __label__0 I think it would be excellent if you could give more detail (see suncoolsu ' s answer). Furthermore, with design, do you mean how to analyze the data ? __label__0 Ahh.. My apologies. You wouldn ' t be using the google toolbar perchance ? __label__0 Yes, this is a nice illustration. I ' d love to have a look of the code; is it possible for you to mail it to me ? __label__0 @hade @Dogbert I have updated the original post. Is this helpful information ? __label__0 Thanks for putting the igneous rock template on all of those articles - it looks really useful! Do you think it should have an ultramafic section added ? __label__0 Could you please describe in more detail what do you mean? Perhaps include a drawing ? __label__0 Hey, several of the footnotes that you use in <url> are Harvard footnotes, which means that they need the full citation of the books in works cited section. I imagine you grabbed some of that information from some other places, would you mind retriveing the bibliographic data ? __label__0 @cjm: Good point. Are you creating this PDF yourself, or is it from some 3rd party ? __label__0 the ability to read and write in Korean. (including in the source) So are you writing this from scratch or modifying an existing one ? __label__0 http://search . cpan . org/~rgarcia / perl - 5 . 10 . 0 - RC2 / pod / perlcall . pod # G _ KEEPERR explains the `'(in cleanup)'` mechanism, http://cpansearch . perl . org / src / JESSE / perl - 5 . 12 . 2 / ext / XS - APItest / t / call . t shows using it. this is all XS related, but maybe it will help point you or someone else to a pure perl answer ? __label__0 Thanks for the info, this is enlightening. A followup question - with panniers do you find it necessary to use a pair with the content ' s weight somewhat balanced between the sides ? __label__0 Hi, I understand that the WP : COI rules would still apply, regardless of username. Could you kindly approve the change in my user name from cecn to funshine ? __label__0 The way I ' m reading it back via glReadPixels ; however, I may be doing this wrong. What is the correct way to do this ? __label__0 I ' m not familiar with that article. Can you please specify the exact article title ? __label__0 What ' s the problem with Gmail about privacy? The only issue I saw recently was Google Buzz but I ' m not sure that affected the Google Apps accounts, did it ? __label__0 Dude, awesome planning. Also, since there ' s at least two ways to do pretty much anything, how would you know if they are right or not ? __label__0 I agree, how did you come up with the problem in the first place? I would have thought the idea for a thesis would have come from a real world problem that needs solving ? __label__0 Congrats! I thought you were going to be away today ? __label__0 Interesting problem. What have you tried so far, and where are you stuck ? __label__0 Hey just wanted to say thanks for giving me the Autopatrolled thing! Just curious though, what did I do to get it ? __label__0 I am happy to rewrite it but please explain to me how it is any different from the Warrior Lacrosse and STX pages? They don ' t have any links except to their own websites ? __label__0 Thank you. Was it anything in particular ? __label__0 Thank you for the tip Javier. As I ' ve never done a FL before, can you take a look after I ' ve completed the list ? __label__0 Thanks for the help! That info should be on <url> in easy to read form, no ? __label__0 Seeing you back on Wikipedia after a long time. How are you doing, and is everyone you know safe ? __label__0 putting the keyword (with special character) in quotes does not work. is there any other methods ? __label__0 I just tried this bc I was thinking along the same lines but for some reason when I implement with my data1 . csv file it makes no difference, I think it is because of userID numbering and lettering. Is possible for me to send you the data file, so you can see what I mean ? __label__0 Thank you for your answer. What are the sources for region 4 (Australia) release dates ? __label__0 I ' ll add that to the others. Will that work ? __label__0 Sure. Can you describe such a enumeration? :)__label__0 Sure, no problem. Jestes z Warszawy ? __label__0 ..welcome back! Is this permanent, or are you just passing through ? __label__0 Hey, I found <url> and at around 1 : 10, I think I can see the Backstreet Boys holding platinum discs (or double platinum, I ' m not sure) for Backstreet ' s Back and Millennium. Can you please verify and is it possible to use this as a source for adding South African certifications ? __label__0 You ' re welcome. And now, could you give a more detailed description of the problem ? __label__0 I think that ' s a good solution. Should we give it a try ? __label__0 That code looks good. What isn ' t it doing that you want it to ? __label__0 Hello, I am interested in helping out with <url> and <url>, but the pages are very very long, which is unmanageable and discouraging. Could you please break them up into (many) smaller subpages ? __label__0 Sorry if it seems like I ' m bugging you about the above image - I ' m trying to determine the copyright holder, which needs to be specified on the image page per <url>a. When I click on the source link, I get an "access forbidden" message. Can you please specify the copyright holder on the page ? __label__0 Thanks for your input. Would you mind voicing your opinion in the GMC ' s talk page ? __label__0 You come across as a contributor who possess great depth. Are you a history professor/ student ? __label__0 Hello Erin, and welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which Drupal version are you interested ? __label__0 Thanks for the infomative reply -- I wasn ' t really questioning your putting the image in the infobox; appearance - wise I don ' t think it makes much difference. It is better, though, I think, to have the thumbnail indicator -- Is it possible to have that inside the infobox ? __label__0 Yes I am planning to. Is that good ? __label__0 I ' d be happy to help but I don ' t speak Ukrainian. What do you need help with ? __label__0 Thanks--can you add the romanization of the Arabic at <url> too? Is it ''jibna baladi''?__label__0 Yes, that is the real source code. And the compilation has been performed without optimization, perhaps that is the reason ? __label__0 Do the writers of the GRE write illogical yet grammatical sentences like this to intentionally trip people up? Or do they really think this way ? __label__0 I was wondering if you ' d like me to make your userboxes (on your userpage) line up horizontally (in columns of 3) rather than vertically. Interested ? __label__0 good question. Is the JVM open source (hotspot) or are the cools such as the javac compiler open source as well ? __label__0 @cb Please note that some angles are not cyclic: the approach angle in the original question is a good example. If you have a specific follow - up question, why not post it ? __label__0 Forgive me if you ' ve already done this, but..Could you post a list of the listing codes (such as DO, RN, etc.) for possibly non - listed properties with reference numbers ? __label__0 Thank you, after some experimenting, this seems to be the way to go. Any thoughts on how to move the reparented component back to its original place in DOM (and ExtJS component hierarchy) once the window is closed ? __label__0 Internet Explorer may cause that. Can you check IE permissions please ? __label__0 Please can you show the exact code that fails, for example, if this is in a view, paste in the relevant part. Is it "<%= sanitized _ text ( truncate ( msword _ text)) %>" that fails and "<%= sanitized _ text ( msword _ text) %> that is okay ? __label__0 Please provide code and a specific question. What have you tried ? __label__0 @robertc - thanks for the reply. I don ' t know how to answer your question - what should I look for ? __label__0 @zildjohn01, What ' s the best way to do this (which PHP functions?). Could you leave a detailed answer with your approach ? __label__0 Is there any real world current sources? How can I implement a current source from a voltage source ? __label__0 You say you don ' t want multisite, and then when someone mentions multisite you say it ' s a good idea? "Different pages with different things on them".. is this a joke question ? __label__0 @user5402 could you please elaborate? What does opening the pipe do ? __label__0 Thanks for the articles on South African cricket teams - I was planning to do them myself but I really appreciate that you ' ve done them. By the way, where did you find the information on what regions the teams represent ? __label__0 I ' m sorry, but I do feel that this is *way* off - topic for a [programming / scripting website](http://stackoverflow . com / faq/). Perhaps [Super User](http://superuser . com/) might be a better fit; or [Doctype](http://doctype . com/)?__label__0 Well, solution non - withstanding, the news - story you linked to was great read. Some people, huh? :)__label__0 I ' m an admin, I ' d be happy to do it. You want me to do it now ? __label__0 Thanks for help! One more question: similar item at this address is a painting: http://sflib1 . sfpl . org : 82 / record=b1035824~S0 Do I use the same tags ? __label__0 Thanks. BTW, should I mince the parsley before frying it ? __label__0 I don ' t know of a specific resource, but if you have specific questions I may be able to help a little. Are you using WER ? __label__0 Yeah, it ' s difficult to tell what the columns mean from their names. Can you add more explanation of how the tables fit together ? __label__0 Crimson, there is a discussion at <url> where we have implemented a new template for bot operators when their bot is blocked stating that it is in ''no way'' an indication or accusation of wrong doing on the operator ' s behalf. I ' m sorry you have interpreted that way - would you be willing to re - consider your retirement ? __label__0 Hey Sai - I ' m having trouble picturing it my head. Any chance you have a design or a sketch for it ? __label__0 My first impression is that it is indeed with the StackPanel, since it ' s default is to "shrink" around elements. Have you tried using a fixed size container and adjusting the width, if needed, as part of the animation ? __label__0 Do you think the term standard means this is THE standard today ? Isn ' t it like asking why principal component are "principal" and not secondary ?__label__0 Its related to an algorithm for finding unique sets of a given number of items, so I just wanted to know if that had a name or if I was already looking at it. Is my question still off topic ? __label__0 Martin, sorry to disturb you, but you said that Kelson is making the new ZIM file, where is the location of that file? Does it also reside at <url>?__label__0 Nice work on <url> - I had been a bit hesitant to put in those other reports, but now it looks great. How did you find out that I created it ? __label__0 Happy belated birthday to you too! How have you been ? __label__0 The block seems to no longer be necessary or productive. If I were to bring a motion to get them unblocked, would you support it ? __label__0 If you only want a finite number N of oracles, you could define an N - in - 1 compound oracle by using the first log ( N) bits of the compound oracle to indicate which suboracle you wish to query. Am I missing something ? __label__0 Thanks for the alert. By the way, how ' s Granny doing ? __label__0 Hi, thanks for your help. There is also this sentence "Asukkaista 84 , 5% oli ruotsinkielisixe4 ja 15 , 4% suomenkielisixe4 vuonna 1970 ja kunta oli kaksikielinen." What does it mean, please ? __label__0 please clarify the scenario please. What exactly is the purpose of finding out ? __label__0 FYI, I found a unit representative, I think, see <url>. I directed him to your draft for the military reps, would you mind supporting him if you need, I am kindof wrapped up in several different things off wiki and on ? __label__0 Thanks! There is yet another at <url>; would you agree it should be closed the same as the others ? __label__0 Thanks for the detailed reply. Can a random admin who notices the image with the speedy tag do something useful to fix the situation ? __label__0 Which would be a good addition: "I just did the problem and thought it ' s an interesting question. What are your thoughts / ideas on this?"__label__0 Is there any consensus for these changes? If I ' ve missed the discussion, I do apologise, but could you post me a link to where it occurred ? __label__0 I see you ' ve done a lot of work on hospital - related articles, especially in Oregon. Perhaps you ' d like to join us in improving the articles for hospitals in Oregon ? __label__0 Are you open to programmatic solutions (e . g. custom renderers), or solely OOTB methods ? __label__0 Nice work! Since you dug up some information on Fahnbulleh, I ' m curious u2014 do you know what relation he is to Ambassador Henry Fahnbulleh, whom Tubman accused of an attempted coup ? __label__0 So how on earth do I overwrite the existing files without deleting all of the custom content? (CSS, markup, etc?)__label__0 Thank you for caring re: my loss. We go on, because it ' s all we can ever do, y ' know ? __label__0 You added the tag [approximation - hardness]. Can you elaborate on how this question is related to hardness of approximation, preferably in the question ? __label__0 @George, will this work in Fedora 15 under the new Gnome 3? Is it in the repositories ? __label__0 The Smalltalk one? The CLOS one ? __label__0 I ' m having a little trouble following your description; do you want an algorithm to find graph automorphisms? Or one to test whether a given permutation is an automorphism ? __label__0 Generally, I ' d anticipate a code bug. Can you paste in your FD _ SET and your select calls please ? __label__0 Thank you so much! I hope it ' s allright if I move it to my front page, at least when the talk has to be archived ? __label__0 I am using the 3 . x Python version. I figured that since I am new to the language, I should try to learn the newest version - is that faulty logic ? __label__0 On the WP : Football discussion you mentioned that Man City had 150 , 00+ views more than the seasons article. Please could you tell me where I can find page - views for wiki articles ? __label__0 Thanks Cameron. That makes sense, but then why isn ' t this access restricted to only copy constructors and assignment operators ? __label__0 I ' ve never heard that. Any links to horror stories ? __label__0 Thank you very much for your comment! Could you help to mention an example of debugger helper ? __label__0 bring what back? how are bluetooth and killing processes related ? __label__0 @bvr @chambwez I think my code is working fine now :) My last question would be, is session handling possible in XMLRPC? How do I maintain a stateful transmission between the client and the server ? __label__0 Thank you for closing out this debate. Can you please restore the history for GFDL purposes ? __label__0 Many thanks. I can ' t resolve "The work represents a summary of themes explored in Bacon ' s previous paintings", Tony ' s right - its clunky and unclear; any ideas ? __label__0 Well, the title may say it all but _"all"_ isn ' t enough for me to understand what you are asking. Can you please elaborate ? __label__0 I was at the library today looking through the back issues of ''Mojo'' and found a career - spanning Chili Peppers article from 2004. I read most of it, but I can go back next week and cite from it. Is there anything you want me to look for ? __label__0 @user052211 Glad to hear you got it sorted out. Would you mind posting your solution as an answer so that other developers can reference it if they run into a similar problem ? __label__0 I ' ve finished with that category, yes. Would you like a hand clearing it ? __label__0 Thanks for your work in cleaning up <url> (which is now finished, but for a few hard cases which likely will require the writing of articles to conform to those links). Would you like to collaborate on another section of this list ? __label__0 The project page you linked provides a fairly specific overview of what the module does. Do you have specific questions about why a module would depend on it other than what they lay out there ? __label__0 Could you do me a huge favour, but only if you want to, because I know it ' s a lot to ask. Could you do the Peer Review for ''Loud'' by any chance ? __label__0 I ' ve seen this happen when my application crashes. If you run your app without breakpoints, do you experience a crash ? __label__0 You ' ve contributed a lot to Puget Sound area articles. Would you be willing to take a look at the debate I ' m having at <url> and do whatever you think is best ? __label__0 Eh. Fresh pasta takes less than 3 minutes to cook in boiling water. Why would you need to microwave this ? __label__0 I ' d be happy to. Can you tell me how ? __label__0 Thanks a lot steve, I ' m trying to implement the pseudo - code line by line very carefully, there is an extended pseudo - code that ' s written more clearly here: http://ww . wpi . edu / Pubs / ETD / Available / etd - 0430102 - 11906 / unrestricted / corourke . pdf on page 27, I ' m coding that carefully and i ' m testing it with some sample answers given by NTRU, I think i ' m also getting held back in understanding the pseudo - code, in my code I gave a fixed length and set of values to the polynomial f, and the infinite loop on 8 - 31 never ended, thanks for pointing out that f is a variable. Any more tricks to watch out for ? __label__0 I guess you could have mis - typed the name of the textbox control. Is it TextBox1? :)__label__0 Noticed you ' ve been holding the fort alone.. again :) Thought I ' d drop by and say hello. Surely your sanity has reached its limits by now ? __label__0 Thank you for taking the time to dig up the references. Are you planning on integrating them into the article sometime soon ? __label__0 Hi, I think that the best algorithm depends on the number of the teams. How many should they be ? __label__0 Depending on the CUDA version you are using, device emulation may not be available, as it has been deprecated and possibly removed. Is it feasible to get another GPU (a cheap one for display maybe)?__label__0 Hello Jeffq, I noticed you revert vandalism occasionally. Would you like me to grant your account <url> to help you revert vandalism more easily ? __label__0 Looks like you ' re off to a good start. What problem are you having ? __label__0 Seems very similar to http://security . stackexchange . com / questions / 1634 / which - instant - messaging - services - use - or - allow - secure - protocols - and - what - do - those - but there may be a slightly different goal here. @LanceBaynes - Could you elaborate a bit, particularly in a way that distinguishes this question from the other ? __label__0 Hey, thanks for your contributions here :). Would you mind referencing them to conform with wiki - policy ? __label__0 @MitMaro Thanks. Could you please do the math of whether it ' s useful or not? :)__label__0  ( undent) Your Chinese is much better than mine. Is it possible in Chinese to omit a conjunction such as u548c or u8ddf and let a string of two successive nouns refer to a set of two objects ? __label__0 Hi, I ' d like to help you with the image you just uploaded to the <url> article. Can you tell me where you found it ? __label__0 I don ' t think this is possible as written. When N is very large, the expected product of widely separated xi must be very close to zero, and we can find a set of 1 / p + 1 that must essentially be mutually exclusive despite all having probability p. Perhaps you meant E [ xi xj] - p^2 = .. ?__label__0 i didn ' t think to look for the borders, it ' s a nice idea. but how can i distinguish between other borders that the image contains ? __label__0 Thanks for clarifying the article - it looks much better now. By the way, is it just me, or does the Trisakti look a bit like the Flag of the Philippines ? __label__0 how you show imges from lazyload in listview ' s image ? can you post your code please ?__label__0 hey @yoda .thnks fr helping me out!..can u please post the above comment in my question as edit ..? it says i cant as am not allowed 2 post imagess ??__label__0 Do you still take photos in Jefferson Parish? If so, would it be alright if I posted some photo requests of some parish high schools ? __label__0 Pathauto is able to handle that. Have you tried it ?__label__0 i - o inversion is not equivalent if they assume an external magnetic field to be present. Is that the case ? __label__0 Number of articles on South Slavic languages is now pretty high and I ' d like to add ''Category : South Slavic languages'' as subcategory to ''Category : Slavic languages'', possibly with subcategories on individual languages. The catch is, I don ' t know how :-) -- could you point me to relevant Wiki links or start the job yourself and let me finish it ? __label__0 Please describe, what happens if you try to boot. What boot options are used ? __label__0 @Micheal- Thanks . Could you please elaborate on how I could set this up ? __label__0 I am looking for help improving the dermatology content on wikipedia. Would you be willing to help, or do you have any friends interested in derm that would be interested in helping ? __label__0 Hi David, you ' re good with images. Anything you can do to clean up <url> so it ' s useful on ITN ? __label__0 Thanks. And, what about the <url> about "he drowned" not being reflexive in Spanish ? __label__0 Thanks for that, hopefully I have input this correctly. This page also seems to be flagged due to several issues, surely these can now be removed as the page has proved its worth as much as pages like <url> have ? __label__0 I ' m sure also. Would you show me a better way to do this ? __label__0 I have seen 'webform - revisions' module, but it solves nothing to me. Have you got that functionality working ? __label__1 Respectfully, you ' ve replied to the message below mine a day ago now. Could you provide guidance for my request please ? __label__1 Completely different approach - could you OCR the page, and see if it comes up with any characters? Or are you working from scratch and / or prefiltering the pages quickly before they even reach a much slower OCR step, and / or dealing with pages that might have illustrations but no text ? __label__1 I say - are you a sort of picture finder? You couldn ' t find one of John Bowlby could you ? __label__1 Ditto "look professional". What does that mean to you, exactly ? __label__1 Wanted to Email you about Wikimedia Converence Netherlands, but your email is not working. In any case, you could crash at our place ? __label__1 Is it acceptable to build an auxiliary data structure to guide the decision process? Could that data structure have size O ( n) of the original list ? __label__1 sorry folks, i didn ' t know how to use the community wiki box. can this be reopened as i ' ve moved it over ? __label__1 What do you mean by "like this"? And for what exactly are you asking a rationale ? __label__1 Spec isn ' t complete, what format is the percentage entered? What should happen if the user enters in decimal format (0 . 15) or includes the % symbol in the text, or worse yet both ? __label__1 ..? Can you please be more specific about your question? You talk about Samsung graphic customizations ? __label__1 Thanks for your help with <url>. I ' ve responded to your comments - could you please take a look and let me know if you are content now ? __label__1 Wonderful! :) Do you particularly like to work on comics creators' articles ? __label__1 How large is your triangle likely to be? Is it small enough to assume that the surface can be considered as flat or do you need spherical geometry ? __label__1 What approaches did you try? What were the problems ? __label__1 I think if we did it that way, it would add a lot of possibilities to the page, enabling us to give breakdowns of other wars and major events in separate tables as well, in addition to alternative listings, which I think would be quite useful. Because there are a lot of events with different aspects to them that could be covered in more detail IMO, what do you think ? __label__1 @Mark, i . e. a perfect question for this StackExchange eh ? __label__1 Jason, how do you view your phone call to tlc ' s father & pastor in the light of the Biblical conflict resolution process? And in the light of the Wikipedian conflict resolution process ? __label__1 It ' s not clear what you ' re trying to do here. Do you want the view to render the string "1 image more than 1 image .. "?__label__1 This is likely to be a shell misconfiguration, probably the lack of prompt protection [suggested by mikel](http://unix . stackexchange . com / questions / 6580 / why - is - gnu - screen - byobu - leaving - garbage - text - in - the - shell - during - a - reverse - sear / 6581 # 6581). What shell are you using (probably bash, but please confirm)?__label__1 Could you possibly expand on the difference between fluorescent and reflective clothing? Until now, I would have thought they were more or less the same. Is it simply a matter of the degree of reflectivity ? __label__1 Don ' t let that link get to the agile evangelists, they will ROTFLOL in the best Weird Al style. You put a ton of work in a feature and only after its almost DONE you get feedback from the primary consumer, guess what happened ? __label__1 http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Comparison _ of _ revision _ control _ software is a great comparison table for exactly this. Discussion question.. community wiki ?__label__1 Out of curiosity what are you testing? How are things going ? __label__1 A query walks into a bar, up to two tables and says, 'Can I join you?'. Are homework questions allowed ? __label__1 You can create an empty div and when the larger image is clicked you can replace that div with a SWF (hiding images if necessary). Will that be OK ? __label__1 @conmulligan thanks for the heads up are there any plans to let people login ? slos I noticed that when i searched a tag and and selected it i got old topics that had new answers first rather than just the newest topics is that intentional ?__label__1 Your question is not clear. Could you please edit the text and add a bit more context ? __label__1 How do you reference an image from CSS? Other than `background - image`?__label__1 I haven ' t heard from you in sometime. Como estan las cosas ? __label__1 I could take a peek, at least. What problems are you having ? __label__1 OK I ' ve created the following test page: <url>. Tell me if you have a problem with it ? __label__1 Do you think your question has not been answered adequately yet? If so, how can the answers be improved upon ? __label__1 Hello. Do you know if / how coat of arms from councils abolished in 2009 can be licensed ? __label__1 In the bike lane, obviously. What ' re they gonna do ? __label__1 Hi I saw that you make maps and plans. Could you make me some that good plans, of station ? __label__1 I wonder if it would ever be worth doing an article on G & S scholarship? You know, cover the major discoveries, describe the evolution of the field.. or is that too likely to hit problems ? __label__1 Fixed it for you. BTW, `apn _ config` is a `std::vector`, right ? __label__1 Does the word need to be composed of words of the dictionary only? For example, what would be the result for *applepie* if *apple* is not in the dictionary ? __label__1 Does saying `/bin / sh -l` fix it? If not, what about switching to another shell, like `tcsh -l`?__label__1 This has since been part of the site. Is it still useful ? __label__1 Sorry, I ' ve moved a number of articles and thought I did it correctly. How is moving done properly without losing the edit history ? __label__1 I have to say that I don ' t like the output, harder to read and code isn ' t formatted with the correct colors. Could there be an optional output for how it is printed ? __label__1 Are you unable to change it back? Or are you just curious as to how it got changed ? __label__1 I don ' t own any from Rousseau either, but I did know it was Grand Cru, just made a mistake! I notice above you and Stefan discussing the Langton ' s Classification Wines, I ' m going to have a go at getting articles made for more of the exceptional level producers, I ' ve just finished one on <url> - are you interested in working on any of them together ? __label__1 sorry, yeah, that ' s what my file looks like. Well, the '& ~' isn ' t indented, but that doesnt matter right ? __label__1 I noticed your edits and the VfD discussion on the topic. Are you on facebook ? __label__1 Don ' t forget to test this case: `test . sh -a -b 'c d' -c`. You don ' t want the "c d" to come out "d c" (but do you want "-c -b 'c d' -a" or "-c 'c d' -b -a"?).__label__1 Can it be expanded beyond a definition? Can you write something about who coined it, references to its usage in popular culture, things of those sorts ? __label__1 I am contemplating a larger article on this very interesting topic. Thoughts ? __label__1 Please be a little more clear? do you have the printer attached to the ubuntu machine or the Windows XP machine ? __label__1 Probably I would have to do quite a bit of alteration in wording. Is that O . K ? __label__1 Can you clarify the question, please? Is it that you have an account with Last . fm, but not a paying account ? __label__1 It ' s kind of hard to understand what you are asking. Maybe you could clarify it a little bit ? __label__1 It looks pretty good to me. Can you give some idea of why you think it ' s incorrect ? __label__1 I take it you only have to have pieces at the corners of the square to win, and you can ' t move on a space where your opponent has already moved? Does the square have to be aligned with the axes, or does a square tilted 45 degrees win the game ? __label__1 My bot finally got past the connection errors I ' ve been getting and spit out the largest 4 , 00 articles in sorted order for this. Would you like to take a short break while I replace the first page with them and manually mark all of the already - checked ones as done ? __label__1 Dan, can you take a look at the last exchange regarding the 1952 election? Looking at the citations, is there doubt in your mind that there was a deal, or at least that it has been widely suggested by reliable sources that there was a deal ? __label__1 Just an FYI, I replied at FPOC. How many lists would you prefer ? __label__1 I note that you ' ve edited since this was brought up here. Could you please respond ? __label__1 Thanks. The wall is 10 1 / 2 feet wide. Also, how much excess carpet should I leave in order to have enough to tuck it between the tack strip and baseboard ? __label__1 Ok, then your own code seems cleanest. And although this is offtopic: how did you generate those images? :)__label__1 Thanks; it just occurred to me to cite USGS maps, but this is maybe even better. Was there once an airplane crash in the vicinity, or are there maps like this for all parts of the country ? __label__1 I agree. How about using Mizbot ? __label__1 Can you give us a simple, dummy example to explain what you ' re trying to do? eg give us an example of a batch of the kind of repeated text / html you ' d hope the code would catch ? __label__1 Hi- The Magnificent Clean - keeper- I note that you recently removed a contribution I made to the <url> page, citing lack of "notability" as the reason. Iu2019m not saying you where wrong to do so (notability is an important criteria in the Wiki project), however, since the definition of "notability" is hard to pin down, could we discuss this particular instance, in greater detail, at some point ? __label__1 Oh, and since this is a story - telling kind of topic, shouldn ' t this be CW?

Your thoughts on the most recent commentary ? __label__1 What ' s the class that it can ' t find? Are they all custom classes ? __label__1 @Herbert: Still I think your answer is very confusing.

Have you ever seen this done for real ? __label__1 I seem to have stuffed up creating 4 April 2009 very badly. Can you help ? __label__1 `lte IE 8` means "less than equal IE 8" so this seems to work as designed. Can you clarify what the problem is ? __label__1 Great! Do you use IRC at all, or do you stay on - wiki ? __label__1 I ' m sorry, but your example only makes me more confused. Why don ' t you first put the first `r` into the first container, the second `b` into the second container, and the next two `r` into the first container, getting the sum of `0`?__label__1 This question really doesn ' t satisfy the guidelines of the site.

Has the image been listed for deletion on commons, or should I do so ? __label__1 @hakre: I don ' t agree with the tag you added, `[work - for - free - for - me]`.

Is this a follow up of a similar question ? __label__1 I restored the lead picture series I like. What do you think ? __label__1 Sounds good then.

Are you just asking how to invoke an instance ' s methods ? __label__1 It is disputed among admins regarding the protection of userpages, although the policy says that users can have their user / user sub - pages (but not the talks) semi - protected if the user requests it. Are there other subpages of yours that you ' d like protecting ? __label__1 I haven ' t used those features much yet; can you explain what effect you ' d like them to have on your blog?

If you Select All in the pdf, do you see the outline of the image ? __label__1 What programming language does this regard? Could you elaborate on "Get the same parts between"?__label__1 I actually went to the long term abuse page right now, and tried to block them, but it seems that those accounts don ' t exist. Have they been listed incorrectly ? __label__1 Hi again, OK, say we don ' t go along the lines of Blair will go before the end of 2007; but we list the announced candidates for when Blair does resign (which will inevitably happen at some point). Do you think this would be any better / more suitable ? __label__1 No worries. So back to my question: what software makes them rock like that ? __label__1 Can you provide a simple test file (with valid referenced SVG) showing this problem? Have you considered fetching the SVG source and [appending that document to the page](http://groups . google . com / group / svg - web / browse _ thread / thread / 363d599b7eb5a517) instead of as a referenced element ? __label__1 D - Wave!

Maybe he is known ? __label__1 good idea. you have to chop them, right ? __label__1 <url> and I was wondering if you have worked on that project at all recently, or whether you know of any other open - source projects that implement your idea. Also, do you have any Wikibooks that you ' ve written ? __label__1 I think a bot could come along later and remove those double returns. Is there a way of coding a space into the template itself ? __label__1 Hullo. How goes it ? __label__1 I just tried using your code verbatim and it ' s working correctly for me (label is correctly centered in view). Perhaps something else is interfering with it ? __label__1 Call me a little dense. Do you mean there has to be the same number of Songs, articles, albums, and bio ' s on the portal for the portal to work ? __label__1 Can I you take a look at <url> and <url>? Specifically, look at the formatting of the general reference; is it an acceptable way to present the references ? __label__1 To clarify - the retain count is 1 after initWithNibName and 4 after pushViewController.. Any ideas ? __label__1 Hi Cm, I noticed your edits with the edit summary "unicodify" when removing mdash and ndash. Are you sure this is correct and are you preserving the n / m distinction ? __label__1 I ' ve been going through <url> and replacing the FiveHorizons . com refs (per Quadzilla99 ' s comments). However, refs 39 and 40 don ' t seem to appear anywhere else; could you perhaps replace them with more reliable sources if you get the chance ? __label__1 BTW, I translated the page to the best of my ability (my Spanish only carried me so far). Do you speak Portuguese ? __label__1 It ' s not exactly clear what you ' re trying to do. Do you just want get the text of the HTML table without the HTML tags ? __label__1 Yes. Need help ? __label__1 Saw your edits on <url> - all good - but I have a question. What does "collapse <url>" mean in your edit summary ? __label__1 interesting, i have used my google apps as the email to chat for some time and never had any problem connecting to other users. Could you describe the issue you are seeing ? __label__1 Would it be possible for you to expand / clarify your question? Perhaps word it differently ? __label__1 Why must you sell the studded tires? Can ' t you just throw them in a closet during the summer, then remount them when winter rolls around ? __label__1 seems like gettimeofday issue on linux. maybe your kernel has some extra configurations for timer ? __label__1 I ' m not finding the name change request at <url>, nor does there appear to be such an edit under the "Rogerboas" account name. Did you posti t while logged out, perhaps ? __label__1 Does this happen in one kind of debugging session, or is it random. For example, if you are trying to debug a running service by attaching to process, or are you just trying to run code in the debugger ? __label__1 Thanks for telling me. Do you just perform the rename, and I then re - create the account to take it for myself ? __label__1 It ' s weird that this doesn ' t work on Python 3 . 1, could you share more about your directory structure and module organization?

Do these subdivisions make sense ? __label__1 Hi! Could you consider speedy deleting <url>?__label__1 Well, the problem you linked to is entirely different than what you ' re describing. Can you please decide on which one you need help with ? __label__1 In <url>, you removed a cartoon image of Wendy Thomas that had been used in the infobox on her article. I ' m not very familiar with the NFCC policy you cite, so I was wondering if you thought that giving a rationale on the image for use in that particular article would bring it up to specs ? __label__1 Quite welcome. Doesn ' t Huggle use rollback when available and applicable (last several edits were by the same user)?__label__1 The Birr page looks good now.. but, it seems a little strange to make a distinction between Abyssinia and Ethiopia, as if they were two different entities. The native name was ''ityoppya'' (Ethiopia) long before 1931; in that year, the Emperor formally requested the international community to begin using Ethiopia instead of Abyssinia, much as the Shah, around the same time, requested the use of "Iran" instead of "Persia" for his country (and it was also around this time that Siam became Thailand, I believe..) Anyway, it might make more sense for one box reading "Abyssinia / Ethiopia" in place of the two separate boxes..?__label__1 Hi, I have cleaned up this page and, in the AfD, identified many other sources and additional content. I wonder if you would reconsider your delete !vote please (I will do the necessary expansion as and when there is a reasonable expectation of it being kept)?__label__1 I believe your question could have some validity, can you please elaborate on the scope of your question. Are you speaking in reference to the exchange of electrons or are you speaking in more of a supernatural aspect ? __label__1 sorry, i ' m not able to comprehend that? Where is the "add folder" option in the places menu ? __label__1 Despite my best efforts, I ' ve been unable to find the coordinates for the <url>: it ' s a specific little spot somewhere on a rail line between two villages, 3 miles apart. Is the "coord missing" template appropriate, since they ' re missing, or is it inappropriate, since I believe that no reliable source has that information ? __label__1 So the usages are quoted .. and from a 34 - year - old *professor* no less!??! What is this world coming to ? __label__1 sorry, last question..alot of my fucntionality is gone ( it was an autocomplete search field)..does this mean I have to add all the elements I want back into my module above? or is there a way for it to only modify what I tell it to change ? __label__1 Hi there, it looks like the moving editor has added a bunch of references to the talk page supporting the fact Toto is no longer formally referred to as Moorland Totilas. Do you think if we added one or more of the refs he ' s added on the talk page to the article we could move it back ? __label__1 I was wondering where you got your information for the dice statistics you recently added / changed in <url>. Can you add a source to those tables ? __label__1 Can you provide more details? Did your application launch at all before you received this dialog ? __label__1 I have proposed the merge for you at these pages: <url>/<url>. Is that what you wanted ? __label__1 does the fading stay constant? Or do you also want to change how lighter or darker the top gets??__label__1 I assume you ' ve already considered using the Featured Image and decided it doesn ' t meet your use case? (Are these a large number of existing posts, or are you designing a system for posts to be added in the future?)__label__1  " pyparsing" appears to be a word specific to Python. Is there a more general programming term for that type of action ? __label__1 Looking at my various edit summaries to <url>, I don ' t see any where I mentioned anything about another example. Can you say which edit you have in mind ? __label__1 It could well be. Can you tell me how your were turning off CSS styles in IE7 please ? __label__1 Are you sure to have more than 4 images / node? Also, are you the one behind http://ww . drupality . be ? __label__1 Have you tried running it from the command line? `softwareupdate --list` to see if it spits out any errors ? __label__1 @den: OK, so the rectangles are represented as two points. Is this a vector representation or a raster ?__label__1 Hi, hopefully I will have the <url> ''wonderful - joy - of - a - job'' task done by tomorrow so will be able to join you with the infobox - adding task thereafter. Do you have a method, or is it just A &ndash; Z ? __label__1 Can you please post some code. How is data received at the client side ? __label__1 By "implementing square", do you mean implementing a function such that `f ( x) = x^2`, or `f ( x) = x`? Also, what is the precise list of operators you are not allowed to use ? __label__1 Wow, thanks for pointing that out. I ' m having a bad night, and all the theading.. anyway, did I get them all ? __label__1 I ' m probably going to be sorry I asked, but what ' s a BA? "Bachelor of Arts", "Benefits Administrator", "Bad Ass"?__label__1 BFS is a pretty basic graph - searching algorithm - seems like it would take a ginormous graph to make it infeasible.. How big is a normal graph (both edges and vertices)? Also, how is it stored ? __label__1 We were actually also interested in this idea. Can you give a little more detail as to how you do this? When do you add the water? How much water ? __label__1 So, your app creates a new html for each login? Or for each user ? __label__1 What does it mean that you want "the variation between routes" as small as possible? Could you rephrase the question ? __label__1 Asking for an iPhone app specifically is off - topic for here. Try the Electronic Gadgets SE: http://area51 . stackexchange . com / proposals / 614 / electronic - gadgets maybe ? __label__1 I can ' t find a page by that name that has ever existed. Can you please specify the exact name (capitalization is important), or link to the deletion log or discussion ? __label__1 What kind of system did you develop the script on (and the make - file)? Did the actual files come from a Windows system originally ? __label__1 How about saying that the fastest flow is near the deepest part of the channel, and that in most meanders this is near the outer bank? What do you think ? __label__1 Thanks very much indeed! :-) I don ' t suppose you ' d fancy having a deadlink trawl over at <url>, would you ? __label__1 It works without errors. Can you please add a [minimal example](http://meta . tex . stackexchange . com / q / 228 / 1235) that illustrates your problem ? __label__1  " Initrd requires at least one file system driver be compiled into the kernel".. I dint get much idea on this. Could you please explain this??__label__1 At first sight I can ' t see what ' s wrong with the code you ' ve posted. What error or problem does this produce ? __label__1 I haven ' t used photoshop in ages, but that seems quite large. Do you mean the size of the files on disk, or do you mean the memory footprint of the file when you ' re working with it ? __label__1 How is your DAL structured? Is there only one Assembly ? __label__1 I really think that the text you have drafted at <url> is far fuller and better than the article as currently drafted. Do you have any objection to me deleting the current text (except for the infobox which I will retain) and importing you text in its entirety ? __label__1 Should I use EBNF, and then compile it using http://pyparsing . wikispaces . com / file / view / ebnf . py to generate pyparsing grammar? Or should I write pyparsing grammar directly ? __label__1 I read your publication and enjoyed seeing the relationship between activeness and chance of success to become an admin. Are you planning to do a similar model for bureaucrats ? __label__1 Community wiki? (Also: sigoldberg1, can we have a link?)__label__1 I think it is important to note that Spirit 03 was the last gunship to be brought down and that it has not been involved in a Class A mishap since that date.

Wondering if we should look at applying it almost universally for medical pages ? __label__1 Are you using the default expression evaluator? Also have you tried applying the line directive to the ret instead of a nop ? __label__1 Thanks, the logo looks much better now. You wouldn ' t have a logo for the two predessesor clubs by any chance ? __label__1 This still shows old and read messages. How do you fix that ? __label__1 I ' ve filed a <url> in regard to all the recent IPs with which RFD and I have been involved. Could you look there and offer an opinion ? __label__1 Are you also interested in common real - world uses of other Public / Private key protocols besides RSA (e . g. DSA etc?)__label__1 if you mean _window . onload = onload_, then that would work, or something similar. have you tried your example to see what happens ? __label__1 I have started it at <url>, but as you can imagine there are lots of gaps! I think the first steps are categorising articles and getting a parameter added to <url>, what do you think ? __label__1 @q0987 If that ' s the case, then you ' re leaving out some crucial information. Perhaps you could tell us why you think it ' s wrong as that might reveal what you left out in the question ? __label__1 I ' ve tweaked it further: It ' s now accurate, to within my ability to describe a complicated subject, but rather too complicated. Can we simplify it without losing precision, or, alternately, put something before the precise definition that ' s a bit easier to understand ? __label__1 I think it ' s time we considered a perma - block on the IP in question. Comments ? __label__1 Thank you. Could you please describe it more in detail or send some link dealing with logos in this software ? __label__1 How many is "several different"? How big are |L| and |S|, relatively / absolutely? ~~__label__1 I hope I ' ve translated this okay; please check it.

Or must you be an administrator to do that ? __label__1 Although I didn ' t know that there is such a function in sql. Are there any others like this ? __label__1 I noticed that the A team article for Australia is at <url> instead of <url>.

If not, what else would you need in an answer ? __label__1 Thanks! Why not in refrigerator? Does that do harm ? __label__1 Hey. I ' m proposing a <url> - would you be interested in coming along ? __label__1 Do you mean the font size of a TTY, or of a terminal within X? If the latter, which terminal emulator ? __label__1 I found <url> while working <url> from <url>, my first impulse was to give it a prod, an long unreferenced orphan without a clear reason to exist. I see you are still active on Wikipedia, is there chance you can do something for this article ? __label__1 Depends, where will you base the generated code on? Database, XML, Diagram ? __label__1 Although I agree more or less with your recent edits on the article, I don ' t think that when the example of the Texas Statutes is given, changing the language of the precise statute is appropriate. Perhaps finding another example from another state would change the language appropriately without removing the quoted citation ? __label__1 I can certainly suggest to Isarig that 3RR is not an entitlement, and that dicussion is often the better approach. Would you like me to try to mediate the Karsh page ? __label__1 Wow! How did you find this ? __label__1 <url> is kindxe1 related to the subjects we have been dealing with. Would you mind if I ask you for advice ? __label__1 Very good! Thanks.

(East Anglians for example)?__label__1 Your reasoning is very sound, it would appear that USGS is wrong and I have no problem with changing it back. In general, what are your thoughts on using the GNIS database for park coordinates / elevations as we convert to the Geobox ? __label__1 @Zimbabao Cached MySQL is our front - runner at the moment. Has that worked well for you ? __label__1 Your code is missing the `find _ current _ round` subroutine. Could you post it as well ? __label__1 How exactly should the effect look like? Fading out at the borders or something similar ? __label__1 What value does CreateProcessAsUser return? If it returns zero (indicating an error), what does the GetLastError() function return ? __label__1 Not according to the history on <url>. Can you give me a link to follow, please ? __label__1 It ' s double the disambiguation.. Might be an overkill. What do you say ? __label__1 I could swear that a similar question has been dealt with here, but I can ' t seem to find it. Anyone able to ? __label__1 Nice! Can we get this for our Stack Overflow profiles, please ? __label__1 Can you describe the problem in more detail?

Which paragraphs from the [link](http://reactivated . net / writing _ udev _ rules . html) are relevant to me ? __label__1 You recently deleted my photograph of Harrington, NSW stating 'blatant copyright infringement', I ' m not sure how you came to this conclusion as I took this photograph myself and authorise it for use under a creative commons licence. I ' m no expert at Wikipedia and am not sure how to get the photograph back; would you be able to restore the image and the link to it on the Harrington, NSW Wikipedia page ? __label__1 @Martin: I think modification of boot . efi wont be so risky, i can simply time machine back to my old system if anything goes wrong, right? Would u please provide me with modification instructions ? __label__1 LDAP and nfs are two different issues. What about using LDAP for authentication and autofs to automatically mount the home directory via nfs ? __label__1 So what do you need help with ? Where are you stuck ?__label__1 What platform are you coding for? iPhone / iPad or Mac in general ? __label__1 He ' s stumped about what the block is for, and so am I.

Do you know of one ? __label__1 Saw your note on Herbythyme ' s pageu2014this is great! How come this isn ' t more widely "publicized"?__label__1 The only 2gb executables I know about contain archives themselves.

Any plans for an iPad specific version ? __label__1 I ' m trying to install Lupin / Anti - vandal tool, but im stuck. Could you help please ? __label__1 These two factors make me think that Indian ice - cream is a better name for the article than sxusem. What are your thoughts on this ? __label__1 sorry I can ' t find a folding trike on the Catrike website, do you know the model name ? __label__1 Great job. Will it be done by next week ? __label__1 @kemp - Unless I ' m missing it you haven ' t included a link that to home page so we can see it for ourselves. Can you do that ? __label__1 Hi, <url>. Do you have a suggestion as to how these article make Wikipedia better ? __label__1 Thanks for letting me know. btw on that page I found <person> but before adding that to the list I was wondering if the templatelist on the project should go so deep into detail or if it just stay Germany wide ? __label__1 One more thing if you want, let ' s talk on the Seinfeld talk page. I think I am taking up your talk page so let ' s talk there instead, ok ? __label__1 sir.. can i still write an article? do you have any facebook account ? __label__1 I don ' t understand your question. Can you please elaborate and clarify a little more ? __label__1 Same problem here. Can you still remember how you got rid of it ? __label__1 Very true. Out of interest, what do you make of the new kits ( s)?__label__1 You ' re unblocked. Do you want to discuss what the article should be named ? __label__1 Sorry for the late reply , I have taken view based template . Actually I need to convert the pdf page to image and in that process it ' s giving me error with the code above. Any solution ? __label__1 Hi Finell: I have filed an RfC at <url>. Could you take a look at this matter and proffer some advice ? __label__1 @DADU What changes do you want to make on that HTML string? Can you give some examples ? __label__1 @ikegami: Can you suggest an easier one for beginners? SOAP::Lite seems to be advocated as 'the easiest' all around ? __label__1 That is a weird site. For one they count forum software as "Content Management" but then neglect Wordpress ? __label__1 That looks OK to me (just learning Haskell myself, though). Is there anything specifically wrong ? __label__1 Not related to your Question but is Visual Studio 6 supported on Vista? & isn ' t JIT just for managed code ? __label__1 So, you essentially want to fetch most frequent words from the text. Is that correct ? __label__1 Thanks for the ce ' s on Attachment therapy. Are you kindly undertaking the second opinion ? __label__1 Have you tried connecting manually using telnet? If so what prompts do you get for username and password ? __label__1 Don ' t worry about it. Take it easy, keep the ranting to a minimum and the productive editing to a maximum :) And you ' re still not convinced you should get an account ? __label__1 Over at <url> you ' ve changed my request for protection on <url> to a request for unprotection. Is there a reason for that, since the page has yet to be protected ? __label__1 Hi again - it looks like the same user is editing out all the information about Destiny being self - centred again. Is there some way we can stop this user from making these edits ? __label__1 I don ' t know which of the answers I should select as the "accepted answer" as each one answers a part of my question. What is the normal procedure here ? __label__1 Just a note, the code snippet actually works so I am thinking that there is something inside my SomeObject (the full code and not the snippet) that is causing it to autorelease. Can an object autorelease itself without have been told to ? __label__1 I started on it. Do you more info on the last article on the list of references ? __label__1 I ' m trying to keep Minority Report as a GA, and the <url> requested for copyediting - but didn ' t give examples to cleanup.

Have you tried just adding them to a list as you get follow notifications ?__label__1 Seems to work fine for me. What values are you passing to the method when it doesn ' t work ? __label__1 There are many varieties of "useful". What do you need / want these books for ? __label__1 Okay thanks. Any easy way to determine this ? __label__1 Why the hell was this migrated from SO? What made them think it belonged here ? __label__1 I think `chunklen` needs to also be able to decrease, or else your queue will have size proportional to its largest - ever size even if it is empty. So how about `if (q->head->next == q->tail) chunklen/=2`?__label__1 Your question is unclear - do you need help getting the urls into the database? are these in a file ? __label__1 Yes, that ' s fine, especially with the smaller sections. Where will they be posting their topic ideas ? __label__1 4. I had once felt that the Euroleague, Italian and Greek leagues were the top leagues. If I were to choose selected European leagues from this page <url>, do you have any thoughts on which ones are important ? __label__1 Noticed your comments on the <url> talk page. What bands / styles are you into ? __label__1 Thanks for the pointer, but now I am not sure to understand your problem. Could you add a drawing ? __label__1 Up to you - I see myself picking off one or two every now and then but nowhere near the level of work NortyNort is doing now. By the way, I have an open CCI request that I want a second opinion on - could you please help ? __label__1 Oh ok- i know exchanges LOVE multicast. Anyway, are you trying to get a second machine to process the data for redundancy or for more throughput ? __label__1 A agree with vsz. But if you want to apply this to dark car segmentation, what about negating the image and running the same approach ? __label__1 Wow! Tricky.. and interesting. Do you need a method that works externally, or can all of the array fit comfortably in memory ? __label__1 I can ' t understand you. Can you show an example ? __label__1 Here ' s a simple example based on what you provided: http://fbrell . com / saved / 58a66f765babcdd3d7b452afe02b4e41 -- works fine for me. Maybe you can provide some more details ? __label__1 Then can you suggest me something, how should i do it. Because if i sort the array, i loose track of indexes, and i need to know which index the value came from??__label__1 Sorry about that. Better luck next time, OK ? __label__1 @Olof Sorry for the typo! I wanted to ask whether all primary operators are annihilated by $S$ and $\bar { S}$ ?__label__1 Any hints, ideas, clues. Why am I not able to install again to the real device ?__label__1 If it ' s just a matter of a few specialised custom macros, then a bit of find - and - replace would suffice, no? Or is the problem that they won ' t accept certain packages' macros ? __label__1 Thanks for striking out the comment. Any chance of a support / oppose vote ? __label__1 Ok, so this is the answer I have come up with after reading all the posts on here: "This statement will return true because $var is being assigned a value of donut, and assignment occurs before the statement is evaluated and therefore would be boolean true because it has a value." Is this correct ? __label__1 What exactly do you mean by platform ? Are you looking for product you will run on servers, framework / library to incorporate into own web app or 3rd party service ?__label__1 Thanks. Now, if I had to make an infobox on "London" (just ''London'', I know there are many terms: Greater London, City of London etc), would it be correct to include the area / population / density of the territories I mentioned + the city area, or would just the city area suffice ? __label__1 I ' m pretty sure I didn ' t violate 3RR unless there ' s another revert I ' m missing. Does replacing the "/" in <tt>&lt ; ref name=missingref /></tt> when replacing a deleted reference count as a revert ? __label__1 @pickypg thanks. Can I extend JApplet and use it to the web application ? __label__1 see if the `returnList . firstChild . textContent` is returning an array or not? By your statement can I assume that its working in FF and others ? __label__1 I think I might know how you could test to see if there ' s even a path between start and end, but don ' t know (at least not yet) how to calculate the least number of circles to remove. Would this be at all useful ? __label__1 @David: By the way, I hate to state the obvious, but just looking at the regions you selected in your graph, it looks like you chose the area in the lowest quartile. Is that a sufficient criteria ? __label__1 You never said *why* you want to do this. What ' s the problem with the current setup ? __label__1 Hey, you seem to know a bit about coding, so I figured you might have an answer here. If I want use code to grab the target of a page known to be a redirect, how would I do that ? __label__1 Regarding our WikiProject discussion about airport naming, I am unsure about Wiki etiquette - should I edit your sandbox with links indicating the common name (i . e. airport even though it ' s an aerodrome) or should I list them on my own talk page ? __label__1 How did you try setting the default encoding? Can you give us an example ? __label__1 Sounds good to me. Shall we have a straw poll on it ? __label__1 Good day, sorry to bother you. Is the 2 : 00 am news brief called eyewitness news everynite, and if it is do they play move closer to your world ? __label__1 It could be a blockage. Does it drain ok ? __label__1 @jblue who said that hes not going to do any work himself. as you imply ? __label__1 Thanks for the tip. What is the best way to freeze it, though? I mean, aside from what I make with it when I finally decide to eat it, how do I best store it for another day ? __label__1 We both reverted the article to fix vandalism, but I took it back to a version with more Wikilinks. What do you think ? __label__1 My end goal is to get a list of rows with unique data (as determined by a combination of 3 cells in a row); however, I need all the cells of the unique rows. Maybe an array of hashes would be better suited for this task ? __label__1 How are `g _ rx _ buffer` and `BYTE` defined? What compiler are you using ? __label__1 I ' d really like to keep the image, just because it ' s of a Medal of Honor winner. Is there a way to shrink the table, or another place in the article (Like the Footnotes section) where the image would work ? __label__1 @karmicpuppet: No, but I notice that ImageBrush has Viewbox and Viewport properties. Should I try to set them manually ? __label__1 I went to <url> and couldn ' t find it. Can you provide a link ? __label__1 The content has recently been added to <url>. Would you consider changing your vote to delete ? __label__1 I noticed you had 3 answers. Did they give you the information you need or did they not answer your question in full ? __label__1 I always forget testing things in IE. Just out of curiosity, did you test this code on other browsers ? __label__1 Are you packing boxes into box - shaped bins? Can you rotate boxes to make them fit ? __label__1 Although Singapore does not use Traditional Chinese, I still think we should at least add Traditional Chinese titles for shows not made by Mediacorp, and bought from overseas (mainly Hong Kong) TV stations. What do you think ? __label__1 Good luck on your <url>. What time is <url> <url>?__label__1 Can you overlap jobs? If you have two three - unit jobs and six two - unit jobs, can you run the three - unit jobs sequentially on lane A, three two - unit jobs on B, and three two - unit jobs on C, taking six units of printing time in total ? __label__1 I found this talk page (and <url>) while deleting the user pages that you requested. Would you like to have them deleted as well ? __label__1 I found <url> on your <url> as a bluelink, but in fact it is a redirect to <url>. Is there any chance to do some qeue - jumping on this article, or would it be easier to translate from <url>?__label__1 I don ' t recall any consensus on that unilateral change. Can you direct me to it, please ? __label__1 @Jack Leow: I tried both running the server in debug mode & inspecting "content" and displaying it on the console with System . out . println(). @John Wagenleitner: Any idea as to what could be wrong on my side ? __label__1 Have you tried stepping through your program with a debugger? Have you tried adding useful `cout` trace statements to investigate what ' s going on ? __label__1 Hi DeltaQuad, Since several reviews have been done, can you review the version from the same date? 1 July 2010 ? __label__1 @sarnold It shows Number of input = 22936722 49 . Can anyone rationalise this strangeness ? __label__1 I know this is a bit outside your usual territory but I wonder if you would be interested in helping us get <url> to FA status in time for the 50th anniversary of the line ' s closure on 10 June 2011? A question has also arisen in connection with the proper referencing of a journal article using the sfn template: when quoting a journal article - say from January 2010 - should the correct formulation be <nowiki><person></nowiki> or should the month be dropped ? __label__1 That ' s a pretty simple way. Does it work ? __label__1 Could you please check the solutions for hyperref? Also, how can I put something (one time only) that is formatted like a chapter* in the toc, but without the page number ? __label__1 Just curious: why should you want to use live wallpapers ? Doesn ' t that drain your power much quicker ?__label__1 Will do that. As an aside (and please, I ' m sorry if I should not ask this here), is it possible to add code blocks in a comment ? __label__1 Hi Zaps, thanks for adding a source to the timetable as a reference for the destinations served. But how do you know that Sharjah and Istanbul are operated as charter flights ? __label__1  " glug glug glug" sounds like no air behind water. Have you checked the vents on the roof ? __label__1 Since you ' re only trying to detect gnome vs kde, is there a particular set of distros or configurations you ' re targeting? How general does the solution have to be ? __label__1 Thanks, but I am now having trouble finding it. Any suggestions ? __label__1 Hi, Wereon - I ' m afraid I ' m rather amateur at nominating articles for deletion. Where do I start ? __label__1 I ' m actually still stucked.. Even if I specify a file to Vim in my program (using the backticks), it stills going to start in a subshell. Is there a way to start vim in the current user shell ? __label__1 I was somewhat confused, but after a while thinking I agree that although requiring the same answer, the question is different. Is there somewhere a guideline to this ? __label__1 Since you ' re also allowing nodes to be visited more than once, then there are an infinite amount of paths: `4 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 5`, (you can keep repeating `2 - 1 - 2 - 1-..`). Perhaps I ' m misinterpreting your question ? __label__1 Is the `.linkQuantite` element a child of the `<tr>` element? Does it work when you do `$(this).parent('tr').attr('class'));`?__label__1 Not offended - let ' s talk about it. Doesn ' t "Avatar" refer to the series as well as the character ? __label__1 Following your edit, it looks like your rescue is catching a SystemExit exception (raised when you call exit) rather than the TypeError from trying to join nil with a String. What ' s on multi . rb line 234 ? __label__1 POST implies you want to send some data to the server. Why wouldn ' t you just use GET when all you want to do is GET data ? __label__1 I ' m having difficulty understanding your question. Could you please give a few more details, or explain what it is that isn ' t working for you ? __label__1 I asked some questions in the Criteria for Inclusion section on 20th Dec but no - one has yet responded. Can you take a look ? __label__1 Yes I can. Is it an alternate account ? __label__1 I should be able to get that Mayr paper, it ' s on Wiley. Do you need me to email it to you ? __label__1 Could it be a permissions issue? Does your cron job have privileges in /var/ ?__label__1 with an ndash rather than a hyphen. Can that be fixed ? __label__1 @user391 - I really don ' t like doing this but I ' m going to recommend we close this because it is really not about WordPress but about those other solutions and by definition will be off - topic, see http://area51 . stackexchange . com / proposals / 1500 ? phase=definition As a moderator I can close but I want 1 or 2 other opinions before I do. Others agree or disagree ? __label__1 A DVT is tailored to a design. What is the design ? __label__1 @Sklivvz If you like riddles, here you are -- one puts an ice cube in a glass and fills it up with water. How much water will flow out when the ice cube melts ? __label__1  " I ' m not sure what the most efficient way of doing this is." Try both and see which one is faster ? __label__1 I ' m not clear about this, if you ' re asking for a cryptographically secure random number generator - even with certain additional constraints - then that ' s easy, just tell us which platform / language you ' re on. If you ' re asking for something else - then it ' s not clear, and why would you ask on ITsec ? __label__1 I have a question about this topic. Consider the general component diagram, not the instances one: should we draw two sockets (connection) from the philosopher to the dining room / fork interface or is one enough ? __label__1 For the record, there are about a bazillion "big gears" in Limbo. Next time include a screenshot perhaps ? __label__1 I have already read this - thank you very much for this kind gesture, dear friend. What ' s up with you ? __label__1 I ' m sure you ' re right but I can ' t find it in FM and haven ' t found it anywhere else. Could you cite sources in the article ? __label__1 What language / platform are you using for parsing? What library ? __label__1 Sorry, its not immeadiately obvious why thats a revert. Can you clarify ? __label__1 Could `curl` help with this? Any idea how ? __label__1 Sorry, which Documents? Is this some iPhone directory ? __label__1 I presume you ' re using PHP as an Apache module? (Not CGI or running under IIS or something?)__label__1 Works like a charm here using XE. Do you have specific steps ? __label__1 Hi, I tweaked it again. Could you check please ? __label__1 I have left a comment on the Talk page under that section. You haven ' t said much there - is there some place where you present your view with a little more detail ? __label__1 @Stefan: Not sure what you mean by the comment above, sorry. Want to take it to chat ? __label__1 I removed that second paragraph entirely, since the information is covered in the article. Do you feel that the lead should be larger ? __label__1 Not exactly clear what you mean: Wisconsin CDPs are just like CDPs in the rest of the country, and they already have <url>. Or do you mean something that I ' m missing ? __label__1 I would be willing to move this article to the incubator so that it can be worked on (I agree it wouldn ' t be an A7 today), though if it ' s to be made into a real article it needs to be done with someone with no conflict of interest regarding the subject, as creating articles for things you own is highly discouraged. If I undelete it to the incubator would you agree to let it go and leave it up to other users without a conflict of interest ? __label__1 Could you please tell us what toppings are on them ? __label__1 Same thing happens to my with my Droid when checking my google voice messages. I think that the proximity only works with the Phone Dialer maybe ? __label__1 I need to read more about what exactly a pastoral opera is supposed to be. Perhaps it should be a supercategory ? __label__1 Hey, I reverted your edits on recognition because the statements were already relayed in footnotes, which I hadn ' t realised when you brought it up on the talk page. Did you want to move the statements to the main text ? __label__1 What environment are you developing under? OS X, Linux or Windows ? __label__1 Thanks! By the way, have you sent anything to Maggie since you received the email from the photographer ? __label__1 The only books by Paul I was able to find were ''Concordia the Lutheran Confessions: A Readers Edition of the Book of Concord'' (Hardcover - not yet released) and ''Communion fellowship: A resource for understanding, implementing, and retaining the practice of closed communion in the Lutheran parish'' (Unknown Binding - Jan 1, 1992). Are those his scholarly works ? __label__2 I am not an expert but I found the sentence "controlling for associated subscores when devising cut - off scores on each dimension of a measurement scale" a bit esoteric. Can you give me one more line of explanation (otherwise I found it difficult to understand the question) ?__label__2 A question has come up whether <url> was Jewish (see <url>). Do you have any references that might help ? __label__2 @genneth please correct me if I ' m wrong, but isn ' t the inverse effective mass given by an expression of the form $m^{-1} = \partial^2 E ( k)/\partial k _ a \partial k _ b $, where $E ( k)$ is the dispersion relation, $k _ a, k _ b$ are directions in momentum space, and for simplicity we assume that $m^{-1}_{ab} := m^{-1}$? So given the energy spectrum of Aluminum one can calculate the effective mass for any excitation of momentum $k$ in its brillouin zone ? __label__2 This is argumentative. Are these kind of questions permitted ? __label__2 Don ' t worry, I ' m not going to give the new right out to people who ' ll abuse it. :) Where ' s the new policy page ? __label__2 Any errors? what is in the debug console ? __label__2 Your symlink might have been removed by `ldconfig`. Your description is confusing, could you edit it with the exact file names involved at each step ? __label__2 Finally, I checked with articles Plastid, Mitochondria and Mitochondrial genome, and see they all use the term 'genome', and that there is no suggestion that they have 'chromosomes'. So may we at least get rid of that usage on the Chromosome article ? __label__2 Did you manage to sort this out in the end and get the corners? Can you post your final code ? __label__2 Which version of Xcode? Have you tried debugging with different versions (3 and 4)?__label__2 Regarding <url> and others. You want me to speedy the wikipedia pages because the SVG tag was erroneously placed here rather than on commons, correct ? __label__2 ahh.. so 'Wikipediholic' is preferred to 'Wikipediaddiction' .. so the malady is at least recognised, good. Where can one obtain help to fight this insidious addiction ? __label__2 And what about a more generic function such as f ( x, y, z, w) = xxb2 + 2yxb2 + 3zxb2 - wxb2? Would a Hessian be the only way to solve it ? __label__2 if id=r2 is selected, id=r1 should be de - selected? de - selection of a radio button isn ' t captured by this ? __label__2 You ' re very welcome. What no stones thrown my way for referring to Bishzilla, as a damsel in distress ? __label__2 How are you removing the object? Are these objects allocated on the heap dynamically or is it an array on the stack ? __label__2 @jleedev - I found the same thing (both in Ruby 1 . 8 . 6 and Ruby Enterprise 1 . 8 . 7). irb ' s great, but if you run the exact same commands from a file.. Do you think it ' s a bug in the Ruby implementation (REE mostly just redid the garbage collector)?__label__2 Do you have symbols present, and are you sure the source is the same as the assembly you are debugging? Did you rebuild ? __label__2 Maybe I ' m missing something.. What ' s the purpose of a door on an oven? Isn ' t it to keep the heat in ? __label__2 <url> wasn ' t me. Could you possibly go back and correct the AN / I thread ? __label__2 Drive - by comment: Mikka ' s behaviour reminds me of Stevertigo ' s on <url>.. perhaps an RfC is in order? Nothing harsh, just an opportunity to clarify some policy points on protection and blocking ? __label__2 Looks like it ' s hardwired. Is that common in Germany ? __label__2 @Ding, List A is in the database, and it can have > 100K rows? What is the typical (and maximum) size of list B ? __label__2 If you are refering to the recent work I have been doing, I think most of it has just been fixing small format errors. Could you do me a favor and let me know what edit I have mistakenly marked as ''m''inor so that I can watch out for mistakenly labeling such edits as ''m''inor in the future ? __label__2 What is your question about? How to address the image, or how to change the image source ? __label__2 I am assuming that I need libgtkembedmoz . so, but I don ' t know where to find it. What does that mean ? __label__2 Clearly, Boost smart pointers are useful, but they ' re not revolutionary for design ! Are you considering Boost libraries as a whole in your question, or just smart pointers ?__label__2 restart using the same JVM or completly shut - down the JVM and restart using a new one? BTW: Which operating system ? __label__2 I read the article and can see where it already addresses some of his reliabilty issues. I guess that as long as it was clear that the quotes were from his autobiography and if any other info on the lack of collaboration (from the intro or foreword of the new edition of his autobiography) were included, I think it would be OK. Is there a lot of material to add that is only in his autobiography ? __label__2 Well if that is.. I don ' t think the DI Extension is being loaded. How can I check this ?__label__2 How do you compare strings? strcmp()?__label__2 Acad, I see we have one fairly ambiguous comment at <url>, dealing with hyphenation, which is one of the things we agree on, if memory serves. Any advance on 4 people who care ? __label__2 Why couldn ' t you do a (concrete, stone) patio, with one step down from the door (assuming the door is high enough to need a step). Is there a reason this has to be a deck ? __label__2 Despite the good answers, this is still a REALLY poor question a) because of the lack of information and confusing wording b) because - depending on what the question actually is - it ' s unlikely to be of use to anyone else. Can someone with edit permissions tidy it up ASAP, please ? __label__2 Which window do you mean? The one that currently has focus on the desktop ? __label__2 "$(xml).find" Is that supposed to be xml _ url ? __label__2 Um, I ' ll check it out, 141 . 158 . 210 . 110, but I haven ' t had a lot of edits (if any) on that article. In the mean time, why not <url> and join the Wikipedia community ? __label__2 Hi, the only reason I called it <url> is because there are similarly named streets in <url> and <url>, and the latter one has some notoreity. Should we wait until articles are written about the streets in those other cities before identifying this one as belonging to <url>?__label__2 The logo gallery on the <url> article is acting very strange. Can you help me with this ? __label__2 Hi, I just had a look at the <url> article and spotted that the link <url> goes to a dab page, are any of the options there the right one ? __label__2 Could you expand the abbreviation so it is concretely understood? What is PES ? __label__2 Do you have the ability to authenticate users (through login or whatnot) and to "grade" them, a bit like SO users. In this fashion you will soon get enough "trusted citizen" susceptible of flagging offensive data ?__label__2 You mean pick an arbitrary point along the edge of a shape, then place 4 more points, each 1 / 5 of the total perimeter from the last? Or by points do you mean vertices ? __label__2 what type is curr _ time2? What data type does get _ time _ in _ seconds() return ? __label__2 Nice. Could you please link back to the source ? __label__2 Is it an issue with a particular app? For the apps that give you a dropdown menu, does it at least consistently provide the dropdown ? __label__2 That ' s true, sorry. But couldn ' t we try to use the fact that comparisons are bitwise to try to "group" them by any way even if the order of the objects isn ' t the same as the order induced by the binary representation ?__label__2 This article was recently submitted for <url> but it appears to be missing a reference to "James". Could you fix that please ? __label__2 How long is the project supposed to last? How many more people would be involved in your project ? __label__2 I am able to do it using htmlText property. But, I want to wrap text around HBox ( that contains image)?__label__2 are you looking at the site from the exact same browser? no compatibility mode etc ? __label__2 Reset means what exactly? (Keeps the session going, clears the session, ..?)__label__2 Is your app doing anything interesting at the time? Maybe loading another assembly ? __label__2 I was thinking about this too - pbuilder is quite slow on my machine.. unfortunately, I only have 2GB of RAM. Would that work for small projects ? __label__2 Where did you read this? Could you please provide a link ? __label__2 Have any examples for inputs with hex values other than 1 and 0? What does `00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02` give you ? __label__2 You added the ''persondata'' material. Did you want to add any substantive material ? __label__2 @Jaroslav: Sorry, I checked the linked page and didn ' t see anything obvious. Do you thing that replacing the $*$ with $\cdot$ would be ok ? __label__2 True, true. But at least ''half'' that small minority are editing these articles ;-) And it ' s such a nice sentence to introduce the constitutional aspects.. Perhaps I should re - frame it as legality ''"at the time"''?__label__2 I think those are actually two questions, none of which I understand properly.

Whose dumb design idea was that ? __label__2 Last month <url> was not promoted to FA because, apparently, not enough people had taken the time to read and comment. If I nominate it again, will you read it (it ' s lengthy) and comment ? __label__2 Whilst what you ' re doing is perfectly valid (don ' t forget to open the `ofstream` in binary mode.. whether your data is binary or not, frankly) I would have used `vector<char>` for the added feel - good factor. Any reason you didn ' t ? __label__2 If we are going to work together effectively we need to get past these personal issues. Might you consider mediation ? __label__2 the endpoints of the arc & the center of the circle specify either of two arcs (they complement eachother to make up the entire circle). how do you determine which arc is relevant ? __label__2 Clearly there aren ' t 10^16 credit card accounts.

What is that template ? __label__2 Isn ' t it not invisible? Why is the sky blue ? __label__2 Btw, I realized that it is not clear from your question that you ' re asking about *your own* passwords, for other services, stored on your desktop (or laptop, or whatever) - as opposed to an application / service storing passwords for all registered users. Can you put that clarification in the question (assuming I understood correctly)?__label__2 So the problem is that it crashes when you click the checkWord button?

Is it on all the boards ? __label__2 There is a recommendation on the talk page of the "<url>". What do you think of it ? __label__2 It might be wise to specify what kind of maps you ' re looking for. Standard bouts against players, or those special kinds of maps with non - standard objectives ? __label__2 Referring to the Nomination for Deletion <url>, you suggest that Bill4Time be "mentioned" under List of Legal Software. Would that enable the Bill4Time Wikipedia page to still exist ? __label__2 Hi Gzuckier. Any reason why single brackets need a nowiki tag (eg as on <url>)?__label__2 have any ideas for me? anybody ? __label__2 I wondered, simply because I see you occasionally and had never seen him before, so at first I thought he was you. I wonder if there ' s a User : Nyttned running around ? __label__2 I think the most likely error is that the <form> tag in the master page (or whatever page) doesn ' t have a runat="server" attribute?

Can you be specific about that ? __label__2 It looks to me that you don ' t simply want to combine them, you want them to be merged them together evenly like a zipper or cars politely merging on a highway. Am I correct ? __label__2 @Foon I just know that to compile in Linux I do gcc or g++ and in Solaris I do cc. Or am I wrong about it ? __label__2 I think you need to provide more details as to what is the intended purpose of such a function. There is definitely no cryptographic hash function with that property, but maybe you are looking for something different ? __label__2 Oh, I see that you removed the redirect from District of Columbia and restored the text. That has redirected to "Washington DC" for about 4 years now, and I ' ve reverted it - if you have something ambitious in mind, please bring it up on one of the talk pages first, okay ? __label__2 Heh, sorry mate ;) Anyway, I do sometimes want to drive an LED from a 74LS device, so now I know to buffer it first.

How do you suggest I get joint probability of all 5 vars being in top 5% and then probability of at least one hitting top 5%?__label__2 I found <url> which is completely unreferenced but I could not find any confirming sources.

Or are you talking about a theoretic algorithm to calculate and render such a widget ? __label__2 All the images are on the right side, which means they sometime clash and push the text away from itself. Have you considered moving some images to the left to stop this ? __label__2 have you checked the add attachment block is getting called, ie. that the file exists ? __label__2 What should we write, then? Do we make note of the split - up around 1917 and omit the mention of 1931, or do we make note of the split - up around 1917 and mention that the marriage (may have) lasted until 1931 ? __label__2 Can you describe your riding position a bit? Are you sitting fairly upright or really leaned forward in a more aggressive position ? __label__2 You are so right, <url> looks to be blatant advertising.

Is it dry as well ? __label__2 If plugs are falling out, it generally means the metal contacts inside the receptacles are worn out.

Could you please elaborate on this ? __label__2 Do you have any example? Could it be a path issue ? __label__2 Regarding <url>: you closed it as no consensus, and I admit its close, but there are four well thought out deletes and only three keeps don ' t (in my view) present any clear arguments. Do you mind taking another look ? __label__2 I think it look tidier. What do you think ? __label__2 In the example that you give, all numbers are used. Is this an accident or do you always want for this to be the case ? __label__2 I ' m not sure what you mean. The uploads will be public so you don ' t need to be logged in or anything, and the file checks can be done on the other servers after upload ? __label__2 Sometimes the display can freeze but the underlying processes are still going, so checking the logs was (and always is) a good idea. Do you actually notice that the timestamps in the logs stop increasing when the system freezes ? __label__2 `static _ assert`? Are you using C++0x ? __label__2 Is it a particular C++ implementation of the Towers of Hanoi?

If not, how did you fix it ? __label__2 Loading it into a frame also seems to work for me: http://testing . subdmedia . com / loadinggifframe . html. Can you post the full code for the iframe as well as well as the content, or better yet, a link to your test ? __label__2 It looks like you get either wrong character widths or kerning values. Did you try disabling the kerning altogether to check if you get correct character widths this way ? __label__2 And then people could not edit it, and my signature will become very long. Plus I think the loading is negligible, comparing people with SVG flags in their signature.. What do you think ? __label__2 I ' m following through here, with my comment on the original thread: Vote to close as S & A. On the other hand, perhaps (since this is particularly related to SE) we might carry this over to Meta ? __label__2 Hi, I was just going to query your recent removal of the <url> article, without merging any of the article ' s content into <url>'s article. Was there any particular reason for the loss of content ? __label__2 @Brendan personally I would tell your Host that CentOS 4 . 8 is not an option and you must have 5 . 0, generally speaking it ' s a giant no no for a host to change your version on you like that, esp if you have CLI access which usually means you ' re dedicated or VPS, they need to put you on the proper version. Outside of that would Mercurial or Git serve your purposes ? __label__2 Tips? Something about not feeding ? __label__2 Point taken. Would you like to be a mod ? __label__2 I ' ve created <url>, which I expected to be a 3 - line stub - amazing what these little lumps of rock have to say for themselves.

About which URL / file . php are you speaking when you say "default "post edit" screen"?__label__2 @Dan, I hear what your saying, but I ' m not sure what type of hash table you are describing.

What memory consumption does Task Manager show for this process ? __label__2 For 2003 - 04 the Tony Kempster site doesn ' t show steps, it shows levels (this was before the steps were introduced) - <url> when steps were introduced, the KCL was classed as Step 7 - like the Essex Intermediate League (all of whose club ' s articles have been deleted) it has never been a Step 6 league (hence no - one objecting to the other ten articles being deleted earlier in the week.

What have you tried so far ? __label__2 The topic is a good one I think, but the year of closure should be listed.

I don ' t understand the question fully, so you can probably give some example ? __label__2 Perhaps a nitpick, but a win - loss ratio of 60 - 40 is a little under 2 / 3 wins, not 3 / 4.

Is there anything else I can do to fix the article ? __label__2 Ok, would you mind if I created a UK specific category and shoved all the UK articles into there? I would suggest renaming the US category, and putting them both (and other countries) into 'Railway Companies' or similar ? __label__2 While I provided an answer - I ' m with @freiheit. Is there a more objective way to ask a similar question so that you get a set of useful answers ? __label__2 What is the `^` symbol? Is it **XOR** (programming notation) or **to the power** (mathematical notation)?__label__2 *@itrekkie*: Try as I might I don ' t understand the question. Could you clarify ? __label__2 I asked [a similar question](http://wordpress . stackexchange . com / questions / 2133 / changing - attachment - urls), where the new URLs are of the form `/media/[attachment name]/`. Is that also good for you ? __label__2 I don ' t know what I should be adding to the fstab, so I cannot implement this properly. Could you please help me ? __label__2 Almost all water heaters have two electric elements. Are you getting no hot water at all, or are you getting some, but it runs out quicker than it should ? __label__2 That ' s really nice! Did you decide against seeing vervandelt as dependent on "sich"?__label__2 Are you enumerating all substrings? As in, "ABCD" -> ["A","B","C","AB","BC","CD","ABC","BCD","ABCD"] ?__label__2 That ' s what figured. Thanks for the clarification. So how do you adapt for the missing arc in the measurement ? __label__2 There is something in designer code causing an error. Does this form have a custom control inside it ? __label__2 Sorry, I just don ' t see the long TeXed formula in TeX even though it looks OK in the preview - a strange bug that I am unable to fix. Can someone help ? __label__2 The question is not clear enough. Which bonuses are you talking about ? __label__2 Interesting. why the sugar ? __label__2 Query - please can you add to your question which version of ubuntu you are using. Have you tried either WiCD or NetworkManager ? __label__2 The block you created on April 18th has expired and a new rash of vandalism has broken out. Would you mind blocking this school for even longer than 1 month ? __label__2 @RoryAlsop - Yeah, the other thread, while still somewhat broad, is much more limited in scope. Let ' s give this one a shot, please ? __label__2 Really? Could you please tell us how to compute the maximum of $n$ $n$-bit numbers in AC$^0$?__label__2 It seems that this is not possible. Are there any Intellij folks on StackOverflow ? __label__2 please make us clear what do you mean by start menu bar.

Is their a pattern for the values of n ? __label__2 @kalle43 what is the rest length of the springs? is there any tension without displacement ? __label__2 Is this a CCK Image field?

[only for legal solutions] ?__label__2 You probably want to use your package manager, which depends on your distro. Which are you using ? __label__2 Can you create a short but complete program which demonstrates the problem? Are you sure you ' ve got the right using directive *in the file which contains that line*?__label__2 I started editing the article <url>, which was a real mess, and added some cited content under the math section. However, there is all this content under the statistics section that is uncited, and wanted to know if someone would help me find sources for this information, or challenge and remove it ? __label__2 Thanks, Sorry I was meaning to say "past perfect" not "present past". And my question was asking about an explanation why they make sense, can you help with that ? __label__2  * Electrolysis* (in title) is often used to split water into H2 and O2--distinct from *generating electricity* (in text).

Are you using C ? __label__2 @Dennis attenDANCE? like in SquareDance? :D__label__2 To answer that we need to know what you want to do with it. What are your goals ? __label__2 I ' m going to try and hurry the <url> article through both GA and FA to see if I can get it as the Featured Article on the Main Page in time for its 20 - year anniversary on October 18, 2009. Care to help a little or a lot ? __label__2 How are the values being input by the user in the first place? Some number of text fields ? __label__2 @Dunhamzz doesnt the useragent change only on update of browser software or windows? and i think that doesnt happen everyweek ? __label__2 Do you want a `list` where all of the values have a key in the `dict` greater - than - or - equal - to 6? Or do you want a `dict` where the there are no keys lower than 6 ? __label__2 @Tal, @John -- I know how standard vioplot works, but I can ' t figure out how those points were obtained (and as I see not only me, while it is crucial for producing good answer) -- some kind of stem? Or maybe someone just thought that filling vioplot with distorted polka dots is a good idea ? __label__2 Now as a sign of good faith on my part, I choose to recuse my "overturn" decision on the HHO deletion review. What is the proper wikipedia procedure for this ? __label__2 Does it reach the license initialization code before crashing? What licenses are you initializing ? __label__2 It was a joke. I mean, surely, a carbon frame has a major carbon price tag ? __label__2 Do you have ECE volume 4 (queen endings)? If so, how many diagrammed positions does it have ? __label__2 Great answer! Just for those not familiar with `\makeatletter`, could you please add `\makeatother` at the end of your code ? __label__2 Is it running debug mode? Is Visual Studio attached to the web server ? __label__2 To eliminate the (unlikely?) possibility that the Server migration is the cause, can you go back in time in your version control and get a version of your app from before the problem started appearing ? __label__2 just a question, why do you keep a list of the digits as booleans ? -have you thought of int _ of _ string with the right prefix ?- i mean do you need this intermediate data type ?__label__2 Got terrible ratings at my RfA. Other than that, I ' m just trying to get over 100 edits this month.. You ? __label__2 Where ' s the Perl? Are you talking about an off - the - shelf software here, if yes, what ' s its name ? __label__2 What error message do you get, if any? How is the table Employee defined ? __label__2 It should automatically pick them up. Is it not ? __label__2 Hi Ive been trying to clean the English version of this and the abandoned village to see if they can be on "did you know". Could you check the pages and get back to me ? __label__2 The discussion page at <url> does not note that semi - protection has been removed. Would you be willing to note your action there ? __label__2 Also, one can probably implement it using the language - level recursion, meaning that the second stack will be present *implicitly* as the "stack" of local contexts of nested function calls. Is this allowed ? __label__2 That sounds like they are just "general use" of the word, so in each article delink and (if needed) explain that, in this context, diaphragm means a divider - or just rewrite without the word diaphragm, or use a link to wiktionary. In fact, should linking to wiktionary be a standard way to clear up some of the links to dab pages ? __label__2 Are you sure you ' re not escaping the whole query string? Could you include your query calls as well ? __label__2 One thing I noticed though is that the letter rows ("0 - 9", "A", etc) look a bit strange when the table is sorted using a non - alphabetic criteria. Do you think we need them at all ? __label__2 Ordinarily, you ' d want to do that in the view controller that ' s presenting the array, typically by allowing the user to edit a table view. Is there a reason you need that responsibility to be shared across two view controller instances ? __label__2 Nice problem, although proposing a solution is difficult because the criteria for a "good" solution can be defined in many different ways (and since a perfect solution might not exist, you need to define a measure of quality). For example, if I come up with n - 1 buckets that are all equal but the last bucket is WAY off, is that better than n / 2 buckets that are all different, but within a fixed known bound of each other ? __label__2 Mo being megabytes (MB)? Or is this some new memory size unit ? __label__2 I thought you had done that, and started working on turning it into a disambiguation page. Could you now graft the history on to the changes I made ? __label__2 Are you looking for simple string edit - distance comparison or full on semantic equivalence? e . g. is cat more similar to cart or feline ? __label__2 For my curiosity, do you see a difference in focus confirmation when you ' re stopped down compared to wide open? The lens itself is wide open while focusing and only stops down just before exposure, but I ' m not familiar with the ins / outs of current AF systems; is it more forgiving when set to f / 8 ? __label__2 Hello. Was wondering where you got his Birmingham squad number from ? __label__2 Check the exception details - the stack trace should tell you exactly where this happens, so you can debug from there. Can you post the stack trace ? __label__2 @mathpasha I am not sure, if you are looking to typeset, big integers or large sized numbers as in font - size. Can you please clarify ? __label__2 But without the space it looks fine. Where is your blog that has such poor CSS that `<code>NULL</code>s` looks like it has an extra space ? __label__2 Please name the browser and version. Are you sure this is a WordPress related problem ? __label__2 Then no one ever sees that page? Isn ' t it the login page ? __label__2 anyone? help please ? __label__2 OK, I will do that. But probably we should first set the gallery up on commons - do you know anything about editing / creating there ? __label__2 The first thing to look at is `ls -l /home / guest / nis1`. Are you sure that the NFS server, the NIS server and the client all have the same user ID for `nis1`?__label__2 Has this situation been resolved? Can we all agree not to replace the comment regarding Orton ' s son until a secondary source can be provided ? __label__2 @Mathew - Very well written, but this is really more of a forum - style call to discussion than a stack - exchange - style question with a definitive answer. For now, have protected it to avoid short answers from new users, but what is the goal of this question ? __label__2 Interesting question!. Why not tagging "debugging"?__label__2 Do you just want to decrease the width of the image and that those 5px aren ' t visible anymore? Or do you want it to make it 5pixels less wide and resize to the new image size ? __label__2 Okay, I think I finally might "get it" well enough to leave this side discussion and take it back to the QD talk page. Meet me there ? __label__2 Thanks for the help, +1. Could you, please, specify, should I include the phrase "per the email.." before the salutation in the email or after it ? __label__2 Yes, your description is correct at a general level. Is there something about that description which doesn ' t make sense to you ? __label__2 Nice solution. What ' s a measuring jug ? __label__2 Is there any other output in your script? Is there any whitespace before `<?php`?__label__2 `maximum value for a particular row` ? In that case, which fields are involved in the maximum calculation ? __label__2 By `50 . 00` did you mean 500? 500 ? __label__2 All I ' m trying to say is that calling someone you ' re in a content dispute with a vandal isn ' t right. Let me ask you this, how do we stop the warring and conflict between users on Wikipedia that have real disputes outside Wikipedia ? __label__2 Another thing: <url> has created <url>. What do you think about it ? __label__2 just to clarify, the chain / screw it exposed on the bottom. How do I squirt grease in there to prevent from falling on the garage floor ? __label__2 So you want to use 256bits to make sure 1 bit was sent correctly. How will you make sure the hash is correct with a 2**20 ? __label__2 Hmm, it is returning only integers over here. Which PHP version ? __label__2 Does the error show up with any data set? Is there a minimum reproducible test case ? __label__2 Then why is the article for the monastery in Lhasa as "Ganden" instead of "Gandan"? Do both the monasteries have the same name ? __label__2 Josiah, believe me, I understand how you feel, and unless you really feel like it, I don ' t think you should involve yourself in the dispute, because it seems intractable. My question is more a procedural one: if an RfC doesn ' t generate consensus, and an edit war continues, what ' s the next step ? __label__2 Now I realized that the title of the question contains yet another expression “email me,” which is not mentioned in the text of the question. What is your question after all ? __label__2 Please mark homework as such. Have you tried talking to your professor yet ? __label__2 @Klark Why is the solution to the second example "not possible"? How about `(2 , 9) (5 , 1)`?__label__2 Any suggestions on what admin - specific readings I should be starting to go through, and what order? E . g., the actual mechanics of how to do some of the admin - related stuff ? __label__2 Did you try anything yet? Have some code ? __label__2 Some database action is linked to `stateChanged` so yes. I could use a counter so only the last event calls the mentioned DB method but maybe there ' s a clearer way ? __label__2 You want to generate an image like that given the original Van Gogh as input? Can you clarify ? __label__2 I need to be able to cite an online source using biblatex - mla. Did the author ever give an answer ? __label__2 How much control do you have over the network? I . e., are you authorized to do something like an authenticated vulnerability scan of the system in question ? __label__2 @Kerrek SB : What do you think about when talking about a formatted output ? stringWithFormat does not do the job ?__label__2 How about "Hi y ' all!" or "Howdy folks!"? ;)__label__2 Hey there. Do you mind if the Wells and Mendip Museum DYK you nominated ends up in the list of DYKs <url>, or would you rather it run sooner ? __label__2 I need the text version, however I am curious. Which is the very simple solution suitable for binary ? __label__2 A wikipedia project that serves as a place where users can get signatures, userboxes.. stuff like that, so they don ' t have to make it themselves or ask a specific user to do it. What do you think of that idea ? __label__2 Could you clarify this one `Create Menus for Custom Pages` ? Do you mean individual menu areas on some pages or what ? __label__2 The lack of `display _ name` is caused by a user not having a display name set in their profile. Incorrect usernames.. do you have an example of that ? __label__2 Can we assume anything about the alphabet? a - z, alphanumeric ? __label__2 hello. I do not know if others, but to me your question is not all clear (sorry). do you want show messages from a module of Drupal using javascript ? __label__2 With `n \ k`, do you mean `n / k`, i . e. "n divided by k"?__label__2 What is this code supposed to do? How are you approaching the data locality issues (this in my experience is the most important part of optimization)?__label__2 Welcome, Hunter! Typically we want questions here to be specifically related to photography, not just image editing; if your question is photography - related, perhaps you could edit it a bit to clarify that relevance ? __label__2 What is the (approximate) size of these two arrays? Is one much bigger than the other ? __label__2 If you use ctypes to call into a C DLL, it will release the GIL automatically. Did you look into using ctypes ? __label__2 Isn ' t SMS text only (max 140 chars). Afaik MMS is for images ? __label__2 I have my finger on the block button here <url> but thought I should run it by someone else who is familiar with the situation. What do you think ? __label__2 yes it is python 3 . x. what happened to raw _ input in python 3 ? __label__2 someone sitting on the window sills? I assume they are wood underneath with plaster on top and 5 / 6 inch wide marble slab on top ? __label__2 What did you try so far? Where are you stuck ? __label__2 As I don ' t want t give default values because when ever I change its height and width I also have to change it in code - which one can change? the image view or the images stored ? __label__2 Unfortunately, I ' m still worried this may not be enough to avoid arguments. <url> says "A separate rationale must be provided each time the image is used in an article." Should we just copy the tag for every article using the logo ? __label__2 It was based on the comments <url>. Do you have reason to believe otherwise ? __label__2 It needs to be redirected anyone can do that. Is there any information that is in the article that is not in <url>?__label__2 Tim, it strikes me that DNA is getting more than average vandalism for daytime; I suspect it ' s schoolbreak week somewhere. I ' m not able to help much as it takes so long for the page to load; do you think it ' s time to ask for a semi - protection break ? __label__2 Alright, thanks. Where do I find these templates ? __label__2 Even if the references to "Get a car" all point to the same object, the references still show up multiple times in the data structure. Do you have a flag on each Action and / or Task to indicate that it has been completed, and does not need to be executed again ? __label__2 So you ' re basically looking for the intersection between two non - axis - aligned rectangles? (Or, if they collide at all?)__label__2 @Walter neither `sudo` or `su` work: they both result in a `Permission Denied` error. Any other thoughts ? __label__2 Well, dd style meaning that I could either name / number a frame for extraction to a pipe &| file or that I could specify frame ranges in the way that dd does skip|seek|count. dd has it ' s own issues no doubt, but does dd _ rescue support seek ? __label__2 Check what you get from $('input . in') -> is it the first input? is it an array of all elements of that class ? __label__2 please edit your question with the link to this "deb". Also, what happens when you launch the software from a terminal session - any errors displayed ? __label__2 I did a little copy editing, added commas and such. Are you bringing it to DYK ? __label__2 I have a small problem. When I tell Swatch to find my user name it returns an error "There was a problem with the request: Status code = 500" Any ideas ? __label__2 @Suresh: the question is more sensible now. But what does "constant - factor approximation" mean in this context ? __label__2 You should be able to edit semi - protected pages at present, as far as I can see. What happens when you try to edit <url>?__label__2 How many 1600x1200 images are you talking about? Are you asking how to speed up the internet ? __label__2 I ' m surprised no - one ' s mentioned calzone (unless it ' s lurking under an alias). Am I the only one who eats this when I ' m in the States ? __label__2 <url>. Can you tell me if this date is for the arcade or Wii version ? __label__2 DRM in eBooks is driving me mad. Can we please please please hurry up the free market on this one ? __label__2 I have also used WP : RM for Norway attacks. Which one would be faster ? __label__2 I don ' t thing there ' s ready made solution to that. Maybe some machine learning algorithms ? __label__2 PCB = Printed Circuit Board? As opposed to mechanical parts ? __label__2 @Henk Holterman, I knew someone would tell me this. But what else can I do ? __label__2 I cannot understand the exact question, but if you want to define something like Petri nets, why don ’ t you define your object by describing the difference from Petri nets? What is the difference between your object and acyclic Petri nets ? __label__2 @Peter Smit: What do you mean in your comment about "latex processing"? What did you expect to happen that didn ' t ? __label__2 Apropo WTL - is there an atlernative supproted by MS that would allow to build lightweight, single file (no additional dlls to distribute) binaries in c++ ? :-) Or even c# ?__label__2 what output do you expect? is it something like `1 2 3 4 \n 5 6 7 8 \n 9 10` or `0 0 0 1 \n 0 0 0 2 ..`?__label__2 Actually, the page I am looking for is more like the equivalent of ''<url>'' here at en : wiki. Do you know of such a page at nn : wiki ? __label__2 I see you originally created this article, so maybe you can sort out what looks like some confusion. The article says that it was created by Diotisalvi, and that the church was known from at least 113, but the <url> article says that he worked in the second half of the 12th century, and created the <url>, which started in 1152. Did he design both ? __label__2 I think a separate security section heading is required in <url> article as it gets prime billing in the introduction, but then has references (and criticisms) scattered throughout the rest of the article. Do you support this ? __label__2 That ' s why I am confuse..though if I think twice, O ( m * n + n), that should be the worst case. What ' s your opinion ? __label__2 In regard to your point - I ' ve tried to find where does it shows that working in the company is not relevant to the deletion discussion. Where can I find it ? __label__2 with that much data have you hit your db limit? are you on full sql ? __label__2 it is proven that there is no close formula for n>=5. do you mean you are looking for a numerical approximation ? __label__2 Sorry, what does "set your exposure such that that is 'properly exposed'" mean? Visually comparing the result of the camera with the colour of the card ? __label__2 A very excellent question. As a corrolary question, how do you taste your seasoning on a hot dish / sauce without burning your tongue ? __label__2 Very well. However, since the cartoon and Fleewtay version ''don ' t'' have an article, perhaps they should be mentioned on this page or given articles of their own ? __label__2 It ' s not very clear what you need, since TeX adds automatically `\hfill` at the end of a paragraph. Would you please add a "real life" example ? __label__2 Where are you take String text? Is it long / short ? __label__2 Since all of the balls have a box to be put in, all organizations have the same point value, right? Or am I missing something ? __label__2 Quite. Do you know why, though ? __label__2 I ' m talking about UI design. Should I use the MapKit framework; or, is there a third - party framework that you could recommend ? __label__2 Ok, you are now an admin on the Wiktionary and Wikiquote, but I can not make you a sysop on a wiki that doesn ' t exist, so you ' re not one at Wikibooks yet. Are you sure it is sensible to create three new projects at once in this language ? __label__2 Actually, I think the only problem with linking the characters like this is that the underlining can be kind of distracting and the page can get a little harder to edit. I wonder if there is some way to modify the Wikipedia software so that Chinese characters would automatically link to their corresponding Wiktionary page ? __label__2 Thank you for your comments. May I refer you to <url>, where I think you will find the sort of criticism section that you are looking for ? __label__2 Additionally I would like to ask the proponents of a unified citation style to answer this: Which wikipedia policy is this proposal based in? Which of the five pillars does it work to bolster ? __label__2 To be honest (in my experience) those tags are quite likely to stay <u>forever</u> - because people actually fixing things is a very rare event.. If you want to see a better article is might be quicker to just start cleaning up one .. maybe then others might take it as an example of good practice ? __label__2 The first attrib / value pair in your example data reads: `Name="value,` (the value is missing the closing quote), and the last attribute / value pair has a properly quoted value which includes an escaped quote. Is the first one with the missing close quote a typo ? __label__2 please can you add to your question the results of the following: `sudo lshw -class network` followed by `rfkill list`. Also - what happens if you deactivate the B43 driver and activate the STA driver ? __label__2 I don ' t think it ' s just that "if I was" *can* be valid for the past -- "If I were wrong, please forgive me" sounds totally ungrammatical to me. (Am I alone in this..?)__label__2 do you want something non - alcoholic? Or is some other alcoholic beverage acceptable ? __label__2 If this were lisp, the solution would be to use map: (map + '(100 100) '(2 3)) => (102 103). Maybe Ruby has a similar function ? __label__2 It would be cool if we had 3 answers and "permit" edits to add or expand each as time goes. Does that violate the GSE policy ? __label__2  " what is actually possible" is interesting thing. and does it means if we don ' t harvest , it get wasted in heating air ?__label__2 I got some rather heated complaints that your userpage contains about three "fair use" images at the bottom of your userpage. Can you look into it ? __label__2 What Models do you have in your app? are these items stored under a different model ? __label__2 Can you describe the content of the flash application? From the question, it sounds like it includes multiple HTML files, and not just a single .swf - is that correct ? __label__2 I don ' t think removing that info is the correct fix. Just change the punctuation.. OK if I do so ? __label__2 @David: okay, if you are taking your definition this strictly then the answer is much simpler: you cannot enforce the condition $\dot{\phi} = 0$. Why would you think you can do that in *these* coordinates in the first place ? __label__2 Please clarify what you mean by "tab through the four entry positions"? Perhaps you are using a smart editor (like emacs auctex) that examines your preamble and does some kind of intelligent autocompletion ? __label__2 @rob - Are you trying to clean off dirt, grease, or both? Or possibly sand and road salt ? __label__2 Well.. actually it is <nowiki><!--commented--></nowiki>. Could it be visible ? __label__2 What platform are you on? What programming language are you using ? __label__2 See <url>. I ' ve made them, can you help fill them out and place them in the articles ? __label__2 I sent you a Christmas message via e - mail. Did you receive it ? __label__2 That ' s an interesting question. How do they do it for the flavored beans that you can buy ? __label__2 Which version of Perl? Is it a system Perl ? __label__2 This kinda seems like a recipe request to me. Is there something other than bad spinach that you ' re trying to solve ? __label__2 Need more details please. Presumably you are making your own marshmallow from scratch? And you are referring to store - bought "food colouring" as "synthetic coloring agents?"__label__2 Could you recommend a good sump pump and battery powered backup sump pump ? __label__2 Can you describe in more detail what you set up looks like, what type of layers? Is there any difference if you switch to WinForm ? __label__2 There have been several frustum / aabb culling code questions recently; would some expert make a definitive how (not why) guide that shows the steps e . g. how/ *when* to make the frustum, what transform to use on the things to test etc ? __label__2 Sorry that does not answer my question. My question is, why do not people study electrons, say, artificially confined on a scale compared to the size of the nucleus ?__label__2 I think there is probably a very useful question underneath this, but as it stands this is quite subjective; some individuals may worry more about one or the other (or both) but that might not be useful for you at the end of the day. Can you reword the question more towards specifics ? __label__2 I don ' t think it should be tagged as a multiplayer game since that isn ' t given by the OP - it could be human vs AI. And by 'type dependency', are we talking the classic rock->scissors->paper->rock type thing ? __label__2 This looks useful. Please can you tell me more details about measuring the size of the saved box ? __label__2 Hello, I ' m just wondering how you have found out all the birthdates for the Coronation Street characters? Does it say somewhere ? __label__2 Find the shortest path. If there are other paths of the same distance, find those as well ? __label__2 Hi I saw you mentioned that DirecTV has plans to add MSNBC HD upon launch on <url> but the source you referenced has nothing about DirecTV in it, its just about the HD launch itself, so I removed it per <url>. Do you have a source that specifically says DirecTV WILL add it upon launch ? __label__2 thanks for that, but can you please elaborate? What are the three different class types ? __label__2 inBounds does just what you said, in my real implementation I dont use a visited array instead I use an integer and set bits in O ( 1) time to track what nodes have been visited, hence I said for the purpose of this assume copyOfAndSet is an O ( 1) operation as to not complicate the algorithm. Does that make sense ? __label__2 @Gumbo - I could only find a way to 'vote' to close it. Is that what you meant, or as the author, is there some way I can just close it ? __label__2 What is this line graph that you mention? Are you saying that the smaller graph is always a simple path ? __label__2 How is the copyediting going? Do you still need a copyeditor ? __label__2 is there another transparent view in front of the right 1 / 3? Or maybe your button has been moved outside of it ' s parent view ' s bounds ? __label__2 @bit - question, is this exact citation? Could you please give a reference ? __label__2 I see we ' ve been reading the same article on <url> years. Can you address my question on the talk page ? __label__2 But it ' s not really suitable for its own article, either. Do you have a better place to merge it to ? __label__2 Hi, yes I love your stats tool too. But could it also cover wikiversity and perhaps the other sister projects ? __label__2 make a c program to echo a php script? something like that ? __label__2 I would be interested in whether there is any impact to the life of the battery based on charging using one method over the other. Any suggestions or links ? __label__2 Replied there. Should we keep it in that one place for now ? __label__2 I ' m finding that I ' m not able to access any of the DPL - related pages on the Toolserveru2013I get an error message or a blank pageu2013but somehow the Dab Challenge results are still being updated by your bot. Do you know what ' s going on ? __label__2 What permissions are you using (i . e. 755)?__label__2 I rather got on my high - horse at <url>. Perhaps you can take a peek and tell me if my intuition has gone astray in this case of interpretation of <url>?__label__2 2 . 1. looks like it is testing that pj is in the "interior" of the convex angle defined by pi - 1, pi, pi+1. In that case, can ' t 2 . 2. be modified so that it tests that pj is in the "exterior" of the convex angle defined by pi+1, pi, pi - 1 ? __label__2 What have you tried? Where are you finding a problem ? __label__2 I also spoke to <url>, who wanted a lot of the WW2 information. I am just wondering if I addressed everything you talked about or is there more that needs to be done ? __label__2 If you live in Oslo, you probably know this better than me, but I took a look at <url> at trafikanten . no and it seems that line 1 still operates to Bergkrystallen during the rush hour. Can you check this out and if necessary restore the line 1 links to the affected station articles ? __label__2 Assuming I don ' t have a masterlink, I assume I ' d need to use a chain tool. (One of my multitools has one, I think.) Does pushing a pin out weaken the chain, or am I worried over nothing ? __label__2 Thanks, just for me to understand this in depth, "tumbarse" can not refer to the breaking of waves, or the waves coming roling in, "las olas se tumban" etc, but ONLY a beach chair? Is that what you are saying ? __label__2 I have unexplained pain. What do you think of this <url>?__label__2 What ' s the error? In what function, in what library ? __label__2 Please clarify your question. What does "This results in windows 7 with the following icons" mean ? __label__2 Can you load the console app and see if there are any relevant Finder or backupd error messages under 'All Messages'? Nice profile pic btw - reboot ? __label__2 What are you constructing a path for? XmlHttpRequest ? __label__2 @Tomalak Geret ' kal "extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet" - Do you see yourself asking this question, or a similar one somewhere in the future? Do you think people will find this page searching with a search engine ? __label__2 According to <url>, links are permissible as part of your signature but be sure to check the "''Sign my name exactly as shown''" box. What happens when you load ''<nowiki><url><url> (<url>)</nowiki>'' into the signature window and check the box ? __label__2 What type of application is this? WebApp, Console, WPF, etc ? __label__2 Hi - I noticed the same, and was wondering how you do it! I ' ve been trying to get <url> next to my name by default and I can ' t seem to manage it.. any help ? __label__2 If you took them and don ' t mind if anyone can use them for free then you should probably upload them on <url>. However, it depends what the pictures are of, what is in the picture ? __label__2 Yea, that one crossed my mind. It didn ' t seem like the best rails - y way, ya know ? __label__2 how are the cross sections given? polygons ? __label__2 After your subtraction, isn ' t the sign bit of the result exactly what you want? You should be able to shift that into your bitpack, right ? __label__2 M, I think we should put back the section that was archived yesterday. What do you think ? __label__2 Where is labelHashTable declared? Is it a file - scope (global) variable ? __label__2 I was reading the article reverse overshot wheel, but I can ' t find anything about the "reverse" part. Can you expand this ? __label__2 @TheHorse: I posted a DP solution paper which solves it in O ( f ( n)*8^n). Does that answer your "what if" question? :)__label__2 Have you tried deleting and reinstalling the app?? or Clean and then build./??__label__2 I see you ' ve created the page <url>. Are you by any chance related to the Hondo Hurricane ? __label__2 I don ' t know anything about relational algebra, but "having" is just the same as "where" except it can apply to an aggregate of a set. Is there any reason the relational algebra would differ ? __label__2 I believe that I tagged that right; it ' s got the full episode credentials and the TV station whatever notice. Anybody want to check on that for me ? __label__2 Google could just be going off of a cache. Do new posts appear ? __label__2 Rann, Redmond, 2010 election all currently in vandal wars. Can I request temp protection ? __label__2 It looks like you have done considerable work on <url>. Could you add at least some references to the article in keeping with <url>?__label__2 If you want I could simply remove the maps from each article, its not that important. What do you think ? __label__2 An anon IP has added "Mhxf3r - Roinn" to the infobox of <url>. Would I be wrong in thinking that is is a literal translation of "mainland" rather than a Gaelic name for the island ? __label__2 Hey, out of curiosity, why is your name "TruthbringerToronto" if you ' re in Montreal? Former Torontonian that escaped perhaps ? __label__2 @skywaddler. Sorry, but I got to ask for clarification: In your terminology, do you distinguish between a _function_ and a _functional_ ?__label__2 Are you okay with a server - side solution that resizes images on the fly based on get parameters passed to an existing image URL? Apache / Mod _ Rewrite ? __label__2 What happens if you replace the `` in `Vicen` with a `c`? Still have this problem ? __label__2 What is the `ArrayIntStorage& AIS` parameter? Is it relevant to your question ? __label__2 I ' ve just noticed I wrote "It ' s possibly the most ''possible'' incident in his life" for "possibly the most ''important''", so I may be more caught in the toils of flu than I thought. Check I haven ' t done anything stupid, and smooth out the text ? __label__2 Please tell us you ' re not trying to write a root - kit. Can you explain your scenario so that perhaps we can suggest a better security architecture instead of one that is generally considered "evil" behavior ? __label__2 If the struct is redefined, then everything that uses it ' s definition needs to be recompiled. Is there a rebuild of all modues that know about the struct ? __label__2 How turn - key do you need it? Can you add your own features to a base plugin or do you need all the features written for you ? __label__2 Perhaps if you are making a presentation about different possible equations, and wanted to use the bullets to indicate that they aren ' t equations meant to be satisfied simultaneously? (That is, using the itemize environment as formatting to communicate something like logical disjunction?)__label__2 What is a List? an std::list ? __label__2 Merci! Should the template page be updated to show how to list the article ? __label__2 I love "official journalistic decision". Do journalists make the rules ? __label__2 I ' m intending on creating a list of Crash Bandicoot locations. Do have any advice for me ? __label__2 Basically, I agree with you. <url>, right ? __label__2 I ' d like to see this tidied up, but I ' m not quite sure how. Perhaps close it and ask a new question more along the lines of "how can I safely ride faster" or "what techniques will help me stay on the bike at high speed"?__label__2 @Steven: Sorry, don ' t follow. Can you elaborate ? __label__2 Since this came up in another question, is there a UK equivalent for what we in the US call "biscuits"? The Cookies -> Biscuits correlation is listed above, but what about Biscuits -> ??__label__2 It might help to know what language ( s) you are using. Also , it ' s a bit obvious but: you _have_ checked that the DLL in question is being built with debug information and that your deploy / publish process uses the debug version of that DLL ? __label__2 So putting them in separate declarations is fine? I mean can we actually use auto in anyway inside a struct like I showed in the example ? __label__2 I tried to edit this as best as I could, but I ' m still really confused as to what you were asking. Could you please clarify the intention of this question ? __label__2 What do you mean by bare - bones? Supporting nothing, but A lookups? :)__label__2 The question is, which do you think would be easier? Port the C# code or implement the algorithm (second link) from scratch in Android ? __label__2 Which water temperature? The tank, or the outlet water temperature ? __label__2 @bobince I ' ve found several SVN software which one should I use? Can you point a link ? __label__2 what is leftborder and rightborder? positions inside the string ? __label__2 Could you be a little be more specific. Where do you make the changes (in what project / module) and where don ' t you see them ? __label__2 how are you resolving function pointers? I am also writing similar kind of program but still wondering how i will resolve function pointers ? __label__2 It ' s not hard to, say, brute force this in Prolog, but the performance will be horrible. Does anyone think this has a PTIME solution ? __label__2 What is the pixel size of your JPEG file? Of the generated icon ? __label__2 In the infobox for <url>, the "Website" link which points to "The Stratton Audley Village Web Site" redirects through http://ww . strattonaudley . com/ to the <url>. Is this acceptable ? __label__2 Minimum number of pictures per card, or minimum number of pictures given that there are 8 per card? Also, does every picture have to be matchable ? __label__2 When you call the C++ program by itself, does it return the desired output? I . e., `./PyTest Hello, world!` returns `Hello, world!`?__label__2 how are you creating the buttons? in interface builder or through code ? __label__2 I haven ' t been lately as I ' ve been pretty busy in real life. Is there something you ' d like me to check out ? __label__2 Hi, how are the revisions going? Do you want me to take another look yet ? __label__2 Looks like Illustrator CS4 can be scripted with JavaScript, VBScript and AppleScript. Would be nice if you could get your hands on the script they used to create these ring maps, huh ? __label__2 Cool, so you understand what "subst:" does now? Btw, eh, where are the section edit links on this talk page ? __label__2 Looking through the discussion page history, the addition was made by <url> who is still active on wikipedia. Why not try a message on <url>?__label__2 Will expressions always be unambiguously parenthesized like that, so you don ' t have to deal with precedence? Or is `X OR Y AND Z` allowed ? __label__2 yea, that code was crufty.. see the latest edit. it is still crashing when accessing the new array..perhaps the \0 characters are getting lost in the shuffle ? __label__2 What is your take on the Simpson ' s images problem ? Should I remove them from your user page ?__label__2 These are getting tagged as orphans and stubs. Are they SIAs, do you think ? __label__2 What browsers does it not work in? Have you tried IE / FF / Chrome ? __label__2 You will probably need a licensed refrigeration mechanic to gas up the lines, and there may be licensing involved in giving it power, but other than that, you could DIY. Don ' t most places that sell them offer installation services, too ? __label__2 Your current code would load page . php ' s content into the `<div id="test"></div>`. Are you saying that, within page . php, there is code to run testit _ 1, and on page _ 2 . php to run testit _ 2 ? __label__2 If you add bbcd to the list, then some of your items will have no unique characters. How will this affect your goal ? __label__2 So you just want to get "any" element from a set? Or you want to check "if a given value is inside the set"?__label__2 @Omega Centauri - I think that strictly speaking, levelized costs are normally for *energy* rather than *power*. Anyway, can someone with the rep please move to close this question, as it ' s speculative ? __label__2 I have attempted to address your concern. Could you take another look at the article ? __label__2 @Chad Agreed. But can we make it CW ? __label__2 Good stuff. Do you have diffs for your direct questions to Betacommand ? __label__2 Yeah, sorry, that ' s how I wrote it in the code but it was a mistake in my comment. Any idea why could this be caused?!__label__2 Is it a non - self - published, peer - reviewed source? Is it cited by scholars as reliable ? __label__2 I assume the citation you added recently to <url> was from a website. Can you add the URL, publication date, and access date ? __label__2 Does it have to be exact, or is it also OK if e . g. 900 out of 100 selected are among the closest 100 ? __label__2 @nikic, its a WordPress site on HostGator. How can I tell ? __label__2 no but isn ' t it the correct named route for the index action? Isn ' t that the url that I want to pass to `.tokenInput()`?__label__2 If she ' s a 40 year old virgin, she ' s probably also an employee. Wouldn ' t that be against policy ? __label__2 What do you mean by "tracing letters"? Could you give an example, please ? __label__2 I ' ve done a PHP wrapper but don ' t have enough reputation to edit it in. Could someone link to it ? __label__2 Works for me under "This is perl, v5 . 10 . 1 (*) built for x86 _ 64 - linux - gnu - thread - multi" (Ubuntu 10 . 04 . 1 LTS). What is your exact host, perl version, is this the complete code ? __label__2 The effect of these edits has been to circumvent policy and process to move the above article to non - verified, non - English article names without a discussion or consensus. Who will put this right ? __label__2 Which call to Print fails? The first call ? __label__2 3 . 5 . 0 . 52 ExtendScript 4 . 1 . 23 ScriptUI 5 . 1 . 37. No errors.. weird huh ? __label__2 Hi. Wouldn ' t you say that creating a <url> instead of just "in Europe", and functioning as a subcategory of <url>, would have been a better solution ? __label__2 Hiya FFM, I want to update the <url> page to make it a proper article and perhaps get it to FA status; I know it ' s unusual to be part of one ' s own organization editing, but it is possible -- if we work on a draft in userspace and have friends / colleagues helping update the article proper. Are you interested in working on this in the coming week or so ? __label__2 Oops. Hmm..yeah..that sounds like a good idea..why not go ahead ? __label__2 What is container? What is the number you get with `container . getWidth();`?__label__2 Are you after an optimal solution or is a near optimal solution good enogh? And is hyphenation allowed ? __label__2 Did that string come from an attribute? Or the content of an element in XML ? __label__2 I ' ve got some. Want any of them ? __label__2 What is the default value? Can you just set that to 0 when you create the array ? __label__2 1) Is this XML or HTML tags? 2) Is there a definite structure to the XML ? __label__2 You ask 'how much quicker'. In what unit of measure, exactly, do you want the answer to be in ? __label__2 I ' d rather not discuss matters by email, if it ' s avoidable. Is this a confidential issue that cannot be discussed on talk pages ? __label__2 What about the code of the view? Do you get error messages ? __label__2 I want to use an already existing encryption algorithm, so how am I designing this from scratch? I need to add somekind of code myself though to actually use this algorithm, right ? __label__2 Unless you have only a few big groups, enumerating all of them will likely take way too long. Could you add more details ? __label__2 I am wondering about one thing. Is there a risk of flat tire on rough terrains or even breakage or tears on such tires ? __label__2 @Gareth - No answers yet. Perhaps you can publicize this question by linking to it on randonneuring / audax forums ? __label__2 Incorporation sounds like a good plan to me. I guess we need physical signatures for that, not just people typing in a wiki page ? __label__2 More likely than not it has to do with the way visual studio optimizes the loops. Can you post the generated assembly ? __label__2 I probably would have gotten to Sinnott and Simon eventually, but I started to feel like I was abusing the peer review process. :) Did you see my note in a section above about another user who likes to work on comics creator articles ? __label__2 I suspect so - though with the size of things it may be best to assess each one individually. Using the formal name of the region was copied from the London category which had already been started - maybe we could add disambiguators on an individual case by case basis ? __label__2 Can you please paste here an example of what you have done so far? Have you tried doing a dpm() or error _ log() on your custom theme override to see if it ' s getting called ? __label__2 Do you want them one at a time, maybe alternating chars and ints, or do you want a parameter that tells how many to generate? What do you want to use the randomly generated values for ? __label__2 An error I can see is that you have defined a field called author and set a field called user. Is the posted code what you actually ran ? __label__2 What about a function like safe _ free ( void* ptr) { free ( ptr); ptr = NULL; } or something like that? Or what about some kind of struct wrapper and functions to manipulate it ? __label__2 You get to name the row and field sets explicitly, i . e. you don ' t have to specify a contiguous rectangle in a fixed coordinate system (particular row and col permutations)?__label__2 What are you trying to do? I don ' t know how to embed an image like this in another way but I know lots of ways to get data into a webpage so maybe we can figure something else out ? __label__2 Have you looked JavaScript libraries to manipulate SVG, e . g. d3 . js: http://mbostock . github . com / d3/ or isn ' t that what you want ? __label__2 Can you review your <url>? We might disagree on what constitutes "played in a fully professional league", but surely this one meets your criteria ? __label__2 Your input data does not seem to have all the fields that the Google format requires. Where are you intending to get the missing data from ? __label__2 Automating in what way? What information do you want to extract ? __label__2  [ Google Image Search](http://ww . google . com / insidesearch / searchbyimage . html) does this to an extent. However, there seems to be no API for this (yet?).__label__2 Grappler - I ' m not sure if this article is OK now or not. What do you think ? __label__3 Please be a little more specific! did you install it in an unusual way or is it just a "normal" Ubuntu package ? __label__3 @Qiang Li: okay. Is this question drawn from a specific programming challenge ?__label__3 argmax on what? A function, a dictionary ? __label__3 This is most likely OS specific. Which operating system are you using ? __label__3 I personally don ' t think templates such as that are that good but this template connects a lot of different categories and articles together to try to grasp a huge subject . Have I made my idea clear ? __label__3 Mainly about Diane and Janine. Even if it ' s for an episode or two, Don ' t we usually re - add their names to the cast based on their existing history with the show ? __label__3 Zero has taken a break from Wikipedia, and RK has recused himself from editing controversial articles. Why don ' t you and I fix up the <url> article now ? __label__3 Do you have POI ' s in your system ? or are you hoping to use maps to do that as well ? __label__3 Try installing a JRE (e . g., `apt - get install openjdk - 6 - jre`), possibly the one from the 10 . 04 repo, _before_ trying the full upgrade. Does it work ? __label__3 Why are you subclassing UIScrollView? Why don ' t you just add subviews to it ? __label__3 For solving an algorithm you have to now how the data is representeded. In this case.. how do you represent the rules and in what kind of data structure are they stored ? __label__3 Is there any downside to using a profiler? Are you worried about it giving you more information than you can handle ? __label__3 It states on the page that it features her, they sample the song, and were going to try and get her to take part in the video.. Surely this counts as being featured on the single ? __label__3  ( a , b , d , c)? Are you sure ? __label__3 @Milo: I ' m confused about why you have a non - overrideable function call a virtual function rather than directly calling the virtual function. Is there a reason for this ? __label__3 Also, someone suggested merging it with another hoax page. Why wasn ' t that option considered ? __label__3 As far as I ' m aware it should work correctly. Could you provide an example ? __label__3 Must it be dependent? Is GuiceFilter dependent on the container ? __label__3 Is this homework? If so, could you please tag it as such ? __label__3 Sorry, I know you wrote this awhile ago, but could you explain what the last part about electrostatic vs. electromotive means ? __label__3 Still not clear what you mean by saying static or dynamic. In that array you can push values, remove values, change values.. so what exactly are you trying to achieve ? __label__3 Do you know which line it exits from? Can we see some code ? __label__3 Why do you need to compress it that way ? Do you need fast information retrieval once the data is compressed, it is a question of memory ?__label__3 See the page <url>, and in particular the section <url>. Does that make sense ? __label__3 Are you trying to write a standalone program to invert matrices or write a `transpose` function as part of a bigger program? If it ' s a standalone program, how is your program supposed to get its input and output ? __label__3 The history section appears to be copied and pasted directly from somewhere. Is this a copyvio issue ? __label__3 <font color="green">''Replied''</font>Yep, that list seems to include ALL ships launched that year, so that work out just fine. By the way, what exactly is the notability of this ship ? __label__3 I ' d have done it in half the time if I knew how to format cites, so might have had time to copyedit too. Now I need it moved to the correct title - where ' s a friendly admin when you need one ? __label__3 What has this got to do with the article? Is this in the right place ? __label__3 no.. depending on the flag count, i wanted to print the values of flag.. the first case should print aa and the next case should print aa , bb , cc. is it possible to do that in a single line of code ? __label__3 I saw you changing a block ' s duration to 99 years. Isn ' t that as good as indefinite ? __label__3 Who is authorized to perform sockpuppet checks? Is there an automated service for doing it ? __label__3 Does the empty tile have to obey the normal rules? I . e. if placed, it has to stand in lieu of the same letter in both directions ? __label__3 That sounds to POVish to me <url>. What do you think ? __label__3 Can you expand <url>? From what I gather the Dorje Ling nunnery is part of the monastery complex ? __label__3 What do you mean with evenly? Outside evenly brown, or inside evenly done ? __label__3 What method *serialized* a `Boolean` to "true" and "false"? Or are you simply talking about producing a `String` from a `Boolean`?__label__3 $G'$ does not seem to add anything to your setup, as it is simply a forest of cliques. You seem to be asking about the average connectivity of $G$, but what is the distribution of functions ? __label__3 How many recipients is "mass"? Also does it need to be a 3rd - party service ? __label__3 The format here is Q & A and this is just an A! I know I ' m being a bit anal but could you split your solution into its own answer (using the button near the bottom) and refactor your question into a question, please ? __label__3 By the way the list schools was in wikimedia code. Or is there another way it should be done ? __label__3 But the main question was that would it be a bad idea to make more articles about characters, orginizations and etc. in a book ? __label__3 I see you reverted another image move back to below the accompanying text. Your summary was "add to discussion" - can you explain ? __label__3 Your recent post to the straw poll at <url> may need some clarification. Did you intend "support going to Arbcomm" to be a vote for the "Death" entry ? __label__3 But if you change something for your entertainment, if no one catches that, it will misinform someone else. What if you go to Wikipedia to learn something, but someone has put in false information ? __label__3 thank you, that ' s it. can you please help me how to save it like 1bit png ? __label__3 And the result of your first action is return in your second action ? Why don ' t do a redirection ?__label__3 How do you get a runtime error, if you got a compile time error? What did you change to get it to compile ? __label__3 This is basic C++ syntax. Are you learning from a [good introductory book](http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 388242 / the - definitive - c - book - guide - and - list)?__label__3 I note the copyvio tag you placed on <url>. How do readers compare the content at the source you specified with the content of the article text you removed ? __label__3 Sorry, no clue. The help desk wasn ' t helpful, huh ? __label__3 Is this okay? Or OTT ? __label__3 That ' s not how Shoulda worked when I tried it out. Care to show us some code ? __label__3 I note you also removed the statement that "Hurrell had been involved in previous altercations". Why ? __label__3 Are there also $2 bills? If not, where do the 2 ' s come from ? __label__3 Thanks. Is Brazil4Linux doing anything particully bad right now ? __label__3 Much slower? Did you switch off 'String Format Checking' switch in compiler options ? __label__3 How do you save it??__label__3 I don ' t really understand why this question is so heavily downvoted. Is it because of the patent thing ? __label__3 A background image for what? How is the image being used ? __label__3 The links that I added were detailed images of all the aircraft that was listed in each entry. How does that make it spam ? __label__3 It ' s amazing how selective our memory can be. How ' s the project going along ? __label__3 I have to ask, why are you separating topics into different sections? And was I right in my edits to <url>?__label__3 Sorry , but i dont know where are these project properies. Could someone tell me ? __label__3 Keeping a list of everything bad user : XX did in your user space is neither constructive nor appropriate. Perhaps we should both focus on the many positive things to do rather than the very occasional misbehavior ? __label__3 I hope it is `NSTimer * eventtimer`. And how have you declared the method ? __label__3 That ' s very odd, since the pedal is just 2 months old. Hopefully Wiggle will send you a bolt, but then I suppose you ' ll have to explain and prove the bike didn ' t fall on that side ? __label__3 You could simply use a bunch of XML files in a zip file, and whatever file extension you want. Why the verylongtagnumbers??__label__3 You ' ve given lots of details, but have not clearly asked a question. Are you interested in knowing why you aren ' t yet appearing in Google search results ? __label__3 Is there a particular reason you need it in binary format? Could you not use simple text output ? __label__3 You say you declare `class myApps`, you go and declare `class myClass`, and in the other file you declare `class MyClass`. Is this the exact code that causes you the problem ? __label__3 why the downvotes? are the code golfs forbidden now ? __label__3 Are you absolutely sure what kind of chip it is? Are there sites that let you search by pin numbers ? __label__3 Is this a quiz? Do you know what the flaws are ? __label__3 I ' m linking this to Fumiyo ' s. Are <url> and <url> among the bullies too ? __label__3 Same here. @germanus Can you provide more information ? __label__3 I very much disagree that the article that was deleted was advertising; I have never bought anything from his store as a matter of fact, but I do know that his is one of the most used online Judaica shops out there. What can I do to make the article acceptable ? __label__3 `sudo` was updated to version 1 . 7 . 4p5 - 1 . fc14 on January the 17. Can you check with `rpm -qi sudo` which version (including release) you have and also include the output of `yum -v repolist`?__label__3 do you ever build without debug, e . g. a release config ? __label__3 Sir i think u hav many friends on wiki who can review articles well. can u pls consult any of them ? __label__3 ok so, 100 arrays.

But my question still stands, Why did this work locally, and not on Heroku ' s server ? __label__3 Also, what happens when you compare 15 Jan to 10 March? 3? 2 . xx ? __label__3 Your URL does not appear complete. Can you please edit it ?__label__3 @bear any gps enabled device. any recommended api ? __label__3 What do you mean by "reset the database back to its original state?" Does this mean you want to erase all of the data ? __label__3 It looks like you ' re not null terminating your `argv` array. Or is that just left out of your example ? __label__3 Assuming the domain of the hash function is larger than the range, that ' s impossible. If it ' s not, why bother using a hash ? __label__3 Da ti mene nisi sa nekim pobrkao? Kakve ja veze imam sa tim Faust Vranu010diu0107em ? __label__3 It just doesn ' t make sense (to me) that we use a manga spelling for one name but a Simmons' spelling for another. Can ' t we just go along with Simmons on this one ? __label__3 Well perhaps I am "out of touch". Can you please point me to where a new consensus has formed on this issue ? __label__3 I just sat through last Sunday ' s horror show.. The less said about that the better.

He ' s only done one nonsense page so far: is the name similarity enough to block as a sock ? __label__3 I ' m not trying to be obtuse, but is what you ' re saying in essence that if we cannot tell whether an award is utterly trivial then that uncertainty becomes sufficient assertion of notability to not apply A7? So if an assumption needs to be made, or discretion employed, A7 doesn ' t apply because the assertion of notability has been made ? __label__3 Define the quality of traffic. What makes traffic "quality"?__label__3 Bump. Anyone have any idea on this ? __label__3  " Overmans believes that the figure of 473 , 00 deaths listed in the 1965 German Church Service study is incomplete and not a definitive accounting of losses in the Expulsions" ?

Does it return `true` when you guess is less or equal to the answer ? __label__3 Is this homework?

What do you think ? __label__3 I ' m not reaching the point of your question. Aren ' t you being able to deserialize the data ? __label__3 I just occurred to me yesterday (while playing with the Bushnell 7x50 Marine binocs I got for my birthday), that the <url> section on rangefinding reticles might be worth its own article, if for no other reason than that rangefinding reticles are used on other optics, such as said binoculars (which have a compass and 5 milliradian graduated reticle) and some other specialized items, such as golf rangefinding monoculars, which use the standardized height of the flag as the known size item. So what do you think--is there enough content in the rangefinding section to make a standalone article, and do I provide enough argument to justify pulling it out, and adding links from <url> and <url>?__label__3 I agree this is subjective, but on the other hand I think this is a good topic to talk about. Perhaps if we elaborate a bit on the "why" part in the answers, it might be generally useful enough ? __label__3 I just have the first (german) edition of the Sedgewick - there this assignment is not in. Is that the exact and complete wording, or is there additional like "and in case it is not possible proof it"?__label__3  " Say I want to estimate a large number of parameters" this could be made more precise: What is the framework ? I guess it is linear regression ? __label__3  " I + have" = proper agreement; "she + is" = agreement; "she + would" = agreement. Am I missing something ? __label__3 Posted to <url>. What category are you talking about ? __label__3 No actually the problem is that there is NO such header as iostream . h 1.#include <iostream> 2. instead of main() wwrite int main().

Understanding where the soil and stones are coming from would be the first step to understand how to prevent the soil and stones from building up ? __label__3 @zengr Ok. Why are you requesting that people enter their entire URL, instead of just their ID ? __label__3 what database is this? SQL Server ? __label__3 I assume you can code a balanced tree as a data structure. Why is forking processes interestingly different ? __label__3 I second George. Can you elaborate your problem a bit ? __label__3 I believe it was I who moved it, based on what appeared to be consensus to use the hyphen in that context. Where is this guideline of which you speak that suggests otherwise ? __label__3 "..in Mauritanian Ouguiya, it ' s اوقية‎0 . 00!" - Wait, Mauritania has an app store? :)__label__3 I couldn ' t find your source.

I see you semiprotected this before: fancy doing it again ? __label__3 I ' ve heard Greeks pronounce the name of the letter ''I'' as ''yota''. What do you intend "giota" to sound like ? __label__3 Sorry, I ' m a newbie in Physics world. But since you said that it ' s always with other stuff, can ' t we just weight the whole bundle of ' em (quark with other stuff), then if we know the weight of other stuff, do simple math ? __label__3 You ' ll have to give more information such as: what type of data are you rendering? do you have complex loops in your erb ? __label__3 I really want to know some context for this question. Why would you ever need a word for someone who loves frogs ? __label__3 Either way, the whole point of the question was to see a concrete mathematical proof. Instead of just saying it is so, can you please show how it is so, such that I can learn more ? __label__3 Presumably follows on from your previous question http://stackoverflow . com / questions / 4983820 / excel - functions It was suggested in the answers to that question to use `=MAX ( 0, SUM ( A1 : A5))` to replace a negative number resulting from a formula with zero although the `SUM ( A1 : A5)` part seems to have been given as an example rather than as part of your requirements. Do you actually have any need to look at the range `A1 : A5`?__label__3 In fact you did link, and the user has archived the page and gotten rid of it. Do you know which section he should be looking for ? __label__3 If it is always complete using numbers from 1..N you could just write the values 1..N to the input array. So I ' m guessing thats not going to cut it ? __label__3 Have you considered performing a simple test measuring how long it takes your cold water to boil versus warm water ? __label__3 My guess is he memorized all the WP shortcuts a while back and has either forgotten them or they ' ve moved.. strangely, this is teh 3rd or 4th time he ' s linked to the wrong WP policy, but still somehow gave the correct summary of the the point he was trying to get across. silly, or strange ? __label__3 I ' ve removed the reference, but if you are attached, you can put it back. Can we remove these comments ? __label__3 Web Apps? How about Meta Stack Overflow? :)__label__3 Maybe you can clarify what you meant by "legal action" then? Perhaps you just meant as opposed to illegal actions ? __label__3 Could you post the image, or part of it along with the colours you ' re trying to apply and what actually happens to the image? (is it the whole image that changes colour or just the colour you ' re applying that ' s wrong?)__label__3 Bumpity bump. Anyone else have any thoughts on this ? __label__3 They all used to be dabs that linked to other dabs which are now housed in the pages I moved them to, so I don ' t think there ' s too a need to restore them. Also, I eliminated the "4th of July (song)" redirect as there was only one page linking to it; no use for a redirect if nobody is going to it, right ? __label__3 4 bytes will only limit the keys if you ' re actually trying to uniquely encode the VIN into the 4 bytes. Do you *need* uniqueness ? __label__3 Surely to embed HTML5 into another site that site has to be written in or support HTML5. Or am I missing something ? __label__3 <url> has a discussion (well kinda right now, I ' m still waiting for the initiator to actually explain himself) about the fair use strength of images on episode lists (why there and not on <url>'s talk page is beyond me. Care to chime in ? __label__3 Why are you putting control characters into the string? And don ' t they count to whatever length limits apply ? __label__3 I don ' t understand the problem exactly.

I ' m guessing it requires 10 . 6 ? __label__3 What is it that you are trying to achieve with this regex though? What would you like to do with it ? __label__3 I tried <url> and it worked for me. What articles did you try using it on ? __label__3  [ MultiseatX](https://help . ubuntu . com / community / MultiseatX) gives you independent displays, but there ' s no easy way of switching input devices between them and I ' m not sure if it ' s possible to mix X and console. What if you just ran X normaly with a fullscreen terminal on one monitor ? __label__3 @bigp - Trying to nail down your definition of "evenly distributed". Do you mean the distance between consecutive points is constant ? __label__3 From the description of the problem alone, I ' d go for a series of if statements. What makes you think you need an algorithm ? __label__3 Take a look at the most recent post to <url>. Can you make a stub out of it ? __label__3 OK, maybe I only started noticing it after that incident. Do you have diffs for your earlier opinions ? __label__3 I know that this has been discussed before by various editors, but can anybody give me a reason why the problem is normally formulated in terms of the door numbers (1 , 2 , 3) and not the objects behind the doors (the car, goat 1, and goat 2). Is this just because the door are given numbers in the problem statement but the goats are not given names ? __label__3 @henchen: Sorry to ask, but doesn ' t an extractor suffices? Why are you considering hash functions ? __label__3 What about the whole "Heroes as personal feifdom" trip?

Do you mean there are no empty lines, or no newlines ? __label__3 Laboriously went to the trouble of downloading XCode3 and IB, and when I open the XIB, the key paths are missing. Can XCode4 not properly save keypaths in NSPredicateEditorRowTemplates ? __label__3 I know there has been an issue with wrong Brazilian chart data being added lately. Is <url> adding the correct data, or could it be the same user with a dynamic IP address ? __label__3 This deleted page was recreated. Since you were the original nom., is this basically the same article, or has it been improved ? __label__3 You need to look SciPy for Ironpython - See http://pytools . codeplex . com/ for more information.

Can you post it ? __label__3 Like most users with their articles screwed over by <url>'s new web facelift, I ' m at a lost with <url> being dead. Can you help ? __label__3 It looks like those news sources are all poker blogs. Are there any that meet <url>?__label__3 By revert all user contributions, do you mean ''all'' contributions? or just all contributions to one article ? __label__3 I have left the Kuznetsov as <url>, because that is the name of the ship, translated, and Admiral of the Fleet is a rank. I wouldn ' t like being labelled a Captain if I were an Admiral, would you ? __label__3 You said a user can ' t be blocked until their last warning.

Cuales son los articulos que mas te interesan a vos ? __label__3 OK. In the future, can you kindly post a note on your userpage, talkpage, or somewhere else so I know that the bot isn ' t broken ? __label__3 the amount of time you might end up spending trying to figure out a noisy power supply might offset the cost of picking up an adjustable power supply, or even a decent single voltage Meanwell (or similar) 5VDC power supply. That said, maybe an LM6805 or LP2954 will do the trick ? __label__3 Which discussion are you referring to? On which article ' s talk page ? __label__3 Maybe the bot needs to begin adding a source. The least that could be done would be to add a hidden comment next to the passages in the articles to alleviate confusion; who is going to look at other city articles ''just to make sure'' when they are sure that there is a problem that needs fixing ? __label__3 Homework? Can you post what you ' ve tried ? __label__3 What do yo mean by sum to 100%, given that your first is well over 100.

Perhaps you could reevaluate your stance on the article, and see if you feel you could change your position in the current FAC ? __label__3 Sorry?? Which comment are you referring to ? __label__3 OK, but `$node->body` is an array yeah? Can you just print it out like that ? __label__3 What should I use on <url>, if I do choose to you money. Should it be dollar or pound ? __label__3 Yes, a `<table>` is the right choice here. Have you tried writing any code yet ? __label__3 @user2924 - I must be missing something but I ' m unclear still what you mean by *"like this"?* Can you also please specify your basic requirements ? __label__3 Can you determine if it ' s a software or hardware issue? What happens if you boot into the Mac OS installer, or some other bootable CD ? __label__3 Hi, J . delanoy, I was just wondering why you did <url>. If in your opinion that text shouldn ' t be there, why not just delete it completely ? __label__3 What ' s wrong with Wireshark? In general, what "seems not to fit"?__label__3 Your datatype is Datetime or Date or Varchar ? Sql Version ?__label__3 Firstly, I think we ' re gonna need to see some source for the page you ' re having problems with. Secondly, have you tried a "View source" on the resulting page to see if there ' s anything else in there ? __label__3 And where do you host the script? In a VPS ? __label__3 Hi, as the creator of this article, this made me nervous until I saw it was reverted. Can you tell me what was that all about ?__label__3 Things are going to break if you get rid of the `.Designer . cs` file. Why do you want to do this ? __label__3 did ' t you just ask this on the Ubuntu Forum? Same person ? __label__3 Would somebody please explain what does emacs graph, given above, means? How to interpret it ? __label__3 Seeing this problem with a bit of perspective, an idea would be to embed bibliographic metadata in PDF files. Maybe biblatex can do that or can be made to ? __label__3 <person>, with whom you discussed linkspam in 2006, has returned. Could you offer your views on his talkpage ? __label__3 I don ' t want to risk the drive using truecrypt, It has too much important data. Any other solution please ? __label__3 does it have to be a C# example? can it be vb . net ? __label__3  " real life examples"? You mean like spotting an xvalue in the supermarket, or wondering whether your car can be classified as lvalue ? __label__3 Ok. Thanks TTGL. Are you like my handler or mentor now ? __label__3 Even with big arrays, loops should not take much time. What ' s taking time I guess is comparing objects.. Could you be more specific ? __label__3 time is a timestamp to make different IDs for each object. This code gets executed when a box is created, so the selector is the name of the box which has just been created, what do you mean by every possibile selector ? __label__3 Geeky and Cool do not coexist? :P What ' s Google then ? __label__3 that is 'some data'? any hint ? __label__3 Both get across the same thing.. the first is prettier. But, you at least agree with my edit removing the redundancies, no ? __label__3 Maybe the ip adress is blocked??__label__3 Well, the Synopsis section of the module shows you what to do. What happened when you tried those examples ? __label__3 What about `DefaultListBoxItemStyle`? Are you sure that isn ' t the culprit ? __label__3 Meh - perhaps not, and they will most likely be closed as renames, but I figured another week to allow anyone who wants to to comment wouldn ' t hurt anything since you as the nominator were the only one who had commented so far. Is there something I missed, or a hurry to get these quickly renamed ? __label__3 Ok, so [1 , 2,..,N] is not allowed because it is a run itself. Then how about [N,..,2 , 1]?__label__3 Talking about this subject, I noticed that you supported showing a link between Dacian and the Baltic languages - but questioned whether this meant they were part of the Balto - Slavic group. Surely, they would be part of the group by definition, since are not all the Baltic languages descended from proto Balto - Slavic ? __label__3 Also I do not think that the constraint if you have a choice you always prefer right to forward, and forward to left is well - defined. What prevents you from turning right 100 times before starting ? __label__3 Doesn ' t this presume that the wall thicknesses are the same? What will it mean if they are not ? __label__3 @Deepak "key path"? What ' s that ? __label__3 You should provide more information. If your site has an URL like http://example . com, how can a URL like https://twitter . com/#!/AlaaBatayneh / status / 72020345695109122 be set as path for your node ? __label__3 You created <url>, there is already a page that similar <url>. Why don ' t you mix 2 articles together ? __label__3 Why design a config file syntax that is very difficult to parse? Why not just set the relevant bash variables and source it ? __label__3 Sorry, but which talk page? I came across the graphic at <url> - is there another ? __label__3 Is the bot correct and if so can I assume that is the standard to follow ??__label__3 I ' m really bad at problems like that, but if the int - stream is randomized data and you know the min and max (MAX _ INT?) creating a simple tree is automatically balanced if the root is MAX _ INT / 2 ? __label__3 Transmission monitoring already existed as an answer. Could you please describe more the iTunes watched folder function ? __label__3 isnt `tested` same as `i`. I that case will the `while` ever complete ? __label__3 Latest version (now on Commons); all placenames included but still needs some tidying up and tweaking. Comments ? __label__3 So you ' re trying to use remote debugging? Have you set that up in VS 2010 ? __label__3 Do the titles of WP articles generally pass partisan judgment on the subject under discussion? Should they ? __label__3 Can you run it? Do you have a MIPS board or an emulator or something ? __label__3 So an occulation chord passing through the equator of the asteroid is equal to the diameter of the asteroid? Does it matter that the Earth is only passing through the penumbra ? __label__3 Why are capital letters used in the article title ''<url>''? Is this a proper name of a particular proprietary software package ? __label__3 You should probably clarify what kind of framework you ' re talking about? 3D Graphics Framework ? __label__3 Anyone? Any ideas ? __label__3 What is your specific problem? How to transfer the data between pocket outlook and your application ? __label__3 Yes, it certainly could be. But why thre read() does not realize immediately there ' s nothong to read, but waits for 1 / 2 seconds ? __label__3 Anyway, if you feel that strongly about it we should at least add a summary. Whats you think ? __label__3 What virtual machine software are you using, e . g. QEMU, or VMware ? __label__3 It seems like the bot hasn ' t made any contributions in quite a while. Is something wrong ? __label__3 clear about when the inverse exists. Is there a formal theorem that would apply ? __label__3 This was virtually all copyvio. Carry out your earlier merge proposal and just add it to Cree language, turning the article into a redirect ? __label__3 Can ' t you just generate the HTML code in a manner that marks the blocks which can be hidden with divs? Why are you bound to that representation ? __label__3 In its current form, the question is too open ended and basically does not provide enough information for a relevant answer. Could you explain your situation a bit more ? __label__3 The question asks how effective fluorescent clothes are during the day, and should he stop buying those tops for his daily commute. Please can you answer this a bit more specifically, rather than focusing on night time visibility ? __label__3 I never saw his press conference. Is there a clip of it online ? __label__3 Fair enough. So when can I change it back without getting blocked ? __label__3 I don ' t mean to sound argumentative, but asking the question, did Britain not have the capability to repair aircraft carriers during the second world war ''is'' connected to the article. If it were true, could it not be added to the article ? __label__3 I ' m not totally sure what you mean. Are you asking for a list of all featured articles on the English Wikipedia ? __label__3 P m i meetin teddy & snowy today??__label__3 Hoping that the good people at Conservapedia haven ' t tied you to a stake yet and you ' ll be back to witty banter at the MIT page ( s) sometime soon. Or otherwise enjoying a wikibreak ? __label__3 I think you have a point - but are these dishes popular with Indians because they are easily identified as vegetarian ? __label__3 The fellow is giving me a hard time there. Could you please comment ? __label__3 Define brute force. Ar you OK with iterating all values of `A` starting from 1 and trying to find `P` in `O ( 1)` for each of these ? __label__3 Works fine here. Have you tried to download it again ? __label__3 Unsuitable? How so ? __label__3 I ' m curious, are you stopping at characters? Or will you eventually move onto season pages and the main page itself ? __label__3 Problem isn ' t too hard; I ' m taking care of it. Had you discovered <person>?__label__3 I suspect some of your surface area suggestions might be right. Do you have an example of this we could critique ? __label__3 I dunno, that ' s what the vandals seem to think. And who are we to doub them, being the considerate, mature, thoughtful people they so often are ? __label__3 He ' s still at it, and stating that we can ' t stop him as he has not got a static IP. Can you at least block him for now ? __label__3 @marknt15: Sounds like a poor design to mix "arbitrary XML - like tags" with real HTML. Where are you putting this text, that the HTML is dangerous but the arbitrary tags are not ? __label__3 PHP is not made for long run. Why do you need it ? __label__3 Which operating system are you running VS . Net 2010 on / running the program on? Is it a Winforms, WPF or another technology application that you ' ve created ? __label__3 Ya. Now I am understanding the problem. But what is the correct way ? __label__3 This really just boils down to "You ' re used to Windows." doesn ' t it ? __label__3 Huh I hadn ' t thought of that. That is strange isn ' t it ? __label__3 Glad it ' s fixed. What ' s a sensai mechanic ? __label__3 Are you asking about preparing a presentation (e . g. using Beamer), or preparing a "notesheet" that is simply a guide for yourself as you ' re talking ? __label__3 Before I prod this article. Do you want to save it by adding some independent citations to it to say why it ' s important independently of UNE ? __label__3 What is not working? The speed or any of it ? __label__3 You could always repartition and then restore /home from backup. You do have backups, don ' t you ? __label__3 But that ' s just the same as `where user _ id = 6 and food _ id=2 and type=6` - ie matching all three criteria, so that no rows from your example will match. Are you sure that ' s what you meant ? __label__3 So, how was my edit <url>? Thinking the page could use a few more tweaks ? __label__3 Is the server side going to be written in Java or Python? Will a simple database on the server suffice or do you need to perform much game logic ? __label__3 What shell? bash ? __label__3 Firebrandt, could you please explain the motivation behind this question, i . e. why are you interested in this question ? __label__3 Do you want everything in between `Begin` and `End;` of the procedures / functions as well? Or are you only interested in the names of them ? __label__3 Personally I think (much) longer gallery captions are probably the answer; these are probably easier than working each image into the text. Didn ' t that work at s**-p**?__label__3 I am not sure why <url> is not just in the article <url> as a straight table. Is there some chance the template might be used on another article ? __label__3 does you function return the first n elements? is that a requirement ? __label__3 Well, I haven ' t seen a lot there, but the pages that I ' ve seen were sourced. Does this mean you consider a sourced article in Wikipedia also unreliable ? __label__3 Shouldn ' t <url> have 2010 as his final year? It ' s pretty late into 2011 to be getting fired, but as I understand it, his navbox should read 2010, and then whatever coach takes the lead for this season will be the interim, no ? __label__3 What does "wrong" mean? Can you give an example ? __label__3 It ' s not the sort of pot I ' ve ever seen used in tea ceremony--they tend to be iron or metal and designed for holding plain hot or cold water rather than tea, which is prepared directly in bowls. Perhaps the <url> page ? __label__3 @dustin Ok, do you want me to just close that question and merge your other account into this here then (ie. merge dustin - http://stackoverflow . com / users / 783534 / dustin - into this one here - dustin ledezma) ?__label__3 Reading symbols from /home / uranus / project / cvmat / cvmat..(no debugging symbols found)..done. while i compile source files with gcc -g option, how that happens ? __label__3 Ta, can tell its cold here - I thought I was putting the message on your talk page and then realised it was indons, and the similar spurious etymology and anecdotal rubbish is at ratu bokos palace as well - had found a brilliant article on ratu boko in BKI but mislaid it anmd havent gone back. There is a means by where well documented folklore can stay on an article page if the editor knows of the correct texts to qoute re folklore and spurious etymology or geneology in java - but if there is no acknowledgement of the academic / citable ways of exlaining I say that such addons are ad hoc and worth the chop and message to user 'this is an encyc' - watcha think ? __label__3 I have the iPhone 4 but do not see API Keys at the bottom of the screen. Has this capability been removed ?__label__3 I responded to you on my talk page. A pity the WorldCat proposals you posted met with such deafening silence.. but can we claim that as implicit support ? __label__3 Just had a look at <url>, and oh dear god. Any interest ? __label__3 What good is that number of partitions to you? Do you need a number or actual list of transitions ? __label__3 I know <url> is one, what about <url>? Shouldn ' t it also be a primary topic or are there actual rules which discourage practice of "all caps"?__label__3 It is incredibly unclear what the actual question here is. Is it just "what do you recommend for clustering / replication / failover options?"__label__3 I replied.. also, are you watching that page? If so, I will stop bothering you here ? __label__3 So even though the article says that there are 16 primitive Pythagorean triples with c < 100 there are actually 32??__label__3 What platform? VisualC(++)/gcc / ANSI C ? __label__3 lovely answers here, but isn ' t the diameter twice the radius of a circle ? __label__3 The status changer is broken because wputil can ' t find the edittoken. Neither can I actually, where is it stored ? __label__3 could you mark fluchtpunkts answer as accepted? so that people can see by one blink that your question is solved ? __label__3 Target platform is OS X. @Bavarious What alternatives ? __label__3 Why do you have 0 , 2 after 2 , 1 and 2 , 2 (and 3 , 1 before 0 , 3)? Why is 1 , 2 in twice ? __label__3 @zaf look at the picture here: http://i . imgur . com / 22yAQ . jpg , perhaps slightly more rotated. How can you fit such a rectangle inside this one ? __label__3 Why do you have to use goto for this? And if you want to ensure that both are initialised, isn ' t it easy enough to move both declarations to the top of the function ? __label__3 I don ' t understand the system there. What does bold mean ? __label__3 Hey, so your move of this, and wanted to point out that the reason I put a disambig title on it, was because there are two different labor unions of the same name, either one of which could wind up with an article. But, I don ' t know that that means the article should automatically get the title, is there a standard for this situation ? __label__3 as I said "sudo -u apache perl _ script . pl" works. unless I forgot some flags in order for it be the exact emulation ?__label__3 Paul, I tried to email you to discuss this offline, but Google claims the email address in your profile is invalid. How can we contact you ? __label__3 I did notice your initial post to my talk page, but five minutes later it was removed by <url>. Is this a shared IP address ? __label__3 Iu2019m flattered that you have changed the meaning of minor in my honour, but I havenu2019t refused to engage in debate. What would you like to talk about ? __label__3 How is the complex number c given to the Turing machine? Are you considering in terms of Turing machines over real / complex numbers ? __label__3 Is this the headset microphone or microphone - microphone? Or could you link to the product ? __label__3 please define "medium" & "large" sized holes. And are you talking about timber members ? __label__3 @AndrejaKo - Electrical **fields** are 3 dimensional, yes. But a 3D **wave form**?__label__3 I have done every thing you have asked and I have attempted to gain a better understanding of how to do this in the future. Please tell me exactly what I can do to prove my ownership ? __label__3 What does "OP" mean? Does it mean "operator"?__label__3 Would you be happy to accept my painting of a certain landscape then, if I was a good enough painter? My sketch of a certain bird, if I was a good enough sketcher ? __label__3 You asked for help? What help do you need ? __label__3 The problem remains that I don ' t know where to turn to educate myself further on the matter. For instance, where would I find the Tao - Green paper you mention in the article ? __label__3 I ' ll carry on keeping a watching eye on <url>. As a matter of interest, why do you nowiki your signature ? __label__3 Is this your photo? Is this the tall tower that ' s in the downtown area ? __label__3 True, and you ' re right. But it does define it, so doesn ' t that mean it shouldn ' t have a comma ? __label__3 considering this is homework, I assume you also have a class and teacher. How far have they gotten you and now what is your specific question ? __label__3 Is this just a confused marketing statement? Or can you point us to a product that does this or a use of this notion in the wild ? __label__3 What ' s your question? Do you want to parse the entire record, understand the format of RRULE lines, something else ? __label__3 Yes. What about ''Q''&times;''Q'' with the L<sup>1</sup> norm ? __label__3 That ' s nice. May I ask why you noticed this ? __label__3 A few questions: Do you know the number of elements in the sll ? __label__3  " promised to the client without my knowledge" .. I feel your pain. Would an arcobjects solution be acceptable ? __label__3 How can an Action take a fixed amount of time (Action . time)? Shouldn ' t an Action ' s time be dependent upon the time it takes to accomplish each of its Tasks in Action . dependencies ? __label__3 Why the removal of the citation dealing with coriolis? Was the proof not within the citation, or was the citation not considered primary ? __label__3 Yay! Homework! But, what have you tried so far, again ? __label__3 I don ' t see a connection between the <url> and the <url> articles that would warrant See Also links between the two. Could you explain that to me ? __label__3 Hmm.. I don ' t know about this one. Can you give a use case ? __label__3 Yes I did. Did you happen to check out <url>?__label__3 Please declare what your relationship is with HomeSpot. Are you the owner ? __label__3 Can you describe *awkward result* a bit more detailed? Also, how many images to you have ? __label__3 You only need one "=" on the third line. Is that a typo or did you copy paste ? __label__3 @Steven: I don ' t know how good WordPress is with future revisions of already published pages. Can you save them without publishing them, even ignoring the permissions issue ? __label__3 i took the photo, and if the kludgy licensing template would allow me to license i would. do you actually fix things or tag spam ? __label__3 @Noctrine I sincerely appreciate that. :) @Frederick Imbeault Can you share a link to the article you read ? __label__3 After reading I still cannot figure out the question you are asking. Are you looking for "SCO Unix printing conventions"?__label__3 Why nominate this for deletion? It was obviously created by someone who didn ' t know how to use redirects, so would it not be best to just correct it ? __label__3 It look like <url>, is going to be on the Featured Content page. Where is the page that list what is on there when in the future, akin to the FA main page nominations page ? __label__3 Dlaczego usunu0105u0142eu015b ze sku0142adu Kas ( z?)aka ? __label__3  " with a vary of 0 or 1" doesn ' t really parse into something comprehensible. Rephrase ? __label__3 Do the scales overlap to some extent (i . e. shared constructs across the questionnaires)?__label__3 Hi, why did you remove <url>, <url>, <url> with <url> ? Do you think we ' d better put them into article directly ?__label__3 Do you have different PHP versions in Eclipse and on your server? Also different error reporting settings ? __label__3 Well, yes, obviously (but I sort of assumed that the same exemptions would apply to 1RR as 3RR - is that not the case?) Should I self - rv ? __label__3 Where is the source that Sotero was non - practicing Muslim? Doesn ' t going to mosque to prayer constitute practicing ? __label__3 Who is going to contact all of the users?

And perhaps this fits better at Code Golf ? __label__3 What is the most common way to spell the first paragraph of an intro? is it "lede" or "lead" or something else ? __label__3 It ' s been 2 years since <url> was semi - protected.

And you wish to access the web page using java app ? __label__3 Stephan, I am Deborah Byrd, producer of the Earth & Sky radio series, and I ' m looking for a reference for this statement of yours on the discussion page of the article about scientists who oppose the mainstream view of global warming (http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Scientists _ opposing _ the _ mainstream _ scientific _ assessment _ of _ global _ warming) "We are not talking 51% or 60% or 75%, but rather 95%+ (or "near unanimity in the peer reviewed published literature and in official statements by professional scientific organisations"). --Stephan Schulz 08 : 26, 18 November 2006 (UTC)" How did you determine that there is 95% agreement in the peer reviewed published literature and in official statements by professional scientific organizations ? __label__3 You and <url> are getting quite close to an edit war. Perhaps you should talk it out ? __label__4 @Smjg, thanks. But why did you also remove the categories I added ? __label__4 The sources are ref ' d in the article. Can you be more specific ? __label__4 That ' s impossible to say without knowing your reason to consider a change. What are you looking for ? __label__4 This doesn ' t make sense. Do you mean "introspection"?__label__4 Not reproducible. What is `EnvironTypes`?__label__4 @David, No, I don ' t. Why do you ask ? __label__4 If the community decides that you no longer speak on its behalf--if the Wikipedia community decides that this supposed ban does not apply to constructive comments on AfDs on articles for which I am a major contributor, and that I may make such comments without asking for permission beforehand--who are you or anyone else to override that decision? I ' m not saying that anyone has or will make that decision--but if that decision is made, are you claiming that you are entitled to do what you want regardless of community consensus to the contrary ? __label__4 Did you already ask this question? But i think the file path for tabify could be playing up??__label__4 this is now the fourth question about the same addcube() function. perhaps there is a larger issue here that just indices ? __label__4 Nothing jumps out. You *did* restart VS after copying the visualizer, right ? __label__4 What is your source for the PD Seantors? There is no news on RTE, ireland . com or the PD website ? __label__4 What is the purpose of implementing your own framework? Why not use an existing one ? __label__4 Hmm, page says you are unavailable right now. This means you wont be fixing up <url> any time soon ? __label__4 As you may have seen, <url> was also blocked for the same time. In the light of his pledge to stay away from the article, can you give me an assurance that you will not be disruptive ? __label__4 It ' s not clear that this is a programming question. What are you looking for ? __label__4 Please clarify your problem. Are you looking for some P2P solution, or want to play with the IP header ? __label__4 Really? When / where did that happen ? __label__4 Not trying to pick a fight - a user that reverts all articles to a version by you is suspect. Any New Year ' s resolutions Will ? __label__4 What is the source of this image? and why do you think it ' s PD ? __label__4 There cant be a general solution. What do you do when the stack has 10 entries and you need to output a number, but the last number hasnt arrived yet ? __label__4 The last sentence looks a little contradictory. Does it copy your generated config and then overwrites it ? __label__4 To me these two bits of TeX look identical after they ' re rendered. Can you explain the advantage of the latter format (since you ' ve made a point of changing from the first to the second form in some articles)?__label__4 I am bewildered as to why anyone should think that they are "representatives of the people". They are not elected, chosen, delegated, or in any other way appointed by the people: how are they representatives of the people ? __label__4 When I try to edit the article <url> I ' m refused to save my edit due to a "Blacklisted Hyperlink". What ' s wrong ? __label__4 If you do it once, you can keep using it again, and again, and again.. In any case, "looks great" is really a subjective thing. Can you be more clear on what you actually want ? __label__4 How can a permablocked user edit? And who would set up a sockpuppet months in advance ? __label__4 You are talking about direktor, right? He begin the edit war again, as seen by diffs, so C was blocked instead of direktor, see ? __label__4 @DisgruntledGoat: Yep!

Do you have the site set up to login when permission is denied ? __label__4 I notice you are still contributing to Wikipedia, but have not responded to my argument. Do you now agree with the argument I suggested ? __label__4 What are you asking? How to modify a stored procedure using SQL, or how to send a SQL command to the server ? __label__4 There ' s a comment saying "special case to return to 2" associated with the following code `if count == 2 and pattern [ count] == 1`. What ' s so special about that case ? __label__4 This looks suspiciously like homework. Could you elaborate a little more ?__label__4 How do you mean 'sorting a string'? Do you mean sorting a list of strings ? __label__4 No more saga! Help me by keeping this page the way it is right now, alright ? __label__4 A regular expression here seems like overkill. Why not just `explode('#','http://blah . com # removethis',2)[0]`?__label__4 <url> has been promoted to A - class. Shouldn ' t that score ? __label__4 Why are we reloading the page? Can ' t one manage all the data to be changed in a stream to the applet directly, or AJAX javascript ? __label__4 What I ' m trying to say is that I don ' t think this is really a valid question. You ' re basically asking "where should I store some files so I remember where they are?"__label__4 Okay. What, exactly, can I do about that ? __label__4 That ' s what I like in the interview questions: the question is theoretically interesting but I would be hard pressed to find a usecase within a minute. Seriously, who manages linked list explicitly ?__label__4 That Roambi looks neat. Do you have links to other similar apps ? __label__4 I have got a problem with your solution: the keys in your hashtable are not unique (if A[] = {1, 1, 1, 1} what is H ?). So how do you prove that H . get() is o ( 1) ?__label__4 I thought compilation warnings shouldn ' t affect the outcomes of compilation. Aren ' t there any additional error messages you that you left out ? __label__4 Also, you ' re not really asking a question by just posting some unfinished code - you need to be more specific. Is there something you don ' t understand about how the code works ? __label__4 I ' m wondering why in the <url> article, you keep changing the link <url> to <url> which just redirects to <url>? Why not just leave the link to point to the intended article directy ? __label__4 Sure seems to work for me on FF 3 . 6, Chrome 7, IE 8.. http://jsfiddle . net / x3MMA/ (added a console . log to test). Are we missing some details of the problem ? __label__4 why keep stuff that you don ' t access? why not leave the space for stuff that ' s needed ? __label__4 This is a standard homework problem for an undergrad QM course. Do we really want questions like this and answers to them on MO ? __label__4 If the llamas of Peru spoke Spanish, and one asked the other, ''xbfCxf3mo se llama?'', would he get confused ? __label__4 Bureaucrats require a higher level of trust than administrators. Are you actually familiar with what these tasks entail ? __label__4 Just wondering why removed death material? Perhaps another article on his death and circumstances- legacy ? __label__4 You really should give us more information. How does the user create an account for example ? __label__4 You didn ' t answer about the status of above mentioned image. Are you going to tag that image too ? __label__4 The computer may have multiple disks and multiple partitions, each one with one different file system. Do you want to know the type of root partition or what ? __label__4 you recently deleted <url>. can you tell me where is the AfD debate on that article ? __label__4 I would suggest you reconsider if using the `*` selector is a good idea. Maybe what you want to do is possible without iterating over the zillion elements that make up a production web page ? __label__4 The file was indeed locked. Could you please expand on how to identify the uchg flag in the ls output ? __label__4 Another sock down. How many more to go ? __label__4 Your question reads as if you ' ve already found a solution. What is the problem ? __label__4 In instances where there is one major usage of a name and several smaller ones it is conventional to leave the major one in the namespace and have a link in the top to the others (or to <url>. Surely 99 . 9% of people interested in <url> are going to be looking for the main one, so wouldn ' t it have made more sense to have left it there rather than making it a redirect ? __label__4 Would it be premature to remove the autobiography and list laundry tags from <url> yet? I ' ve been trying to improve it bit by bit, and everytime there are those tags on the page.. mocking me.. What ' s the go ? __label__4 Stating which model of MBP you have will help, as the architecture changes over time. Assuming Unibody, at least ? __label__4 Smells like homework. How far did you get ? __label__4 So I have no authority and am not the chief ed, but you have the authority to give me chances. Are you the chief ed ? __label__4 Please specify your Drupal version. Have you looked at Migrate module (http://drupal . org / project / migrate)?__label__4 Vi is out of the hospital. Did I mention that she was in ? __label__4 @Chzz, the coverage in the references provided are a dedicted chapeter and a reproduced artice??__label__4 @Ofeargall - Welcome to the community. Could you please elaborate on what you mean "want to know" vs "need to know"?__label__4 Pat, for someone who has died, you don ' t say "he is a former professional baseball player", you say "he was a professional baseball player". Okay ? __label__4 Well, you leaved me also curious. Why was it not appropriate ? __label__4 Because different different languages have different strengths and libraries already written for them. If I wanted to write lots of set up code for this problem, why would I pick a dynamic language, why not give myself more work and code in Java or C ? __label__4 You added the name Ken Taylor to the <url> page but there is no such person listed on the DOD website as having received that award. Who were you refering to ? __label__4 I understood just fine, but wasn ' t at my computer. Are you in a hurry ? __label__4  - 1: Huh?? Can you please explain ? __label__4 @Nightfirecat Well, the normal `<hr />` isn ' t enough contrast from the background to provide me with what I need. So, creating a 1x3 image and a 100x3 image doesn ' t really change the speed at all ? __label__4 Wait, I thought algorithms were named for <url>??__label__4 very unclear - what is it you want to do?? Upload images to a WCF service and store them in SQL Server ? __label__4 Are you calling me a vandal for visiting your user page? Or am I just <url>?__label__4 Yes, this is the English Wikipedia so we use the English version of the infobox. And can there once be a time when you don ' t find your way to my talk a complain ? __label__4 ", actually the application crashes.." We need the crash info. Is it a BAD ACCESS ?__label__4 Dear commander, this source: ''* Berg, Ole F.: <person>, Oslo 1997 ISBN 82 - 993545 - 2 - 8'' is a Norwegian source, as signified by the lang|no tag, hence the first letters of months is not supposed to be capital. I thought that tagging sources with lang|no would prevent this problem, isn ' t that correct ? __label__4 If she ' s been in a lot of porn movies, doesn ' t that show she is famous. Can ' t you undelete it and then let it go to a AfD discussion ? __label__4 you should probably explain the acronyms. Is RMQ range - minimum and RSQ range - sum ?__label__4 You seem to have an algorithm that works. What ' s the problem ? __label__4 What do you mean by "character"? The drive letter ? __label__4 Re: <url>: if it ' s eligible for Did You Know, it ' s by definition not a stub. Cool ? __label__4 I can ' t read IPA. Can you add the IPA meanings for those vowel sounds to the answer, please ? __label__4 I kind of agree. Are you planning on actually editing Wikipedia, or is your whole purpose here to promote this .. study (or whatever it is)?__label__4 What ' s the purpose of a Riddle? If you get some kind of reward, shouldn ' t it be a SpecialSquare also ? __label__4 Do you really want to parse both in the same context? What about things like "2 , 00 , 00 . 45"?__label__4 What exactly you need to do? Any examples??__label__4 It ' s worth noting that in some companies, the line between "design" and "marketing" is imaginary. What becomes of your question when the person who does design is also involved in marketing ? __label__4 @Eric, I feel sorry for anyone still stuck with an [ATM](http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Asynchronous _ Transfer _ Mode)-attached host. What did you do to the technology gods to deserve this ? __label__4 Sorry Less? What is that last postdirected at ? __label__4 Solve for `x`? Is there a dividebyzero . com in the SO family of sites ? __label__4 And what, may I ask, is ''your'' relationship to Hammersoft? How did you come upon this matter ? __label__4 Could you please block me indefinitely. If you can ' t then what do I need to do to get blocked indefinitely ? __label__4 I assume you like to play ''U . S.'' billiards bottom right corner ? __label__4 Are you sure it ' s not a worn chain, or chain ring (or both)?__label__4 Not writing a full blown DNS so reading never ending RFC is a bit boring. Or is that absolutely essential ? __label__4 Straightforward solution with iterating over sub - array to find an average, won ' t it have `O ( n)`? Why `O ( n^2)`?__label__4 What is the purpose of having two switches? Why not just calculate the time between pulses from sw 0 ? __label__4 Why are you attempting to do multi - threaded UI? What is the problem that can ' t be solved with single - threaded UI ? __label__4 Code snippet? What is failing ? __label__4 UTF - 8 files are text. What ' s this about an "image part"?__label__4 Too vague - explain what you expect the contents of the array to be afterwards - give a concrete example. Possibly also needs a homework tag ?__label__4 Stick it in dynamically from where? You just need it to be a global js var ? __label__4 Sorry :) I dont want to hack the system!! :) is there another way ? __label__4 Wait, my previous comment may have been jumping the gun.. What is it you ' re trying to do? Get access to someone else ' s record, or go for the bigger SQL Injection vulnerability there ? __label__4 This makes no sense :( Can you make a bare - bones project that reproduces this behaviour without giving anything about your project away? If you add the tap recognizer to self . view does THAT work ? __label__4 Well, what do your current results look like? Is the glow you ' re talking about from the high brightness images having spillover (ie, pixels that would be black or dim in faster exposures are accumulating more light from nearby light sources in the slower ones, throwing off the HDR processing?)__label__4 Why not keep the numbers in memory? Should be what, 100 MBytes ? __label__4 This is starting to almost feel like harassment. Perhaps we should take this to a mediation committee ? __label__4 Right, but thats 24KB when served via gzip, but on my file browser it shows 78kb. The other file should be MUCH LESS in size when served via gzip because its already 32KB as my file browser shows, no ? __label__4 I ' ve had enough of this. What would you think about filing a RfC ? __label__4 COI? What COI do you think I have ? __label__4 Please don ' t mention other languages when we ' re discussing the English wikipedia! Why are you limiting yourself only to the Abrahamic concepts of ''God''?__label__4 I don ' t repro this at all. What *exactly* do you type ? __label__4 @Dallaylaen _$ =~ s/::/<br />/g; Like that??__label__4 I am puzzled that you just deleted the file 'harry potter stamps'. This file seems to have existed for two years without deletion, so perhaps you could explain the grounds for speedy deletion ? __label__4 The Magix software doesn ' t work on Linux. Did you install it in Wine or do you mean a different application ? __label__4 Why are you trying to exchange data between component in the same system via a file? Why not use a temporary file to create a mock file ? __label__4 I am not sure what you are trying to achieve. Is it a non - convex hull that represents the shape of the point - cloud better than a convex one ? __label__4 Hi I noticed you speedied and article but not it ' s talk page? What ' s the use of leaving the talk page, discussion or no, if you ' re going to speedy the article ? __label__4 Delegates don ' t work!? Do you use Control . BeginInvoke() method to invoke delegates ? __label__4 But he ' s still a WHU registered player with a squad number. Is that really the right thing to do ? __label__4 Could you please clarify with an example? And are we doing your homework for you ? __label__4 Actually, that ' s again a misromanization. Would you ''please'' stop this insanity ? __label__4 Can I ask why you deleted this AfD as "A3: Article has no meaningful, substantive content"? It obviously did have meaningful content; was there any reason it couldn ' t simply be closed like any other AfD ? __label__4 @jtbandes - why learn C first? Would you say the same to a C++ questioner ? __label__4 What type of Lycra? Polyster or Nylon ? __label__4 If so, that ' s a hell of a perf hit to take just to show the user a moving progress indicator. Why not just show a spinning ball or similar while the file is copying ? __label__4 I ' m not going to get involved in the content dispute. But I ' m pleased to see you finally taking this seriously: its no longer ''all in good fun'', perhaps ? __label__4 I have just noticed that today a Wikipedia administrator added a POV tag in the u201cPsychohistoryu201d article, which you have contributed to edit. Perhaps someone should do a little work to balance the article and remove the tag ? __label__4 and the language of your choice is? and the form of your input is ? __label__4 Your code isn ' t going to work anyway. How can `tags` contain a new instance of the tag object ? __label__4 Ok, so if you can ' t fond the correct tires for your car, you ' ll prefer to re - invent the wheel? Won ' t you change your tire - dealer ? __label__4 @Henning Makholm- That does not seem obvious. Can you explain why ? __label__4 can you please add the output from the `add - apt - repository` command ? Also after running `apt - get update` can you please run `sudo apt - cache policy nginx` and post the result ?__label__4 How do you come up with 57? Are you allowed to divide by 2 ? __label__4 How ' s that even possible? Why don ' t you join the stdout to the logcat output and try to print that massive log directly on stdout ? __label__4 Your recent edits with Dab solver seem to be removing rather a lot of links, without mentioning this in the edit summary. Is this intended behaviour ? __label__4 Links to attack sites and so are not allowed. You must know that you violated BLP ? __label__4 Wikipedia is anything ''but'' formal, many characters real or fictional don ' t get referred by their full names all the time. Besides, who else on wikipedia thinks "OO" is awkward ? __label__4 Most of time such a question is a sign of bad design. Why do you need dynamically assigned variable names ? __label__4 Hey there; I saw that you took the time to edit the Valletta article, but didn ' t remove user Jasalf ' s edit. How so ? __label__4 Oh, and I checked your user page, as you requested. Perhaps you could help me understand why your "spouses don ' t confer nobility" argument doesn ' t apply to <url>?__label__4 The Field API is a very large section of the Drupal API. What, specifically, are you trying to accomplish ? __label__4 I am not sure of what you meant by "Robust Standard Errors are reported as a matter of course" standard errors of what? You said testing for "it" what is the test you are talking about ? __label__4 Career advice questions like this one are too localized for this site. Please see [Are Career Advice questions useful for anyone except the poster](http://meta . programmers . stackexchange . com / questions / 588 / are - career - advice - questions - useful - to - anyone - except - the - poster / 590 # 590)?__label__4 Indian cultural imperialism is rampant this am - what nxt? we have had the mongolians and indians - maybe the astragoths next ? __label__4 That ' s a strange description. Do you mean that the graph is a tree ? __label__4 I don ' t quite understand. Why don ' t you use ${resource} and pass it to the frontend ? __label__4 How is "17 : 18 : 3600" supposed to be understood? Is this a standard format ? __label__4 Also, 'topological proof'? Isn ' t 'proof' a bit strong ? __label__4 Reply: I have just found your edits to the talk page of the above article - not impressive at all? I suggest that you take this to <url> and explain why his edits need to be reverted and not yours ? __label__4 Just to be sure, are you talking about ST as found in clinical trials, e . g. http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Sequential _ analysis ? __label__4 Makes me wanna ask, what do you say about having separate articles like Wikipedia has <url> and <url> or <url> and <url>? Should this be tolerated for non - Transformers stuff ? __label__4 Drat forgot to sign. You blanked my talk page and asked if I don ' t like K ' s ? __label__4 I had that fixed before you oranged me, I swears it! :) Are you not familiar with the technique of doubling your edit count using typos ? __label__4 CIV, I ' ll grant (and yes, I shouldn ' t have). But how is it a violation of AGF to say that Stewart suggested the article be vandalized ? __label__4 but that won ' t work. - please be specific, why people should guess ? __label__4 He ' s back with yet another IP, leaving abusive and harassing messages on my personal talk page as well as here. Is there anything that can be done to end his disruption for good ? __label__4 Maybe it ' s necessary to phrase this another way: is there any food that *everybody* can eat ? __label__4 I have not seen quotation sections on any other Australian politician page. Also, who chose these "quotations?" What qualifies as a quotation ? __label__4 What signatures are you referring to? Could you please clarify your question ? __label__4 Be more specific, what actually happens? Can you give a link ? __label__4 Nvidia dedicated graphics chip? Could you be more specific ? __label__4 Why are you installing rubygems 1 . 3 . 7 and watir 1 . 6 . 5. Why don ' t you install a current version of rubygems and watir gems ? __label__4 I can ' t remember if I asked / checked to see if it got to you? So.. did it ? __label__4 -- Bit confused by your DYK nom. Surely the world ' s first gasoline automobile was created by <url> four years earlier ? __label__4 Good question, worded poorly. Might want to try rephrasing it ? __label__4  " Odder" in what sense? Also, why are you still delaying ? __label__4 I ' m going to walk you through this one very simply. Let ' s start here: Is there currently, or has there ever been a cartoon broadcast on television by the name of the Breakfast Monkey ? __label__4 What ' s wrong with the standard NBA style for the userbox template? Why can ' t the Thunder ' s box look LIKE EVERY OTHER TEAM ' S ? __label__4 Sorry to ask a stupid question, but.. What exactly is this thing ? __label__4 I don ' t think the name ' s gonna help much since whatever I ' ve played is going to be the Dutch translation. The cow shooting part had something to do with counting though, right ? __label__4 Short answer is yes. Did you want to know something more specific ? __label__4 The first step is where the magic lies, I guess. Care to elaborate please ?__label__4 Hell yeah. How do we do that ? __label__4 Isn ' t this section "Vatican Responses"? How come the wordings are not fact - based but seem to have devolved into media perceptions of the Vatican responses ? __label__4 That ' s a <url>-length rant. Still, be nice and AGF, okay ? __label__4 Your second code snippet is the same as the first. Did you not paste it in correctly ? __label__4 Show some code. How to you show the csv file ? __label__4 Yes, that was really necessary. What ' s wrong with establishing uniformity in CASH articles ? __label__4 When am I changing nationalities? I do remove flags when I encounter them per <url> and <url>, but changing them..?__label__4 @Adam: Thanks! Any suggestions / comments for the site ? __label__4 Why not bake the stew in a traditional container and roast the pumpkin separately, then move the stew to the pumpkin? Or don ' t even roast the pumpkin ? __label__4 I couldn ' t find your "email user" function. What ' s up ? __label__4 Could you clarify to which goto doesn ' t it go?.. What ' s the expected / real output ? __label__4 Binary shift? Divide ? __label__4 Language? Framework ? __label__4 I gotta ask..why would you replace your speaker wire once a year ? __label__4 Got another one: <person>. Can ' t someone with CheckUser abilities block the IP address ? __label__4 Oh, it ' s not that big of a deal. Drew, which IP edit did you consider to be "attacking"?__label__4 Turkish boys are circumcised they are Muslim ' s. Why did you delete it ? __label__4  - 1: A bad question. The real question is "how do I concatenate file names?"__label__4 Subukan kong ipagtatanong - tanong ang pangalan ng lola mo sa mga kaibigan kong native dito. Sa Tuguegarao ba siya / sila mismo o sa ibang mga karatig - bayan ? __label__4 How exactly is it unclear? The ships link to the same place, the prefix "HMS" comes before ''Eagle'' to show her name change.. what ' s not there that should be ? __label__4 Why are the results bad? Can you elaborate on what you did ? __label__4 You also seem somedeal similar to <url>. Not logging in is not sockpuppetry but do you acknowledge that User : 64 . 194 . 44 . 220 is you ? __label__4 Why did you just blank your userpage? It ' s not Wikisuicide, is it ? __label__4 It ' s simple Pumpie. Why don ' t you try to understand all parts, or write in your own language ? __label__4 Why not just generate the autocompletion configuration based on your YAML file? The options won ' t be changing all the time so why bother trying to make the autocompletion configuration dynamic ? __label__4 You changed the result here: Weu2019ve already had <url>; do you really want to do it again? The result given is a compromise; are you wanting to upset that ? __label__4 @Dan Dinu: is it guaranteed it is possible to identify who is a liar and who is a truthteller? should we be able to identify it is not possible ? __label__4 At the top of the page it characterizes a guideline as ''a generally accepted standard that editors should follow'' along with a passing reference to <url>. So, I might ask, how would using 4 tildes prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia ? __label__4 eigenvalues of what? of the image (as a matrix), of a correlation matrix, or of what ? __label__4 I ' m not sure about this, but I assume that in commercial yoghurt, there is a lot of sugar added. Did you add any ? __label__4 Serouj, you didn ' t reply to my message and my email. One question: if the church was built after 1700 but later ruin, for instance ruined by Beria order in 30s, can it be considered Contemporary ? __label__4 Given all the software tools out there (IDEs, refactoring tools, text search tools etc.) why do you want to write this from scratch yourself ? __label__4 I realize that. If Angry Birds doesn ' t make any provision for backing up and storing state data on the SD, how would a 3rd party app be able to over ride the Angry Birds state without over writing the information that I assume is stored somewhere in the /data/ directory (which you do need root to access)?__label__4 See my answer in <url>. Is there some problem ? __label__4 He ' s taken the notice down. Doesn ' t this count as belaboring the point ? __label__4 I am pretty sure SendGrid has this type of import and throttling build into their service. Why are you *doing it yourself*?__label__4 Nope. I can debug in my local IIS but I don ' t see the files anywhere ? __label__4 Have you ever been able to connect to a WLAN at all? Or did you never succeed ? __label__4 Your Frequently Asked Question is answered in the very first sentence: "perldoc -q match" --> "I ' m having trouble matching over more than one line. What ' s wrong?"__label__4 `data . find` ? no error ? __label__4 Btw, what ' s "WPC MOS", and where / when was it decided that we don ' t use volume indicators? Why is this, and how do we distinguish between different volumes of series when mentioning issue numbers ? __label__4 Charles River Media was acquired by Cenage at some point. I wonder if it ceased publication when that happened ? __label__4 PS do you really think that attrition is a degeneration? Surely it ' s the norm ? __label__4 I don ' t really get it. In your terminology, is there someone practicing Germanic paganism who is not a neopagan ? __label__4 See my comment on the talk page. How did this ever get to DYK ? __label__4 I ' m confused. Why did I get a user warning relating to this article ? __label__4 Nice tune Modernist <url>. You owe me one back ? __label__4 I noticed you deleted this while I was in the middle of creating it. Does the listing of it on the <url> not make it notable ? __label__4 And "..definitions..". What do you mean by "..definitions.."?__label__4 You ' re mentioned <url>. What do we know about these images ? __label__4 Why are you uploading / changing badge files here? Surely you should just upload them to Commons then list the wikipedia version for deletion ? __label__4 Flying is fun! What more do you need ? __label__4 Not too sure now you come to mention it. Do i need to annihilate it ? __label__4 Hi. I would argue that a consensus is far from being reached, so I ' m wondering why you have went ahead and starting changing links ? __label__4 Why can ' t it just be fixed? There are other tables on wikipedia that aren ' t working properly, perhaps nobody noticed ? __label__4 Well, you ' re ignoring all caught exceptions. Is an exception being thrown ? __label__4 Can you explain what you mean by ''"Randi, paranormal, Larry King etc. are all redundant redundant"''?__label__4 Yes, I had to wait about 18 minutes or whatever it was, in that time I forgot to come back and accept it. Do I always have to wait for these flood checks ? __label__4 Try to get the terminology right, there really isn ' t such a thing as POST and GET variables, especially not on the client side (which I assume you are referring to). So what exactly do you mean ? __label__4 What was your aim with <url>? have you abandoned it ? __label__4 You ' re right, but loosing it because of Devanampriya, of all users, would be quite a shame for Wikipedia. Don ' t we have to make a stand against ignorance, partisan POV - pushing and constant incivility ? __label__4 I state what I see when I read it. Are you and <url> the same editor ? __label__4 And what is the problem? Other than the missing semicolon after name [ 25]?__label__4 Could you post a small example code showing exactly which space do you want to reduce? Also which environment are you trying to redefine ? __label__4 You removed posts by me as well. Do you have any explanation ? __label__4 An important concept in Rails is REST and how websites should respond to requests. Why do you want to delete the ever useful edit route from that resource ? __label__4 I ' ve been trying to do the opposite: decrease the sensitivity below the minimum. Have you had any luck with your attempts ? __label__4 Where should he be? As a parent of Isa - Beg ? __label__4 umm, it ' s a soft redirect. A placeholder for a future page .. Is there a problem ? __label__4 I noticed you added the Jean Chretien link to the homepage, which is nice, but you didn ' t put any comment for the changelog and you also didn ' t bump of the last article, you bumped off the 2nd last article. Why ? __label__4 Also do you have access to the underlying data? How are the curves drawn ? __label__4 In `gconf - editor` you can use mappings to run custom commands (see `/apps / metacity / global _ keybindings / run _ command _ 1` and `/apps / metacity / keybinding _ commands / command _ 1`) If you have compiz, then this is better configured via compiz frontend. Have you used that for Alt+F1 > super . sh mapping ?__label__4 Nobody is actually addressing the question being asked here. Is it that vital to ensure the wheel is centered? Can it really be destroyed by riding slightly off - center ? __label__4 @Edward can you be more specific about what these three terms are supposed to refer to? Do you mean the machine running the software, the business that provides you the machine, or something else ? __label__4 Your question is unclear. Do you mean extract the addresses from each incoming email and save them somewhere, or extract all the addresses you ' ve ever sent or received anything from ever ? __label__4 What part of that is supposed to be case insensitive? The comparison with "Alaska"?__label__4 So why then does the lead stat in Christianity need a reference? Isn ' t it being contained in the article good enough ? __label__4 I never partook in this AfD. Did you leave this on the wrong page ? __label__4 Hi, although I agree with you, please check the following <url> in process. Why can ' t the darn thing work, in the first place ? __label__4 Huh, language agnostic God objects. Ironic ? __label__4 Hm. Am I imagining things, or does <url> seem familiar ? __label__4 What have you tried? Examples ? __label__4 What do you mean by "more sophisticated"? Functions that take word boundaries into account ? __label__4 I have no clue. Isn ' t there a WikiProject on radio stations you can ask ? __label__4 How ' s tricks, JRM? Lying kind of low, aren ' t you ? __label__4 That ' s basically what our members have said, not necessarily my opinion. Anything I miss ? __label__5 Stole ur flag for my page. that ok ? __label__5 And, no, I don ' t think that everyone who wrote a screenplay should have two pages, but I do think that every artist who has a substantial list of works which would clutter up their biography page should have two pages. Can you explain to me why the two - page thing is such a big deal when wikipedia is not paper ? __label__5 Right, but not all of it. So can you retrieve it or not ? __label__5  " Provocations"? How is it provoking to suggest to an American - expat that calling people in Taiwan "Taiwanese" is not controversial ? __label__5 Rather than tell me how wrong I was to close certain afd ' s maybe your time would be better spent dealing with the current afd backlog <url>. If my decisions were so wrong why haven ' t you re - opened them ? __label__5 Any reason for not using `print join '+', 1..3`? I mean it ' s golf, right ? __label__5 @Kerrek SB: Each string in the input is printed out exactly once in the output, with at most an additional comma to separate them. I don ' t see how that would come out to "pages", unless you are being sarcastic and there is something I am missing ? __label__5 Homework? Because there doesn ' t seem to be any other remote possibility in my mind why any sane person would want to do this ? __label__5  " It ' s my own program " - then, presumably you have the source code. Debug that ? __label__5 What about ''Race, Ethnicity and Migration in Modern Japan'' (Weiner 2004)? Or any of the dozens of books you can find on Google by searching Ainu+Honshu ? __label__5 Are the k in “k - CNF” and the k in the question the same variable? And what is the parameter of this problem ? __label__5 @RPM1984: its just so utterly wrong though! You seem like a smart guy, where did you get the idea from ? __label__5 Don ' t you think you should remove the welcoming plate of cookies you left at User : Dococe page??__label__5 You have been accused of sockpuppetry at <url>. Scared ? __label__5 And ? What is the problem ?__label__5  “ IE6 is deprecated” — by whom? Have you got a source for this ? __label__5 I haven ' t. What are you referring to ? __label__5 While this may not be your homework, you are essentially just asking us to write you code to solve this problem. Maybe you should do a Google search ? __label__5 ??__label__5 Sorry I should have asked it in more accurate words..yes I meant that it should be measured with respect to the aircraft ' s instantaneous position and not velocity.. Would the cross - track wind measurement / direction change if it was measured with respect to the aircraft ' s 'airspeed' velocity than 'groundspeed' velocity? -- as the cross - track direction is effectively perpendicular to the instantanous velocity of the aircraft -- whether measured wrt to ground or air -- so its measurement / direction would not be infulenced by the aircraft ' s velocity.. no ? __label__5 Please post the relevant lines from the log. Do you intend for these commands to run as you, or as root ? __label__5 COBOL homework? Where do they even do that?!__label__5 As a former administrator, and therefore a veteran editor who knows how wikipedia really works, I am actually surprised you would even ask such a question with such an obvious answer. I suspect you were simply pointing out a perceived injustice with a question founded in a <url> that you yourself did not take seriously ? __label__5 Well, I fully agree with the three rationales Lumos has given above; and so evidently do about half the Wikipedians who have contributed to the RfC Lumos has cited. If so many think that such links can be useful and appreciated, why does it matter so much to you that they should be eradicated ? __label__5 you are not giving us **nearly** enough detail to answer your question. First things first - is this a top down game, isometric, side scrolling ? __label__5 Is this a exercise in ideology? Views is very well suited to this task, why not use it ? __label__5 Six months ago was episode 10, and has peter not been in every episode up to and including that? Seriously, where are you getting your figures ? __label__5 Do you have a specific question? Or just, *"Here ' s my homework, please do it for me?"*__label__5 And DAB uses a very foul language, persistently, is that right? Did I not talk to you about that already ? __label__5 Maybe I ' m on crack, but in your edit summaries you ' re saying "MT" and "Not MT". What is MT an abbreviation for ? __label__5 You could try telling us what the errors you are getting are. Or are we supposed to guess ? __label__5 I don ' t know these tools, but re: *Ability to restrict password cracking* - I doubt that ' s what you mean - you really can ' t prevent someone from trying to crack a password hash, since it can be done on other machines. Do you mean restricted access to the password hashes ? __label__5 If possible, try using the VGA cable to hook the iPad up to a regular monitor. Does that give you the same result ? __label__5 You ' re still missing the point. How do the two sites meet <url>?__label__5 Sorry Olin, I ' m very much a noob who ' s running before I can walk. What do you mean by latch up and why should there be continuity ? __label__5 What you can ' t understand? Binary search at all or just authors description ? __label__5 Have you made sure that these calculations take place in code that is executed often enough to cause a performance impact? Or do I have to post the micro - optimization lecture again ? __label__5 Do you understand now what was wrong with your edits? What do you intend to do if unblocked ? __label__5 I know it is only after V3, but will there be at least the ability to retrieve the mod flag messages, or a count of the number of moderator flags at some point? Also will you at one point be willing to review the moderator ability features ? __label__5 Wow. You couldn ' t even format your test question correctly? How can we answer your homework for you if you can ' t even format it well ? __label__5 Post you linked to also has non - edit filter solution by Otto. Had you tried that ? __label__5 I can ' t help but think that you ' re making this much more complicated than it should be. HTML already handles word wrapping beautifully, why would you manually add line breaks to text that has characters with dynamic width ? __label__5 You ' re joking? <person> and <person> have no word play in spite of the same kanji ? __label__5 You lived next to her? What did you do wrong ? __label__5 bit or digit? the title of your question says digit, your question says bit, so what is it ? __label__5 So what ' s the problem? If you can read from server, then you don ' t know how to read if from local file, do you ? __label__5 Your algorithm is already converting it to coordinates in mercator coordinate system. What is your question ? __label__5 Maybe he wants to know why *usually* angular velocities are characterized by vectors and rotations by matrices. Is that your question ? __label__5 Just think about it. If, unlike Saudi Arabia, the US is the Land of the Free, then how come you are only allowed to drink <url>?__label__5 I do not, nor have I ever used other accounts on Wikipedia. Didn ' t you ask me this before ? __label__5 What did you end up choosing? I ' m looking at using custom layers or plug - in data source are there any more issues other than the ones you and Kirk mentioned ? __label__5 You told me that you couldn ' t access the page in question, although I had recently changed the link to its new location. Maybe you just didn ' t bother to check it out ? __label__5 I see no question here. What is your question ? __label__5 Can you clarify what "down" means? Have you turned on the display of error messages to see if anything is generated ? __label__5 Are you trying to help him milk the publicity over the WR incident? if it ends up on google with lots of nns why would that matter ? __label__5 So it ' s not really about the list, it ' s about those instructions? What exactly is the question then ? __label__5 Oh? You know something I don ' t, Friday ? __label__5 No this is security. (what would server fault have to do with injection?)__label__5 Notability is an issue of common sense: you ' re writing for other people, so what is notable for you (or me) is not that relevant. My local shop is more important and notable ''to me'' than Wal - mart, but who, other than me, actually cares ? __label__5 The link here in your question is giving me a database error; did you paste it incorrectly? Also, if you solved it, could you please post your solution here as an answer? :)__label__5 I have no idea how your matrix looks like or what you are really trying to do. Could you re - phrase the question ? __label__5  " Hablo ingles?". ROFLMAO ? __label__5 It ' s about freedom of speech and no Islamic terrorism is going to deter the truth from outing. And if it ' s forbidden to look at figures of Mohammed how come you did it; are you going to hell ? __label__5 excuse me ? - class ?__label__5 Maybe others haven ' t noticed - or are too busy. If you are thinking what I ' m thinking, why am I reverting so many of your edits ? __label__5 Fine, but it took me no more than a couple of seconds to find a source. Why couldn ' t you do it instead of removing the content ? __label__5 You do realise this is complete rubbish - it ' s already been speedily deleted once if you check the logs. I can ' t see any advantage to having this crap floating around for 5 days - can you ? __label__5 but how? where will i write the code snipt ? __label__5 You do `global $post`, but at the time `content _ save _ pre` runs, no `$post` object exists (since you are right before saving it). Could this be your problem ? __label__5 Updated!! any one??__label__5 Oh, how I hate such changed behaviour..^^ Why would you do that? If you write a letter in word, would you expect it to save the text in a file when hitting enter or should it begin an new line ? __label__5 I did notice that some articles linked to the ones I worked on are now missing, which leaves a link hanging. If you ' re going to delete articles, shouldn ' t someone clean up these broken links ? __label__5 Don ' t push it, Zachary. Can you give me proof of the existence of "MusicMaximum Hot 100"?__label__5 No - one ' s saying you can ' t edit anything, but what we are saying is that introducing grammatically incorrect phrases, POV, weasel words and things discussed and discounted in the numerous PRs and FLCs this article went through is inappropriate. Buc, stop it please, I ' m getting tired of this, why not work on being constructive to articles that aren ' t at featured status ? __label__5 How come no one will answer this question!??__label__5 The hash is used (often) to capture state, while a URL (as its [definition suggests](http://en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Uniform _ Resource _ Locator)) is for **identifying a resource**. So again, why would you push a non - existent url into the browser ' s history ? __label__5 Um , oops.. sorry for editing your question; thought I was editing an answer. Want me to pull that down into a comment ? __label__5 Huh? What was that supposed to mean ? __label__5 What do you mean by "how to charge"? Are you asking how much money to charge or how to implement an ad service and payment gateway ? __label__5 I don ' t think I ' ve used it in Wikipedia. So, if I haven ' t, why did you bring it up ? __label__5 Note: Kurt ' s talk page almost certainly isn ' t a good place to seek a broad or unbiased consensus on this question, nor is it the appropriate venue in which to request an exemption from a ban &mdash; and in all honesty, I ' m not sure that managing such an exemption for the purpose of posting gags would be a constructive use of anyone ' s time. Perhaps it would be best to save the jokes for a time when you ' re once again allowed to edit in the WP namespace, or post whatever jokes you wish (within reason) in your own user space ? __label__5 Why do you have this user name??__label__5 This REEKS of a question asked in a panic before an assignment is due. Nothing wrong with seeking clarification, but are we really here to answer verbatim questions ? __label__5 Hello - some of your writing is a bit hard to understand. Is English your first language, out of curiousity ? __label__5 How did I vandalize!!??__label__5 I can ' t think of any reason why this would be necessary. What are you trying to accomplish ? __label__5 Well this seems odd to me. Don ' t you find it strange that otherwise authoritative sources like Emulex and IBM would be so full of mistakes ? __label__5 Here, let me parse it out for you:''I regret that because Gravitor and Carfiend ' s behavior consists of acting in tandem (in the manner of meat or sock puppets), refuse to discuss disputed content on the talk page, and continally provoke revert wars that some administrative intervention is likely required. '' Is it clear now ? __label__5 Thanks, but I believe I ' ve covered the sustance. Could you also get Beeblebrox to strike the "Mr" insult, unless he was doing it deliberately ? __label__5 Yeah I have. Yes I know that; you saying I ' m a malicious admin ? __label__5 Did you try anything at all? Is this homework ? __label__5 Holy sh * t, $100 an hour? Where do I sign up ? __label__5 On a more practical note: One either does or doesn ' t agree to take part in mediation. Which is it, please ? __label__5 If you had such a list, what on earth would you do with it? The list of names in each category doesn ' t seem very interesting by itself; surely you don ' t want to actually process the content of all those grammars ? __label__5 Being too efficient can be detrimental - what if I was doing it in the wrong order - does that allow my reversion if indeed I do utilise the abbreviation? A simple enquiry might have been in order ? __label__5 Besides this isn ' t asking for a web app solution, rather a server side solution. Off Topic ? __label__5 why such a large file? Is this a one time thing or is this a on going problem ? __label__5 @tinker: In your comment right below the accepted answer you say *@Ivan: nope, adding chomp does not help. tinker 41 mins ago* Do you think this is funny ? __label__5 Can someone explain to me why this is not a real question. How is it off - topic to being a programmer? :|__label__5 This is incorrect. Have you looked at the article any time after October 2008 ? __label__5 What do you mean by protecting them? What are you trying to prevent / avoid ? __label__5 I ' m curious as to why you chose to <url> a full two minutes after my last comment? Am I to take this as a sign you are no longer willing to discuss the issue ? __label__5 ''Don ' t'' talk ''about'' me, in my virtual presence, and tell someone else to ignore me. Do you understand why this behavior is inappropriate ? __label__5 No, it is not needed. You know a penalty box was made for the kind of behavior you ' re exhibiting right now ? __label__5 Phones generally don ' t even ring for more than 30 seconds. Why do you want to do this ? __label__5 Thanks for the referrence. Do you have any other response to the Bozo who doubts notability ? __label__5 Unfortunately for those who like railroads, it ' s been closed again! DOn ' t you people have better things to do ? __label__5 You seem to have plenty of time to discuss, why don ' t you try to educate <url> ? Maybe he needs this more than me ?__label__5  ( Constantine and Leo are English, not Latin names.) Why don ' t you answer my question about Constantine the Great ? __label__5 And what did I do wrong??__label__5 You sure kill educating information. I wounder why ? __label__5 You question is very incoherent. Can you ask it more clearly ? __label__5 Blocked, templated. Next ? __label__5 @I Never Finish Anythi madness would be great Fun. How do I get infested by madness ? __label__5 This seems OT? @LBushkin, do you think this would be the right site for this kind of question ? __label__5 to the Citations missing template. What ' s the deal ? __label__5 That is an interesting problem, but would be time consuming and costly to determine every possible result. Why not create a buffer ? __label__5 Aren ' t those that you listed sufficient? What are you looking for ? __label__5 @littleadv and what ' s so strange? if I have this program running over bilion times, what ' s so strange, do you mind answering ? __label__5 Eight more articles semi - protected. How many of these damned T & J articles are there ? __label__5 I absolutely don ' t understand the question. What is this supposed to mean "and the difference between the scores of 10 and 18 relatively more higher than 18 and 20"?__label__5 In my calculation if I got blocked that would only be good for me as it would clear my mind from the obsession to try and change that which seems wrong and mutable, but carries no private benefits for the reformer. Is that line of thinking truly alien to you ? __label__5  " Malbrain, I can ' t understand you, in either your comments to the talk page.." is the criteria being used by user WHOSASKING to make reverts of my edits. Since when does any one editor have to understand all the material of a subject known by the other editors ? __label__5 Well? Shall I request outside assistance ? __label__5 What? Can you say what you question is in one sentence ? __label__5 Why not try adding sources from time to time? If you won ' t who do you expect to do so ? __label__5 You have a lot of cheek marking <url> with <person> without actually taking the trouble to say what needs fixing. If you ' re really someone who is able to contribute with a "professional" level of English, why not display this supposed proficiency rather than engaging in the illiterate practice of adding templates with tools ? __label__5 Please explain how that is a personal attack? You do realise that someone critisizing your actions is not the same as a personal attack don ' t you ? __label__5 Still references are quite informative. And nevertheless even if it is discussive and mentions something that is not present in the book it is some kind of a clue, isn ' t it ? __label__5 Apple => i = 0 => B [ i + 101] = B [ 101] = "0069", not "0041". Am I wrong or are you ? __label__5 Please stop mentioning my name in relation to FW. <url> How many times do I have to ask ? __label__5 Well, look again! Does ''<url>'' look like a dictionary - definition page to you ? __label__5 Re: <url> and <url>, if you think they are better off as redirects to the suburb / town rather than substubs on the lakes with a <nowiki><person></nowiki> tagline, you only need to overwrite the article with a redirect (or revert to a previous version that was a redirect), leaving the substub in the article history. How come you speedied them before redirecting ? __label__5  " New dictator?" Who ' s the old one? And who are "others in your gang"?__label__5 Since the "discussion" was not advertised at the affected pages, it did not involve the "community". Do you not see that ? __label__5 There was a redirect from KLPN to KTPN that was created. KLPN is the main station so why is the article called KTPN ? __label__5  _ Why_ are you trying to delay it? What do you expect to gain from that ? __label__5 How long can it possibly take to copy a ssh key to some remote system? Even over a dial - up line ? __label__5 Your edit makes parsenome ' s answer seem redundant. A bit unfair, no ? __label__5 Yeah, and why don ' t it try to convert 'abc' to int and add to 1? Apples + Bananas gives you what ? __label__5 And personally I ' m not gonna apologize for <url>. Quite a bit different than a Holocaust denier like Nordling, don ' t you think ? __label__5 I ' m just saying that Kingboyk hasn ' t really been editing lately. So if you ' re actually interested in resolving an issue, why not take it to a noticeboard ? __label__5 The C specification says tm _ years is "Years since 1900." Why not just stick to the standard and avoid this whole mess ? __label__5 And what is your question? Surely you don ' t expect a solution, as then you wouldn ' t have been doing your homework ? __label__5 What is wrong, are you making a comment to Elderathis answer, or are you adding your own answer? If you ' re adding your own answer please expand a bit on this, I don ' t believe the base Clockworkmod can help you unless you ' ve previously done full ROM backups, or follow the links on Elderathis post to get hold of the approriate ROMs (stock or custom)?__label__5  " issues"? What issues ? __label__5 Sigh. Was this renewed attack necessary now ? __label__5 Oh, lookee <url>: who put all the 'breakups' back with a blind revert??__label__5 I had no idea that I was such a rogue admin. Are you seriously suggesting that I need to be kicked off the project for closing a deletion debate ? __label__5 what exactly do you have in mind? Sampling or search applications ? __label__5 sounds suspiciously like homework. if it is, what have you done to solve the problem yourself ? __label__5 @Emil: Do you have a reference? Anything more recent than the ancient (1995) discussion linked in the OP ? __label__5 Wow! How has no one recommended SharePoint? Or is that telling in itself ? __label__5 I started thinking of how to copy - edit it, but then lost interest.. what is this thing that Americans have about writing about their bloody roads, for goodness sake? Can you imagine the <url> as a featured article, or having a "List of A - roads in Gloucestershire" as a featured list ? __label__5 No matter how efficient you are it is going to take a loong time to enumerate through 2^100 subsets of vertices, and that is before you get into the fact that edges can be there or not. Can you switch to a problem that is likely to finish before the Sun explodes ? __label__5 So what was the point of that? Are you looking to get blocked ? __label__5 So..what ' s up with this article? Is it a joke ? __label__5 So? Are you expecting us to do your homework for you?? :-) Ok , here ' s a hint.. what ' s the type of `"a" | "b"`?__label__5 So I got rid of it. Have a little faith in my good judgment, okay ? __label__5 Ya, seriously. 17 questions and no selected answers ? __label__5 Are you using GRUB2 or GRUB Legacy?. Can you post your grub config files ? __label__5 BTW, I ' m amazed that he has the gumption to show his mug after <url>. And do you have the balls (metaphorically or otherwise) to place a hatnote above his article linking to that term ? __label__5 Why are you trying to delete my user page, literally less than a minute after I began it. You are allowed one so why not me ? __label__5 I don ' t understand. If you had your problem solved .. why did you post a question ? __label__5 ? What ? __label__5 What a joke, this player has played league football all his career and some clown has now deleted it off, what kind of rules has this been deleted under then? "May be deleted" seems a bit of a poor excuse to me personally, fancy giving me some information as to why this has been deleted then guys ? __label__5 Of course I am not comparing to anything else. Otherwise, I won ' t be here, right ? __label__5 Seems like the troll committed suicide this morning. I don ' t know why; perhaps not enough fun ? __label__5 The press is calling you bisexual. Did you know that ? __label__5 i think there is a LOT of information you arent telling us. are there any examples of headers and footers you are trying to make ? __label__5 Your "resolution" was to move it back to "Detective Terry Crowley" again? Why do you keep doing that ? __label__5 I don ' t understand how you find it appropriate to talk about your illegal drug use on your user page. Also, how do you have the right to ban other people ' s usernames with a name like "''BONG''warrior"?__label__5 Seems like <url> has conveniently "quit" the wiki all of a sudden. That wasn ' t one of ''your'' sockpuppets, was it ? __label__5 Seriously? Seriously ? __label__5 pardon my ignorance, but what is a "game matchmaking service"? Is it like eHarmony for avatars ? __label__5 Wow! Trivial answer converted to comment! Is this new ? __label__5 Yeah, but playtime is over. Find some articles to edit, yes ? __label__5 @Kory, please elaborate, on what grounds do you suggest that? What do you suggest the problem is ? __label__5 Ruby doesn ' t even have an official spec, so I doubt that there ' s a properly correct answer. In any case, why do you need to know this ? __label__5 Error 500 means, that connect to Apache is working, but something behind it does not. What can you see in /var / log / apache2 / error . log after trying to see the page ? __label__5 How are the printers connected? Via network, or via usb ? __label__5 you will certainly find something on the spec. Have you tried ? __label__5 Did you change the Document type, or is it the standard one used by Drupal? Which error does Firebug report ? __label__5 By 'annoying alternate rows', are you talking about banding? Or what exactly is the problem ? __label__5 I ' m attempting to be incisive, and the articles integrity hasn ' t been disrupted. Therefore i see no reason why you chose to comment unless you felt that ive wiped out important information ? __label__5 And why exactly am I looking at your monobook? And why did you substitute your user links onto here ? __label__5 You say "My solution involves a tree", but surely that doesn ' t fall under the "using only bit manipulation" criteria, does it? As such, it ' s not really a solution is it ? __label__5 You *want* to see your password in your cookie? I suppose you like it when sites email you your *forgotten password* too ? __label__5 Who would be helped by this? Is all that work really going to help someone ? __label__5 Oh, no, sorry. Why do you want to talk to me on IRC ? __label__5 Why -1? what wrong with ppl here ? __label__5 Could you please elaborate on the problem ? What is happening when you try to access some https site ?__label__5 There seems to be a problem when attempting to obtain and parse the list of video devices, the Java engine crashes. What problems did you have with Skype, also iSight related ? __label__5 I don ' t see how you can use this to discount his trustworthiness and oppose him. If there is consensus to promote among several bureaucrats, what ' s it matter who actually presses the button ? __label__5 Why delete the page <url> with no explanation, as an act of deliberate vandalism? Why did you do it ? __label__5 @Guffa What exactly should I do to make it absolutely clear that I don ' t care what for my vote is used aside from the fact that it lets the OP know that his / hers way is the best in my opinion? Would you stop making remarks if I upvote your post ? __label__5 Are you unable to pee with a half filled bladder??__label__5 this has nothing to do with C#. Why did you add it as a tag ? __label__5 I ' d like to know why someone voted to close this as Off - Topic. Can you please explain your reasoning ? __label__5 WOW. PLEASE tell me that this will be going to FAC ? __label__5 This is tough because personal environments are usually already customized, so apples - to - apples comparisons are hard to come by. To start, you might indicate what your system is (Ubuntu version, hardware) and even include a relevant benchmark for your current set - up ? __label__5 This statement by The Four Deuces <url> makes little sense to me, does this user often obfuscate like this? The source is quite unambiguous in stating "communist terrorists" how on earth does this not mean the author is talking of communist terrorism ? __label__5 Corrections, make that four terms: I pick a car and swap, I pick a goat and swap, I pick a car and do not swap, I pick a goat and do not swap. Who cares about doors or door numbers ? __label__5 Vote down? Would you care to explain why ? __label__5 What kind of edging are you using? quarter round ? __label__5 Really annoying default behaviour. How did you disable it ? __label__5 OK, I ' ll bite. How is ''Matt "Dirty" Sanchez'' to be construed as anything other than a personal attack ? __label__5 Wow, is it my writing or what? This is my first ever question in StackOverflow and all I get is misunderstanding??__label__5 what exactly are you expecting to see? more than 1 server ? __label__5 @Joel, I don ' t have this problem here either (Android 2 . 2 on HTC EVO). Is it simply remembering a previous URL ? __label__5 Your title says "sorted array", but you ask about a BST in your question? Is this homework ? __label__5 But ''you ' re'' the one branding his work as anti - Semitic! See what I mean about bad faith ? __label__5 Soap on porous clay sounds like a good way to make your water taste like.. soap. Perhaps consider disinfecting with a bleach solution instead ?
